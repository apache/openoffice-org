<H2>Multi-User or Network Installation</H2>
<H3>Installation Phase 1</H3>
<P>The multi-user / network installation of OpenOffice.org is carried out in two phases. First, login as root or system administrator or as a normal user with corresponding system access rights on the target computer or network computer. Carry out the complete OpenOffice.org installation in a directory to which the users have read and execute access rights. Second, after the <B>Phase 1 </B> is complete, each user can log in to the system and perform a <B>Workstation Installation</B> of OpenOffice.org in a folder in his or her home directory.</P>
<P>To start up the Phase 1 installation, simply Invoke the setup program from the installation directory and add the parameter <B>-net.</B></P>

			<P>The <B>Phase 1</B> installation does not result in an OpenOffice.org version that can be run directly (even by root or the system adminstrator). Thus, if required, the root or the system administrator also has to carry out a workstation installation.</P>

<H4>Installation Requirements</H4>
<P>About 250 MB of space needs to be available on the target machine directory which is to contain the OpenOffice.org installation. During the installation about 20 MB space is required for temporary files. The temporary files will be automatically deleted after the installation has been completed successfully. Under Unix you will need a swap volume of about 80 MB.</P>

<H3>The Setup Procedure</H3>
<br>
<H4>Welcome</H4>
<P>The first thing to appear on the screen is a welcome dialog.</P>
<IMG SRC="img/setup_welcome.png">
<P>In many of the setup program dialogs you will see a <B>Help</B> button which displays brief information about the current dialog. After you have read the Help text, use the <B>Back</B> button to return to the setup program. Do NOT close the Help with the &quot;X&quot; system button (top right) as this would exit the setup program.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Confirm the Welcome dialog by clicking the <B>Next</B> button.</li>
</UL>
<br>
<H4>Important Information</H4>
<P>Now a window appears containing the <code>readme.txt</code> file (Windows) or <code>README</code> file (Solaris and Linux). This file can also be opened and read from the OpenOffice.org directory after the installation process is completed.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/setup_important.png">

<UL>
	<LI>Read the information and confirm by clicking <B>Next</B>.</li>
</UL>
<br>
<H4>License Agreement</H4>
<P>The next dialog contains the license agreement.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/setup_license.png">

<UL>
	<LI>Carefully read the license agreement. If you agree to all points, click <B>Accept</B> to continue with the installation. If you do not agree to the license agreement click <B>Cancel</B>. In the latter case OpenOffice.org will not be installed.</P>
</UL>
<br>
<H4>Type of Installation</H4>
<P>The next dialog in the OpenOffice.org setup program allows you to select the type of installation to be carried out.</P>
<P>The memory requirements shown here are approximates based on the cluster sizes of the next target directory containing sufficient free space.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/setup_type.png">

<P>When installing OpenOffice.org on a network server you should install all of the available components. To do this select the <B>Custom Installation</B> and select all of the options contained in the dialog following on from the next one in which a directory is chosen.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Select <B>Custom Installation</B>.</li>

<IMG SRC="img/setup_directory.png">

<P>In the top part of the dialog, there is a list of the drives on your system with details regarding how much space is required and how much space is available. The amount of memory required can differ due to different drives and cluster sizes.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>You can also select the installation path from a selection dialog by clicking <B>Browse</B> or by directly entering the path in the text box.

<P>As a rule, all of the components which have a colored box next to their name will be installed. If you do not want to install a particular component, click the box next to the name and it will change to gray. Each time you click one of the boxes, it will change from colored to gray or vice versa, and the corresponding component and all subordinate components will either be part of the installation (colored) or not part of the installation (gray).</P>
<P>When you click the plus sign next to the name of a component, a list of the subordinate components will be revealed. Again, clicking the individual boxes will either include the components in or exclude them from the installation. If a group entry contains components to be installed as well as components excluded from installation, the box in front of the group entry will appear semi-transparent. For example, the box in front of the OpenOffice.org Writer text filters is by default semi-transparent because the default setting does not include all filters.</P>
<P>You can use the <B>Default</B> button, to restore the settings that were originally shown when the dialog was opened for the first time.</P>

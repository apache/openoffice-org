   <h2>Understanding the UNCONFIRMED issue state</h2>

   <p>[This document is aimed primarily at people who may have used IssueZilla before the <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> state was implemented. It might be helpful for newer users as well.]</p>

   <p>New issues in some products will now show up in a new state, <code>UNCONFIRMED</code>. This means that nobody has confirmed that the issue is real. Very busy developers generally ignore <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> that have been assigned to them, until they have been confirmed in one way or another. (Developers with more time will hopefully glance over their <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> issues regularly.)</p>

   <p>There are two basic ways that an issue can become confirmed (and thus enter the <code>NEW</code>) state.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>A user with the appropriate permissions (see below for more on permissions) decides that the issue is a valid one, and confirms it.</li>

    <li>The issue gathers a certain number of votes. <b>Any</b> valid IssueZilla user may vote for issues (each user gets a certain number of issues); any <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> issue which gets enough votes becomes automatically confirmed, and enters the <code>NEW</code> state.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>That's why it is worthwhile to search the issue database for duplicates of your issue to vote on them <b><i>before</i></b> submitting your own issue. This helps to prevent issue duplication in the database.</p>

   <h3>Permissions and the UNCONFIRMED issue state</h3>

   <p>If you have the "Can confirm an issue" permission, then you will be able to change <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> issues to the <code>NEW</code> state.</p>

   <p>If you not have the "Can confirm an issue" permission, you can still <code>ACCEPT</code> or <code>RESOLVE</code> all issues assigned to you. IssueZilla keeps track of this. If this issue gets <code>REOPENED</code> or reassigned to someone else, it reverts back to the <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> state. If such an issue <i>has</i> been confirmed, then reassigning changes its status to <code>NEW</code> or <code>REOPENED</code>.</p>

   <p>If you have the "Can edit all aspects of any issue" permission, when you submit issues, these start out in the <code>NEW</code> state rather than the <code>UNCONFIRMED</code> state. You can override this feature, however, when you want to submit an issue as <code>UNCONFIRMED</code>.</p>

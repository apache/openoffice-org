   <h2>Joining a project</h2>

   <p>As a registered user on this site, you can go to any project's home page and see what's there. Likely as not, the Project Owner has made an effort to provide interesting material; in fact, it might be compelling enough to induce you to join. Joining projects (yes, you can join more than one) opens up greater access to the powerful features and development tools available to you on this site. The following section describes how to navigate this site to find information and join a project.</p>

   <p>This sequence comprises several steps. The index below contains a link to each step in the process of learning about a project and joining it. If you wish to follow through in the sequence, click on the next link below.</p>

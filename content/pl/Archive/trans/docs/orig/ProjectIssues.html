All development activities for each project hosted on 
    this site are tracked in a unique database. 
The <strong>Issue Tracking </strong>  link in the Project Resources toolbar displays the <b>Project Issues</b>           
          page, the entry point to that project's 
    issue database. Issue tracking provides the following benefits:&nbsp;
    <ol><p><li> Ability to chart&nbsp;the progress of individuals and the overall project
    
    
      <li>Tracking and maintainance&nbsp;of project history
      <li>Generation and reporting of&nbsp;ongoing to-do lists for all project 
    members.</li></ol>                                                           

<p>The different sections appearing in the <b>Project Issues</b> page indicate the following issue tracking options available to you:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><a href="ddIssues_Query.html"><b>Query Database of Issues</b></a> <dd>Search project issues by number, keywords, assignee, or other criteria.
<dt><a href="ddIssues_EnterModify.html"><b>Enter An Issue</b></a> <dd>Write and commit an issue report to the database.

<a name="aboutIZ"></a><span class="InputHeader">About IssueZilla</span>
<p>
IssueZilla is the issue tracking tool used on this 
    site.&nbsp; While it is a variant of BugZilla -- a bug tracking system you 
    may already be familiar with-- IssueZilla is a more generalized tool for 
    tracking many different kinds of activities in collaborative development 
    projects. Additionally, IssueZilla does not require a separate login as BugZilla does.&nbsp; IssueZilla classifies issues into several types:
      <ul><a href="ddIssues_EnterModify.html#issue_type">
       <li>Defects (a.k.a. "bugs")
       <li>Enhancements
       <li>Features
       <li>Tasks
       <li>Patches</a> </li>
      </ul>
<p>
Each hosted project on this site has it's own, unique 
    issues database. For open source projects in IssueZilla, all registered 
    users may query, view, and report issues, while proprietary projects limit 
    access to project members. 
    <p>
Project members have additional permissions within IssueZilla to modify and reassign issues, as well as generate reports. Project members are also notified automatically by email whenever issues are assigned to them or&nbsp;there is activity on issues affecting&nbsp;their work.
<p>
  Entering the tasks you're planning to work on as issues helps you devise and follow a work plan. Because everyone is aware&nbsp;of each project member's area of work, you can avoid duplicating efforts and even help out or offer feedback to other project members. Effective issue tracking requires an understanding of the IssueZilla tool and a working knowledge of what constitutes a well-written issue report.
<p>

<hr noshade size=1>     
     <a name="useraccounts"><span class="InputHeader">Setting your issue tracking user preferences</span></a><p>

     <p>When you join a hosted development project on this site, you automatically get an IssueZilla account for access to that project's issues.

     <p>Information about your account is available either 
    by clicking the <strong>My Preferences</strong> link on the <b>Project Issues</b> page.&nbsp; Once you have entered 
    the issue tracking area of the site you can&nbsp;click on the <strong>Edit 
    prefs </strong> link in the Issue Tracking toolbar, which appears in all issue tracking screens. You have several options to change your user settings:
     <p>
     <dl>
      <dt><b>Email settings</b> 
       <dd>Controls your automatic email notification settings. 
      <dt><b>Page footer</b> 
       <dd>Include/exclude "My issues" or your named, custom queries in every IssueZilla page footer.
    <dt><b>Permissions</b>
    <dd>Displays your issue tracking permissions but 
      cannot be changed because permissions are assigned by the Project Owner. 
      (See next section.)</dd>                     
   </dl>
     
     <p>
<hr noshade size=1>
     <a name="permissions"><span class="InputHeader"> About issue tracking permissions</span></a>
<p>
Once a user&nbsp;becomes a member of a project, 
    he&nbsp;or she&nbsp;is granted additional IssueZilla 
    permissions beyond the default database query capabilities. Permissions can 
    be viewed by&nbsp;clicking on the&nbsp; <strong>My Preferences</strong> link on the <b>Project Issues</b> page, or the <strong>Edit Prefs 
    </strong> link in the Issue Tracking toolbar.
<p>
    Issue tracking permissions depend upon project role:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Observers can&nbsp;create and modify issues, 
      but&nbsp;can make changes to&nbsp;only their own issues. Observers have the ability to comment on any issue.&nbsp;
<p></p>
<li>Developers&nbsp;(code or content) can report and 
      modify&nbsp;their own and other project&nbsp; issues. If they have been 
      granted&nbsp;the "Can edit all aspects of any issue" permission, they have the ability to alter all issue characteristics, including milestones and issue assignments. 
<p></p>
<li>Project initiators automatically are granted&nbsp;administrative level IssueZilla&nbsp; permissions&nbsp;with additional&nbsp;rights to 
      configure issue tracking for the&nbsp;project.&nbsp;Project initiators can also assign 
      IssueZilla-specific permissions to other project members.</li>                               
</ul>
                  Additional permissions can be requested through the project owner.&nbsp;You may need to request a new project role.
     <p>
       Permissions affect the&nbsp;lifecycle and resolution of issues. For example, if you have the "Can confirm an issue" permission, then you can change the status of any <b>UNCONFIRMED</b> issue to <b>NEW</b>             . A change in issue status sends an alert to the owner and all other project members associated with the issue.To understand more about issue status, read more about the 
     <a href="issue_lifecycle.html">lifecycle of issues</a>.

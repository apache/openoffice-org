<p>Hardly surprising, isn't it, that tunneling 
  using Mac OS 9 is trivially easy? The concepts are the same as for Windows, 
  Linux, or Mac OS X, as are the numbers, etc. But, in a nutshell, here's what 
  you do. It's a two-step process. First, you must configure MacSSH, then configure 
  the CVS client. 
<h4>Configuring MacSSH</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the latest version of <a href="hhttp://www.macssh.com">MacSSH,</a> 
    which is characteristically easy to use, is free, Open Source, and offers 
    superior performance.</li>
  <li>Configure it by clicking on the &quot;Favorites&quot; pull-down menu in 
    the top-navbar. </li>
  <li>Click on the &quot;New&quot; button.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for this favorite. If it is going to be your default, don't 
    bother. </li>
  <li>Host Name: openoffice.org</li>
  <li>Port: 22</li>
  <li>Terminal: default</li>
  <li>Go now to &quot;SSH2&quot; tab.</li>
  <li>Encryption: <b>3DES</b></li>
  <li>Authentication: <b>MD5</b></li>
  <li>Compression: <b>zlib</b></li>
  <li>Method: <b>Local TCP port forward</b></li>
  <li>Local port: <b>2401</b></li>
  <li> Remote host: <b>localhost</b></li>
  <li> Remote port: <b>2401</b></li>
  <li>You now must initialize (create) your SSH2 key pair. Click on the &quot;Initialize 
    SSH&quot; button. Follow instructions.</li>
  <li>Export your key (that is, put it elsewhere) by clicking on the &quot;Export&quot; 
    button. This allows you to easily place it in a directory or folder for submission 
    as an attachment to <a href="mailto:support@openoffice.org">support@openoffice.org.</a></li>
  <li>Once your key has been loaded by the helpful and friendly staff at OpenOffice.org, 
    you will be notified; and then you will be able to establish a tunnel. </li>
  <li>And, as is the case with tunnels: once established, there is no shell. At 
    most you will receive a message in a window saying that you are connected. 
    That is all. Leave this open, though you may minimize the window.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two free clients for Windows provide SSH tunneling:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html" target="_new">TTSSH</a>, an open-source add-on to Tera Term Pro

<li><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" target="_new">PuTTY</a>, a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 platforms. It also provides an XTerm terminal emulator. 

</ul>

<p>As with the Mac clients, the important things to keep in mind are
the hostname and the port numbers. For both terminals, the
configuration process is straightforward. Because TTSH is an add-on to
Tera Term, it means you have to go through that one extra step before
SSH functionality is possible. [A fuller description of tunneling with
TTSH is being drafted and will be posted when finished. For now,
please see TTSH's 
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~roca/ttssh.html" target="_new">website</a>.]

<p>PuTTY, on the other hand, does not allow you to easily configure the client to handle port forwarding. As a result, it is not recommended for tunneling.
<p>

<hr noshade size=1>
<a name="othersshclients"></a><span class="InputHeader">SecureCRT and F-Secure SSH</span>

<p>Both these clients are fairly easy to use and configure for SSH1 tunneling. The information you will need--doubtless familiar by now--is listed below.</p>


<p>The following illustrates the procedure; we will use SecureCRT (version 3.1.2):
<ol>

<li>Open a new session, specifying "SSH1" in the pull-down menu.</li>

<li>For "Hostname," enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">thisdomain.com</span>."</li>

<li>Click on the "Advanced" button by "Hostname."</li>

<li>Once in the Advanced section, click on the "Port Forwarding" tab.</li>

<li>For "Local port," enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">2401</span>."</li>

<li>For "Remote port" enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">2401</span>."</li>

<li>For Username, enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>."</li>

<li>For User password, enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>."

<li>For "Remote hostname," enter "<span class="TypewriterPlain">localhost</span>."</li>

<li>Enter "Save" and "OK" to exit the dialog box.</li>

<li>Back in the main connection page. . . .</li>

<li>Leave the defaults for "Cipher" and "Authentication" as they are.</li>

<li>Click on "Connect."</li>

<li>The server should then prompt for your password. It is "<span class="TypewriterPlain">tunnel</span>."</li>

<li>If this is your first time, the client will tell you that no "host key" for the server has been found and ask if you want to continue. Answer yes.</li>

<li>You are now tunneling.</li>

<li>The terminal screen does not show a prompt. That's how it should be. The tunnel has been established. You are now ready to begin using CVS securely.</li>

</ol>

<p>We discuss how to use the open-source desktop Unix emulator for Windows, Cygwin, in the section titled, <a href="ddSSHGuideCygwin.html">Tunneling using Cygwin</a>. Because Cygwin does emulate a Unix environment, complete with many Unix commands, those who are tunneling from a Unix-like environment (say, from a Linux machine), can refer to the discussion on Cygwin.

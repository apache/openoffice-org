<p>Site Search</p>
<p>The site search functionality filters through all pages on the site, with the 
  exception of mailing lists and cvs, for the criteria specified in the search 
  field. You can use the search field to quickly access pages of specific interest 
  to you. For instance, if you wanted to access information on open source, but 
  don't remember how to navigate through the site, you can enter &quot;open source&quot; 
  in the search field and click on the Go button. A search through all of the 
  pages on the site will return a page listing of the top 40 results of the search 
  entered in order of computed relevance. Each item title is linked to the page 
  so that you can access it by clicking on the link.</p>
<p>The site search allows you to use the boolean operators &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, 
  and &quot;not&quot; as well as a combination of any of these to refine your 
  search criteria.</p>
<p><b>And</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The &quot;and&quot; operator allows you to search for combinations of words 
    on the site. For example, entering a search for &quot;projects and users&quot; 
    will return all pages with references to projects and users. </p>
  <p><b>note:</b> if you enter two words with no operator between them, the site 
    search functionality assumes that you want to use the &quot;and&quot; feature. 
    Example, entering &quot;projects users&quot; will return the same results 
    as entering &quot;projects and users&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Or</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The &quot;or&quot; operator allows you to specify the search of two different 
    terms. An &quot;or&quot; statement will return all pages which includes either 
    term stated in the search criteria. For example, entering a search for &quot;projects 
    or users&quot; will return all pages that contain projects as well as all 
    pages that contain users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Not</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The &quot;not&quot; operator allows you to refine the criteria by excluding 
    specific terms from the search. For example, entering a search criteria of 
    &quot;projects not users&quot; will return all pages referencing projects 
    that do not also contain information about users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Complex strings</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You can use a combination of boolean operators to further refine your search. 
    For instance, entering a search string of &quot;projects and users not admin&quot; 
    will first search out all pages containing &quot;projects&quot; and &quot;users&quot; 
    then, from those selected, filter out pages containing &quot;admin&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site search does not include mail lists or cvs. Mail lists has it's own, 
  while cvs has no search mechanism.</p>
<p><b>Mailing lists</b> - have their own search mechanism. You'll be able to search 
  each mailing list from the archive page of the mailing list.</p>
<p><b>CVS</b> - does not have a search capability. In general, one should know 
  the location of the file to be used in cvs before attempting to check it out.</p>

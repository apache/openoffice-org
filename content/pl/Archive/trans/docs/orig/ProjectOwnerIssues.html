     <P>
     <P>Because you are a Project Owner, you automatically have administrative permissions in IssueZilla to manage and track your project's issues. You can access these administrative options two different ways:
  <UL>
  <LI>Your view of the <B>Project Issues</B> page includes additional sections to <I>Edit Users</I>, <I>Edit Groups</I>, and <I>Edit Components</I>.
  <P>
  <LI>All administrative options are included in the Issue Tracking toolbar, which appears in your view of all issue tracking screens.
  </UL>
<P>
Your role of Project Owner gives you the ability to configure almost every element of IssueZilla. Descriptions of these options and their default settings follows. Probably the most significant permission you have is the ability to edit the issue tracking permissions of all other users on your project. This can include delegating some of these administrative permissions to other users to help manage and plan the project workload.
     <P>
If one of your project members builds a solid track record of committing issues that get confirmed, this is probably a person who understands the project and the issue tracking system well enough to be granted the "Can confirm an issue" permission. As a project owner, you can and should use IssueZilla to track this kind of information about project participants to help you manage project issues effectively.
<P>
To learn how to assign issue tracking permissions to project members, see "Users" in the next section

<A NAME="admintips"></A><SPAN CLASS="InputHeader">Tips and tricks for issue management</SPAN>
<P>
IssueZilla is a powerful tool for managing and tracking your project's development activities down to the fine-grained details. As with most tools, users develop inevitably develop shortcuts and tricks to compensate for particular aspects of the tool, or to tailor it to their specific needs. IssueZilla is no exception.
<P>
What follows is a sampling of several tricks that have proved particularly useful to project managers or users with administrative issue tracking permissions:
<UL>
<LI>Avoid configuring the same management-level queries repeatedly by creating permanently displayed links to information you use constantly. For example, you can create a page of links for each project member's issue list, and for regularly used milestone or issue status queries.
<P>
<LI>Because issues may not be deleted, you can create components or subcomponents named "issue graveyard" or "unknown" to collect dead or no longer applicable issues. IssueZilla's non-delete feature is actually a protective design feature since the ability to track such dead issues can sometimes come in handy, or at least preserve aspects of project history.
<P>
<LI>Create a "not determined" milestone for project issues not yet tied to any particular project milestone date or release. Development project objectives and priorities tend to shift dynamically. This lets you identify and hold in reserve those issues affected by your project's evolution.
<P>
<LI>Add a pseudo user known as "placeholder" (or some other equally obvious generic identity) who can "own" issues that you are not yet ready or able to assign to specific project members.
</UL>

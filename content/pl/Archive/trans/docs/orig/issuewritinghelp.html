     <span class="InputHeader">Why you should read this</span>

   <span class="PlainText">
     <p>Simply put, the more effectively you report an issue, the more
     likely an engineer will actually fix it. <br> 
     <a href="http://IssueZilla.mozilla.org"></a><br> These issue writing
     guidelines are an attempt at a general tutorial on writing
     effective issue reports for novice issue writers; not every
     sentence may precisely apply to your software project.

     <p>
 <hr noshade size=1>
     <span class="InputHeader">How to write a useful issue report</span>
     <p>Useful issue reports are ones that get issues fixed. A useful issue report normally has two qualities:
     <ol>

      <li><span class=inputheader>Reproducible.</span> If an engineer
      can't see it or conclusively prove that it exists, the engineer
      will probably stamp it &quot;WORKSFORME&quot; or
      &quot;INVALID&quot;, and move on to the next issue. Every detail
      you can provide helps. <p>

      <li><span class=inputheader>Specific.</span> The quicker the
      engineer can isolate the issue to a specific problem, the more
      likely it'll be expediently fixed.(If a programmer or tester has
      to decipher an issue, they spend more time cursing the submitter
      than fixing or testing the problem.)

     </ol>

     <p>Let's say the application you're testing is a web browser. You
     crash at foo.com, and want to write up an issue report:


     <p><span class="InputHeader">BAD:</span> &quot;My browser
     crashed. I think I was on foo.com. My computer uses Windows. I
     think that this is a really bad problem and you should fix it
     now. By the way, your icons really suck. Nobody will use your
     software if you keep those ugly icons. Oh, and my grandmother's
     home page doesn't look right, either, it's all messed up. Good
     luck.&quot;

<br>
<br>

     <span class="InputHeader">GOOD: </span>&quot;I crashed each time
     when I went to foo.com, using the 10.28.99 build on a Win NT 4.0
     (Service Pack 5) system. I also rebooted into Linux, and
     reproduced this problem using the 10.28.99 Linux build.<br><br>
     It again crashed each time upon drawing the Foo banner at the top
     of the page. I broke apart the page, and discovered that the
     following image link will crash the application reproducibly,
     unless you remove the &quot;border=0&quot; attribute:
     <br>
     <br>
     &lt;IMG
     SRC=&quot;http://foo.com/images/topics/topicfoos.gif&quot;
     width=34 height=44 border=0 alt=&quot;News&quot;&gt;&quot;

<br>
<br>

     <p><span class=inputheader>How to Enter your Useful Issue Report into IssueZilla:</span>


<blockquote>
    <p>Before you enter your issue, use the IssueZilla Query Page to determine whether the
defect you've discovered is a known issue, and has already been reported. (If your
issue is the 37th duplicate of a known issue, you're more likely to annoy the engineer.
Annoyed engineers fix fewer issues.)<br><br>
Next, be sure that you've reproduced your issue using a recent build. (Engineers tend
to be most interested in problems afflicting the code base that they're actively
working on, rather than those in a code base that's hundreds of issue fixes obsolete.)<br><br>
If you've discovered a new issue using a current build, report it in IssueZilla:
</blockquote>


     <ol>
      <ol>

      <li>From your IssueZilla main page, choose &quot;Enter a new issue&quot;.

      <li>Select the product that you've found an issue in.

      <li>Enter your e-mail address, password, and press the
      &quot;Login&quot; button.  (If you don't yet have a password,
      leave the password text box empty, and press the &quot;E-mail me
      a password&quot; button instead. You'll receive an E-mail
      message with your password shortly.)

     </ol>
    <p>Now, fill out the form. Here's what it all means:
     </ol>



<blockquote>
    <p><span class=inputheader>Where did you find the issue?</span>

<blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Product: In which product did you find the issue?</span><br>
You just filled this out on the last page.</p>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Version: In which product version did you find the issue?</span><br>
If applicable.
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Component: In which component does the issue exist?</span><br>
IssueZilla requires that you select a component to enter an issue. (If they all look meaningless,
click on the Component link, which links to descriptions of each component, to help
you make the best choice.)</p>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Platform:&#160;On which hardware platform did you find this issue?</span>
(e.g. Macintosh, SGI, Sun, PC.)<br>
If you know the issue happens on all hardware platforms, choose 'All'. Otherwise, select
the platform that you found the issue on, or &quot;Other&quot; if your platform isn't
listed.</p>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">OS: On which Operating System (OS) did you find this issue?</span> (e.g.Linux, Windows NT, Mac OS 8.5.)<br>
If you know the issue happens on all operating systems, choose 'All'. Otherwise, select the OS that
you found the issue on, or &quot;Other&quot; if your OS isn't listed.</p>
</blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader"><br>How important is the issue?</span>
<blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Issue Type: Is this a defect, enhancement,
feature-request, or task?</span><br> This item defaults to
'defect'. (To determine the most appropriate type of issue,
click on the Issue Type link for a full explanation of each
choice.)
</blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader"><br>Who will be following up on the issue?</span>
<blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Assigned To: Which engineer should be responsible for fixing this issue?</span><br>
IssueZilla will automatically assign the issue to a default engineer upon submitting
an issue report; the text box exists to allow you to manually assign it to a different
engineer. (To see the list of default engineers for each component, click on the
Component link.)</p>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">Cc: Who else should receive e-mail updates on changes to this issue? </span><br>
List the full e-mail addresses of other individuals who should receive an e-mail
update upon every change to the issue report. You can enter as many e-mail addresses
as you'd like; e-mail addresses must be separated by commas, with no spaces between
the addresses.
</blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader"><br>What else can you tell the engineer about the issue?</span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p><span class="InputHeader">URL: On what URL did you discover this issue?</span><br>
If you encountered the issue on a particular URL, please provide it (or, them) here.
If you've isolated the issue to a specific HTML snippet, please also provide a URL
for that, too.

    <p><span class="InputHeader">Summary:</span> <span
    class="InputHeader">How would you describe the issue, in
    approximately 60 or fewer characters?</span><br> A good summary
    should <u>quickly and uniquely identify an issue
    report</u>. Otherwise, developers cannot meaningfully query by
    issue summary, and will often fail to pay attention to your issue
    report when reviewing a 10 page issue list.<br><br> A summary of
    &quot;PCMCIA install fails on Tosh Tecra 780DVD w/ 3c589C&quot; is
    a useful title. &quot;Software fails&quot; or &quot;install
    problem&quot; would be examples of a bad title.

    <p><br>

     <span class="InputHeader">Description: What else can you tell the engineer about this issue? </span><br>
Please provide as detailed of a problem diagnosis in this field as possible. <br>
<br>
Where applicable, using the following issue report template will help ensure that all
relevant information comes through:


    <blockquote>
      <p><span class=inputheader>Overview Description:</span> More detailed expansion of summary.

      <blockquote>
        <pre><font size="2">Drag-selecting any page crashes Mac builds in NSGetFactory</font></pre>

      Include any special setup steps. 

      <blockquote>
        <pre><font size="2">1) View any web page. (I used the default sample page, 
   resource:/res/samples/test0.html)
2) Drag-select the page. (Specifically, while holding down the 
   mouse button, drag the mouse pointer downwards from any point in 
   the browser's content region to the bottom of the browser's 
   content region.)</font></pre>

      </blockquote>
      <p><span class=inputheader>Actual Results:</span> What the application did after performing the above steps.

      <blockquote>

      present.

      <blockquote>
        <pre><font size="2">The window should scroll downwards. Scrolled content should 
be selected. (Or, at least, the application should not crash.)</font></pre>

      </blockquote>
      <p><span class=inputheader>Build Date &amp; Platform:</span> Date and platform of the build that you first
      encountered the issue in.

  <p>OpenOffice.org is a world-wide project. As such, it is important that it be available to as many linguistic communities as possible. There are two projects that seek to spread the use of OpenOffice.org over the various world languages. OpenOffice.org now supports almost all major languages, and support for many medium/minor languages has started. But help is always needed</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <p><b style="color:#a00">Localization (L10n)</b><br />
      The <a href="http://l10n.openoffice.org/">Localization project</a>'s task is to translate the OpenOffice.org interface into other languages. Thanks to this project, OpenOffice.org is now available in several dozen different languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b style="color:#a00">Native-lang Confederation (NLC)</b><br />
      The <a href="http://native-lang.openoffice.org/">Native Lang Confederation</a> provides a space for support, information, advocacy, and some development of OpenOffice.org in a person's native language.  The constituent projects work closely with the <a href="http://l10n.openoffice.org/">l10n Project</a> to ensure that OpenOffice.org is supported in all the languages to which it has been translated ("localized").</p>

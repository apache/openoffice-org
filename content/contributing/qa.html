<p>Quality Assurance (QA) is one of the most important but understated elements of any software community project. It is also something most people can do. If you want to help fix OpenOffice.org bugs, and you are not a programmer, you can still help by joining the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/">QA team</a>. The goal of the project is to respond to new issues posted by users as soon as possible as well as clear out the backlog of unconfirmed issues that currently resides in the Issue Tracker database.</p>
  <p>The QA team provides invaluable work for the development of OpenOffice.org. Yet, this is a project where anyone can help, regardless of your skill level or time constraints. Please visit the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/"> QA website</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>Page Not Found</h1>
<div class="message">
  <p>I'm terribly sorry, but I can't find the page you have requested.</p>
  <p>Believe me, I looked for it. Really! You can't even imagine the 
  millions of calculations I had to go thru to look in all the places
  my owner could have left what you asked for. But I couldn't find it. It's not there! :-(</p>
  <p>No, it's not your fault, it's all my own.  I'm a bad server.  I know.  Terrible.
  I should get a new job one day or another, but what else can I do?</p>

      <p>Apache OpenOffice is more than a collection of five superb tools.</p>
<p>Unlike some competitors, this suite was not created from a collection of separate pieces of software. From the start, it was designed as one complete office package.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All the packages have a similar &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; making them very easy to use, with common &ldquo;learn once use everywhere&rdquo; tools like the Stylesand Formatting. Apache OpenOffice takes its &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; from your computer - if you change your desktop, Apache OpenOffice will change to match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same tools are used consistently across the suite - for example, the tools you use to work with graphics within Writer are also found in Impress and Draw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don&quot;t need to know which application was used to create a particular file - you can &ldquo;File Open&rdquo; any Apache OpenOffice file from anywhere and the correct application will be launched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the packages share a common spell-checker, etc.; and if you change an &ldquo;Option&rdquo; in one package, it&quot;s changed in them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information can be transferred easily between all the packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the components save in OpenDocument format, the new international standard for office documents. This XML based format offers substantial disk savings compared to common competitors&rsquo; formats. It also means you can access your data  from any OpenDocument compliant software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the packages are installed in one single operation, using the installation process you are used to on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the packages are released under the same open licensing model - there are no hidden charges now or in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Free/Open-Source Software (F/OSS) proponents are turning to Apache OpenOffice both as end-users and as contributors. With its **flexible word processor**, **powerful spreadsheet**, **dynamic graphics**, **database access** and more, OpenOffice is the office suite of choice of millions of users.

OpenOffice is released under the OSI approved Apache License terms, with over 750 contributors and an international community approaching 400,000 individuals.

  - **Software for all**

    Apache OpenOffice is the must-have desktop application that tens of millions of people are using - an open-source tool that your family, friends, and neighbours will appreciate. With its free software licence and active international community, OpenOffice is a key player in the drive to eradicate digital exclusion and preserve minority languages threatened by being on the wrong side of the digital divide. For tens of thousands of community members, this makes the OpenOffice community their volunteering opportunity of choice.

  - **Open for development**

    Apache OpenOffice is a mature software product, representing over twenty years' continuous development. It is available across multiple operating systems. Understanding and contributing to the core development requires serious commitment and software engineering skills - not for the faint hearted. However, like all successful open-source projects, OpenOffice has an active developer community, keen to help new arrivals. Alternatively, try writing extensions, or using OpenOffice's UNO based components in other applications.

  - **Open world**

    If you are using Apache OpenOffice, you will appreciate the work that has gone into providing this software for you to use for free. Help us to ensure future users can continue to use it for free. The OpenOffice community invites contributors: *Whatever you do best, do it for OpenOffice*. As well as developers, the Community welcomes translators, artists, technical authors, testers, people offering user support, sales and marketing people, lobbyists, donors, ... the list is long. The Community operates internationally in all time zones, linked by the internet. Talk to us today.

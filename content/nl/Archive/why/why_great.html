<p>Great Software requires great people. Apache OpenOffice is the result of over twenty years&rsquo; continuous high quality software engineering. Designed from the start as a <strong>single piece of software</strong>, Apache OpenOffice has a consistency and a quality that is world class. Its <strong>open-source</strong> development model means there are no secrets.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Better by design</strong></p>
<p>Developed over twenty years, Apache OpenOffice is a mature, reliable, product. OpenOffice was designed from the start as a single piece of software - not bolted together from separate software packages. This makes it very consistent and easy to use - what you learn in one application is immediately usable in another. The context-sensitive help works across all applications, unobtrusively providing the precise help you need. You can even open any type of document from any application - OpenOffice is really one piece of software. It also runs on all major computing platforms - Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Apple Mac - isn&rsquo;t that great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Better for you</strong></p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice contains all the office software you need, in one single package. You don&rsquo;t have to worry which version to install: one installation program provides everything. The installation also includes features which some expensive rivals do not - for example, the ability to create .pdf files when you want to guarantee what the recipient sees on their computer. There is also a growing range of extensions: additional features that any developer can provide. The Apache OpenOffice project releases software several times a year so you can take advantage of new features as quickly as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Honest software</strong></p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice is developed using an open-software, &ldquo;no secrets&rdquo; approach. Anyone can look at the programs and suggest improvements, or fix bugs. Anyone can report problems or request enhancements, and anyone can see the response from other users or developers. The status of current and future releases is displayed on a public wiki, so you can decide if and when you want to upgrade to take advantage of new features. Anyone used to commercial software and its hyping and marketing speak will find Apache OpenOffice refreshingly different. Enjoy the benefits of open-source!</p>

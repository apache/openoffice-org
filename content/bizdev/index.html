	<h1>Welcome to the Apache OpenOffice Business Development Project</h1>
	

<p>This project is dedicated to help businesses and institutions making business based on OpenOffice. Here you will find a business directory with information on businesses providing services like consulting or training, 
	support and development on OpenOffice. Also, a mailing list where you can look for and make contacts with potential partners and customers. </p>
<p>Since we believe that a space for your business is needed on OpenOffice, we can set up a mailing list in this project and help you answer business opportunities on OpenOffice</p>

<h2>Consultant list</h2>
<p>Make sure to check our <a href="consultants.html">consultant list</a> where you can add your business as an OpenOffice service provider.</p>
<h2>To-Dos</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Case Studies. There are lots of businesses that need to be contacted using the templates created. We also need to make those more widely available. At OOoCon we concluded that case studies are enormously important and need to go ahead. </li>
  <li>Contacting derivatives of OOo. We have a list of those selling derivatives of OOo. I have asked the members of this list to contact them, if they feel up to it. The idea is simple: to see if they (the derivative makers) will contribute back to OOo.</li>
  <li>ISVs. OpenOffice.org is increasingly being distributed by ISVs, and we need to work with them to ensure a satisfactory result as well as to publicize the work being done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other points.... if you want to add to this very brief list, please subscribe to <a href="dev@openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org</a> and send in your suggestion. </p>

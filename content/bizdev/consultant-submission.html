<h1>How to submit your professional services listing</h1>
<p>The Apache OpenOffice project offers a list of relevant practioners of interest to Apache OpenOffice users.  No endorsement is implied by these listings.
If you would like to have your listing added to this page, please follow these instructions:</p>

<ol>

    <li>Listings must be factual and specifically relevant to OpenOffice.  Generic IT services companies without a specific offering on their website directly relevant to OpenOffice
        would probably not be a good fit for these listings.  In other words, if your website is not mentioning OpenOffice, why should our website mention you?</li>
    <li>You should review the <a href="consultants.html">current consultants directory</a> to see the expected contents and format.</li>
    <li>Further useful information for preparing your submission can be found in the <a href="#submission-details">Submission Details</a> section below.</li>
    <li>Listings and the websites and email addresses referenced must <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/">respect ASF trademarks</a>.  Note: Our official name is now
        Apache OpenOffice&reg;.</li>
    <li>Listings must not imply approval, endorsement or affiliation with the Apache OpenOffice project or the ASF.</li>
    <li>Listings with invalid links, 404 errors, etc., may be removed.  Please keep your listing up-to-date.</li>
    <li>Listings must be submitted to the <a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#development-mailing-list">dev</a> mailing list for review by the
        Project Management Committee.</li>
     <li>Although we are happy to receive text submissions (See the <a href="#example-submission">Example Submission</a> below, submissions made as patches to our XML file are
         easier for us to integrate and are greatly appreciated.  See the <a href="#xml-submissions">XML Submissions</a> section for more information.</li>
    <li>All listings appear soley at the discretion of the Apache OpenOffice PMC.  If you have any questions on the above, please ask on
            the <a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#development-mailing-list">dev</a> mailing list.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#how-to-get-started" id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</a></h2>
<p>OpenOffice is a large, complex open source project, with a culture developed over many years as an independent project, combined with our experience at Apache.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Apache-style open source development then you might just jump in. Subscribe to the <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html#recruitment-mailing-list-public">recruitment mailing list</a> and introduce yourself. We&rsquo;ll help you get started.</p>
<p>If, however, you are new to Apache, or want a more methodical approach to getting started, then we have a set of graduated <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/index.html">New Volunteer Orientation Modules</a> designed for new volunteers that takes you through a number of background topics related to OpenOffice and how we do things.</p>
<p>Which path you take is up to you and is a matter of personal preference. You can even do both.</p>
<p>We also maintain a list of specific areas where we need volunteers on our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Help+Wanted">Help Wanted</a> page of the wiki.</p>
<p>If you are a student, looking to contribute to the project as part of your school work, please also see our <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/students.html">Advice for Students</a> page.</p>

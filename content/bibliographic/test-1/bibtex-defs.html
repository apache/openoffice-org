<h2>Bibtex Entry Types, Field Types and Usage Hints</h2>
<p><a name="latex-appendix"></a>This document is simply a corrected
version of Appendix&nbsp;B.2 of the L<sup>A</sup>TEX
book&nbsp;[<a href="btxdoc.html#latex">2</a>], &copy;&nbsp;1986, by
Addison-Wesley. The basic scheme is the same, only a few details
have changed.</p>
<p>[These are the defacto standard for bibliographic data
types.</p>
<p>The advise is for the use of the L<sup>A</sup>TEX text
processing application but there is some general hints as well. -
David Wilson]</p>
<h3>1 Entry Types</h3>
<p>When entering a reference in the database, the first thing to
decide is what type of entry it is. No fixed classification scheme
can be complete, but provides enough entry types to handle almost
any reference reasonably well.</p>
<p>References to different types of publications contain different
information; a reference to a journal article might include the
volume and number of the journal, which is usually not meaningful
for a book. Therefore, database entries of different types have
different fields. For each entry type, the fields are divided into
three classes:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>required</strong></dt>
<dd>Omitting the field will produce a warning message and, rarely,
a badly formatted bibliography entry. If the required information
is not meaningful, you are using the wrong entry type. However, if
the required information is meaningful but, say, already included
is some other field, simply ignore the warning.</dd>
<dt><strong>optional</strong></dt>
<dd>The field's information will be used if present, but can be
omitted without causing any formatting problems. You should include
the optional field if it will help the reader.</dd>
<dt><strong>ignored</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The field is ignored. Ignores any field that is not required or
optional, so you can include any fields you want in a <tt>bib</tt>
file entry. It's a good idea to put all relevant information about
a reference in its <tt>bib</tt> file entry--even information that
may never appear in the bibliography. For example, if you want to
keep an abstract of a paper in a computer file, put it in an
<tt>abstract</tt> field in the paper's <tt>bib</tt> file entry. The
<tt>bib</tt> file is likely to be as good a place as any for the
abstract, and it is possible to design a bibliography style for
printing selected abstracts. Note: Misspelling a field name will
result in its being ignored, so watch out for typos (especially for
optional fields, since won't warn you when those are
missing).</p></dd></dl>
<p>The following are the standard entry types, along with their
required and optional fields, that are used by the standard
bibliography styles. The fields within each class (required or
optional) are listed in order of occurrence in the output, except
that a few entry types may perturb the order slightly, depending on
what fields are missing. These entry types are similar to those
adapted by Brian Reid from the classification scheme of
van&nbsp;Leunen&nbsp;[<a href="btxdoc.html#van-leunen">4</a>] for
use in the <i>Scribe</i> system. The meanings of the individual
fields are explained in the next section. Some nonstandard
bibliography styles may ignore some optional fields in creating the
reference. Remember that, when used in the <tt>bib</tt> file, the
entry-type name is preceded by an <tt>@</tt> character.</p>

<p>In addition to the fields listed above, each entry type also has
an optional <tt>key</tt> field, used in some styles for
alphabetizing, for cross referencing, or for forming a
<code>\bibitem</code> label. You should include a <tt>key</tt>
field for any entry whose ``author'' information is missing; the
``author'' information is usually the <tt>author</tt> field, but
for some entry types it can be the <tt>editor</tt> or even the
<tt>organization</tt> field (Section&nbsp;<a href=
"btxdoc.html#odds-and-ends">4</a> describes this in more detail).
Do not confuse the <tt>key</tt> field with the key that appears in
the <code>\cite</code> command and at the beginning of the database
entry; this field is named ``key'' only for compatibility with
<i>Scribe</i>.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#Project">Top of Page</a></div>
<h2>2 Fields</h2>
<p>Below is a description of all fields recognized by the standard
bibliography styles. An entry can also contain other fields, which
are ignored by those styles.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>address</strong></dt>
<dd>Usually the address of the <tt>publisher</tt> or other type of
institution. For major publishing houses, van&nbsp;Leunen
recommends omitting the information entirely. For small publishers,
on the other hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete
address.</dd>
<dt><strong>annote</strong></dt>
<dd>An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography
styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
bibliography.</dd>
<dt><strong>author</strong></dt>
<dd>The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
L<sup>A</sup>TEX book.</dd>
<dt><strong>booktitle</strong></dt>
<dd>Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the
L<sup>A</sup>TEX book for how to type titles. For book entries, use
the <tt>title</tt> field instead.</dd>
<dt><strong>chapter</strong></dt>
<dd>A chapter (or section or whatever) number.</dd>
<dt><strong>crossref</strong></dt>
<dd>The database key of the entry being cross referenced.</dd>
<dt><strong>edition</strong></dt>
<dd>The edition of a book--for example, ``Second''. This should be
an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown
here; the standard styles convert to lower case when
necessary.</dd>
<dt><strong>editor</strong></dt>
<dd>Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the
L<sup>A</sup>TEX book. If there is also an <tt>author</tt> field,
then the <tt>editor</tt> field gives the editor of the book or
collection in which the reference appears.</dd>
<dt><strong>howpublished</strong></dt>
<dd>How something strange has been published. The first word should
be capitalized.</dd>
<dt><strong>institution</strong></dt>
<dd>The sponsoring institution of a technical report.</dd>
<dt><strong>journal</strong></dt>
<dd>A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals;
see the <i>Local Guide</i>.</dd>
<dt><strong>key</strong></dt>
<dd>Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
when the ``author'' information (described in
   Section&nbsp;<a href="btxdoc.html#odds-and-ends">4</a>) is
   missing. This field should not be confused with the key that
   appears in the <code>\cite</code> command and at the beginning
   of the database entry.</dd>
<dt><strong>month</strong></dt>
<dd>The month in which the work was published or, for an
unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the
standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3
of the L<sup>A</sup>TEX book.</dd>
<dt><strong>note</strong></dt>
<dd>Any additional information that can help the reader. The first
word should be capitalized.</dd>
<dt><strong>number</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
given numbers in a named series.</dd>
<dt><strong>organization</strong></dt>
<dd>The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a
manual.</dd>
<dt><strong>pages</strong></dt>
<dd>One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as
<tt>42-111</tt> or <tt>7,41,73-97</tt> or <tt>43+</tt> (the
`<tt>+</tt>' in this last example indicates pages following that
don't form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain
<i>Scribe</i>-compatible databases, the standard styles convert a
single dash (as in <tt>7-33</tt>) to the double dash used in TEX to
denote number ranges (as in <tt>7-33</tt>).</dd>
<dt><strong>publisher</strong></dt>
<dd>The publisher's name.</dd>
<dt><strong>school</strong></dt>
<dd>The name of the school where a thesis was written.</dd>
<dt><strong>series</strong></dt>
<dd>The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire
book, the the <tt>title</tt> field gives its title and an optional
<tt>series</tt> field gives the name of a series or multi-volume
set in which the book is published.</dd>
<dt><strong>title</strong></dt>
<dd>The work's title, typed as explained in the L<sup>A</sup>TEX
book.</dd>
<dt><strong>type</strong></dt>
<dd>The type of a technical report--for example, ``Research
Note''.</dd>
<dt><strong>volume</strong></dt>
<dd>The volume of a journal or multivolume book.</dd>
<dt><strong>year</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it
was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as
<tt>1984</tt>, although the standard styles can handle any
<tt>year</tt> whose last four nonpunctuation characters are
numerals, such as `(about 1984)'.</p></dd></dl>

<h1>3 Helpful Hints</h1>
<p><a name="odds-and-ends"></a>This section gives some random tips
that aren't documented elsewhere, at least not in this detail. They
are, roughly, in order of least esoteric to most. First, however, a
brief spiel.</p>
<p>I understand that there's often little choice in choosing a
bibliography style--journal says you must use &lsquo;style&rsquo;
and that's that. If you have a choice, however, I strongly
recommend that you choose something like the <tt>plain</tt>
standard style. Such a style, van&nbsp;Leunen&nbsp;[<a href=
"btxdoc.html#van-leunen">4</a>] argues convincingly, encourages
better writing than the alternatives--more concrete, more
vivid.</p>
<p><i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>&nbsp;[<a href=
"btxdoc.html#chicago">1</a>], on the other hand, espouse the
author-date system, in which the citation might appear in the text
as `(Jones, 1986)'. I argue that this system, besides cluttering up
the text with information that may or may not be relevant,
encourages the passive voice and vague writing. Furthermore the
strongest arguments for using the author-date system--like ``it's
the most practical''--fall flat on their face with the advent of
computer-typesetting technology. For instance the <i>Chicago
Manual</i> contains, right in the middle of page&nbsp;401, this
anachronism: ``The chief disadvantage of [a style like
<tt>plain</tt>] is that additions or deletions cannot be made after
the manuscript is typed without changing numbers in both text
references and list.'' L<sup>A</sup>TEX, obviously, sidesteps the
disadvantage.</p>
<p>Finally, the logical deficiencies of the author-date style are
quite evident once you've written a program to implement it. For
example, in a large bibliography, using the standard alphabetizing
scheme, the entry for `(Aho et&nbsp;al., 1983b)' might be half a
page later than the one for `(Aho et&nbsp;al., 1983a)'. Fixing this
problem results in even worse ones. What a mess. (I have,
unfortunately, programmed such a style, and if you're saddled with
an unenlightened publisher or if you don't buy my propaganda, it's
available from the Rochester style collection.)</p>
<p>Ok, so the spiel wasn't very brief; but it made me feel better,
and now my blood pressure is back to normal. Here are the tips for
using with the standard styles (although many of them hold for
nonstandard styles, too).</p>
<ol>
<li>With 's style-designing language you can program general
database manipulations, in addition to bibliography styles. For
example it's a fairly easy task for someone familiar with the
language to produce a database-key/author index of all the entries
in a database. Consult the <i>Local Guide</i> to see what tools are
available on your system.</li>
<li>The standard style's thirteen entry types do reasonably well at
formatting most entries, but no scheme with just thirteen formats
can do everything perfectly. Thus, you should feel free to be
creative in how you use these entry types (but if you have to be
too creative, there's a good chance you're using the wrong entry
type).</li>
<li>Don't take the field names too seriously. Sometimes, for
instance, you might have to include the publisher's address along
with the publisher's name in the <tt>publisher</tt> field, rather
than putting it in the <tt>address</tt> field. Or sometimes,
difficult entries work best when you make judicious use of the
<tt>note</tt> field.</li>
<li>Don't take the warning messages too seriously. Sometimes, for
instance, the year appears in the title, as in <i>The 1966 World
Gnus Almanac</i>. In this case it's best to omit the <tt>year</tt>
field and to ignore 's warning message.</li>
<li>If you have too many names to list in an <tt>author</tt> or
<tt>editor</tt> field, you can end the list with ``and others'';
the standard styles appropriately append an ``et&nbsp;al.''</li>
<li>
<p>In general, if you want to keep from changing something to lower
case, you enclose it in braces. You might not get the effect you
want, however, if the very first character after the left brace is
a backslash. The ``special characters'' item later in this section
explains.</p></li>
<li>
<p>For <i>Scribe</i> compatibility, the database files allow an
<tt>@COMMENT</tt> command; it's not really needed because</p>
<p>allows in the database files any comment that's not within an
entry. If you want to comment out an entry, simply remove the
`<tt>@</tt>' character preceding the entry type.</p></li>
<li>The standard styles have journal abbreviations that are
computer-science oriented; these are in the style files primarily
for the example. If you have a different set of journal
abbreviations, it's sensible to put them in <tt>@STRING</tt>
commands in their own database file and to list this database file
as an argument to L<sup>A</sup>TEX's <code>\bibliography</code>
command (but you should list this argument before the ones that
specify real database entries).</li>
<li>
<p>It's best to use the three-letter abbreviations for the month,
rather than spelling out the month yourself. This lets the
bibliography style be consistent. And if you want to include
information for the day of the month, the <tt>month</tt> field is
usually the best place. For example</p>
<pre>
    month = jul # "~4,"
</pre>
<p>will probably produce just what you want.</p></li>
<li style="list-style: none">
<div align="right"><a href="#Project">Top of Page</a></div></li>
<li>If you're using the <tt>unsrt</tt> style (references are listed
in order of citation) along with the <code>\nocite{*}</code>
feature (all entries in the database are included), the placement
of the <code>\nocite{*}</code> command within your document file
will determine the reference order. According to the rule given in
Section&nbsp;<a href="btxdoc.html#features">2.1</a>: If the command
is placed at the beginning of the document, the entries will be
listed in exactly the order they occur in the database; if it's
placed at the end, the entries that you explicitly
<code>\cite</code> or <code>\nocite</code> will occur in citation
order, and the remaining database entries will be in database
order.</li>
<li>For theses, van Leunen recommends not giving the school's
department after the name of the degree, since schools, not
departments, issue degrees. If you really think that giving the
department information will help the reader find the thesis, put
that information in the <tt>address</tt> field.</li>
<li>The <tt>MASTERSTHESIS</tt> and <tt>PHDTHESIS</tt> entry types
are so named for <i>Scribe</i> compatibility; <tt>MINORTHESIS</tt>
and <tt>MAJORTHESIS</tt> probably would have been better names.
Keep this in mind when trying to classify a non-U.S. thesis.</li>
<li>
<p>Here's yet another suggestion for what to do when an author's
name appears slightly differently in two publications. Suppose, for
example, two journals articles use these fields.</p>
<pre>
    author = "Donald E. Knuth"
    .  .  .
    author = "D. E. Knuth"
</pre>
<p>There are two possibilities. You could (1)&nbsp;simply leave
them as is, or (2)&nbsp;assuming you know for sure that these
authors are one and the same person, you could list both in the
form that the author prefers (say, `Donald&nbsp;E. Knuth'). In the
first case, the entries might be alphabetized incorrectly, and in
the second, the slightly altered name might foul up somebody's
electronic library search. But there's a third possibility, which
is the one I prefer. You could convert the second journal's field
to</p>
<pre>
    author = "D[onald] E. Knuth"
</pre>
<p>This avoids the pitfalls of the previous two solutions, since
alphabetizes this as if the brackets weren't there, and since the
brackets clue the reader in that a full first name was missing from
the original. Of course it introduces another
pitfall--`D[onald]&nbsp;E. Knuth' looks ugly--but in this case I
think the increase in accuracy outweighs the loss in
aesthetics.</p></li>
<li>L<sup>A</sup>TEX's comment character `<tt>%</tt>' is not a
comment character in the database files.</li>
<li>Here's a more complete description of the ``author''
information referred to in previous sections. For most entry types
the ``author'' information is simply the <tt>author</tt> field.
However: For the <tt>BOOK</tt> and <tt>INBOOK</tt> entry types it's
the <tt>author</tt> field, but if there's no author then it's the
<tt>editor</tt> field; for the <tt>MANUAL</tt> entry type it's the
<tt>author</tt> field, but if there's no author then it's the
<tt>organization</tt> field; and for the <tt>PROCEEDINGS</tt> entry
type it's the <tt>editor</tt> field, but if there's no editor then
it's the <tt>organization</tt> field.</li>
<li>
<p>When creating a label, the <tt>alpha</tt> style uses the
``author'' information described above, but with a slight
change--for the <tt>MANUAL</tt> and <tt>PROCEEDINGS</tt> entry
types, the <tt>key</tt> field takes precedence over the
<tt>organization</tt> field. Here's a situation where this is
useful.</p>
<pre>
   organization = "The Association for Computing Machinery",
   key = "ACM"
</pre>
<p>Without the <tt>key</tt> field, the <tt>alpha</tt> style would
make a label from the first three letters of information in the
<tt>organization</tt> field; <tt>alpha</tt> knows to strip off the
`<tt>The</tt> ', but it would still form a label like `[Ass86]',
which, however intriguing, is uninformative. Including the
<tt>key</tt> field, as above, would yield the better label
`[ACM86]'.</p>
<p>You won't always need the <tt>key</tt> field to override the
<tt>organization</tt>, though: With</p>
<pre>
    organization = "Unilogic, Ltd.",
</pre>
<p>for instance, the <tt>alpha</tt> style would form the perfectly
reasonable label `[Uni86]'.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Section&nbsp;<a href="btxdoc.html#features">2.1</a> discusses
accented characters. To , an accented character is really a special
case of a ``special character'', which consists of everything from
a left brace at the top-most level, immediately followed by a
backslash, up through the matching right brace. For example in the
field</p>
<pre>
    author = "\AA{ke} {Jos{\'{e}} {\'{E}douard} G{\"o}del"
</pre>
<p>there are just two special characters,
`<code>{\'{E}douard}</code>' and `<code>{\"o}</code>' (the same
would be true if the pair of double quotes delimiting the field
were braces instead). In general,</p>
<p>will not do any processing of a TEX or L<sup>A</sup>TEX control
sequence inside a special character, but it <i>will</i> process
other characters. Thus a style that converts all titles to lower
case would convert</p>
<pre>
    The {\TeX BOOK\NOOP} Experience
</pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre>
    The {\TeX book\NOOP} experience
</pre>
<p>(the `<tt>The</tt>' is still capitalized because it's the first
word of the title). This special-character scheme is useful for
handling accented characters, for getting 's alphabetizing to do
what you want, and, since counts an entire special character as
just one letter, for stuffing extra characters inside labels. The
file <tt>XAMPL.BIB</tt> distributed with gives examples of all
three uses.</p></li>
<li>
<p>This final item of the section describes 's names (which appear
in the <tt>author</tt> or <tt>editor</tt> field) in slightly more
detail than what appears in Appendix&nbsp;B of the L<sup>A</sup>TEX
book. In what follows, a ``name'' corresponds to a person. (Recall
that you separate multiple names in a single field with the word
``and'', surrounded by spaces, and not enclosed in braces. This
item concerns itself with the structure of a single name.)</p>
<p>Each name consists of four parts: First, von, Last, and&nbsp;Jr;
each part consists of a (possibly empty) list of name-tokens. The
Last part will be nonempty if any part is, so if there's just one
token, it's always a Last token.</p>
<p>Recall that Per Brinch&nbsp;Hansen's name should be typed</p>
<pre>
    "Brinch Hansen, Per"
</pre>
<p>The First part of his name has the single token ``Per''; the
Last part has two tokens, ``Brinch'' and ``Hansen''; and the von
and Jr parts are empty. If you had typed</p>
<pre>
    "Per Brinch Hansen"
</pre>
<p>instead, would (erroneously) think ``Brinch'' were a First-part
token, just as ``Paul'' is a First-part token in ``John&nbsp;Paul
Jones'', so this erroneous form would have two First tokens and one
Last token.</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<pre>
    "Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\'e}e Poussin"
</pre>
<p>This name has four tokens in the First part, two in the von, and
two in the Last. Here</p>
<p>knows where one part ends and the other begins because the
tokens in the von part begin with lower-case letters.</p>
<p>In general, it's a von token if the first letter at
brace-level&nbsp;0 is in lower case. Since technically everything
in a ``special character'' is at brace-level&nbsp;0, you can
trick</p>
<p>into thinking that a token is or is not a von token by
prepending a dummy special character whose first letter past the
TEX control sequence is in the desired case, upper or lower.</p>
<p>To summarize,</p>
<p>allows three possible forms for the name:</p>
<pre>
    "First von Last"
    "von Last, First"
    "von Last, Jr, First"
</pre>
<p>You may almost always use the first form; you shouldn't if
either there's a Jr part, or the Last part has multiple tokens but
there's no von part.</p></li></ol>

<h2 align="center">BibTeX</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
BibTeX is a program and file format designed by Oren Patashnik and
Leslie Lamport in 1985 for the LaTeX document preparation system.
The format is entirely character based, so it can be used by any
program (although the standard character set for accents is TeX).
It is field (tag) based and the BibTeX program will ignore unknown
fields, so it is expandable. It is probably the most common format
for bibliographies on the Internet.

<h3>Software Support</h3>
The BibTeX program uses <a href=
"http://jasper.ora.com/texhelp/bibtx-50.html">style files</a>, a
list of citations from LaTeX, and a BibTeX database to create a
LaTeX file listing the cited references. 
<p>Dana Jacobsen maintains a <a href=
"http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jacobsd/bib/tools/bibtex.html">list
of some BibTeX tools</a>.</p>
<p>If you're looking for BibTeX for the Mac, Vince Darley has done
a <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~darley/MacBibTeX.html">port
of BibTeX to the Mac</a>.</p>
<p><a href=

and BibDB both fully support BibTeX.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
@article{Gettys90,
   author = {Jim Gettys and Phil Karlton and Scott McGregor},
   title = {The {X} Window System, Version 11},
   journal = {Software Practice and Experience},
   volume = {20},
   number = {S2},
   year = {1990},
   abstract = {A technical overview of the X11 functionality.  This is an update
of the X10 TOG paper by Scheifler \&amp; Gettys.}
}
</pre>
<h3>Common problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>The original documents specified a large number of field names,
but there are many common items that are not listed. A list of some
of the ones people have added are below.</li>
<li>When using BibTeX, the interaction between names and accenting
is somewhat tricky. You should use `G{\"o}del' or `G{\"{o}}del',
and not `{G{\"{o}}del}' or `{G\"{o}del}'.</li>
<li>The BibTeX program is written, as is all TeX, using static data
structures, and the maximum length of any one string is by default
1000 characters. It is not uncommon for fields like abstract and
contents to overflow this buffer. Solutions to this include 
<ul>
<li>change the source code to BibTeX (I've changed mine to
3000)</li>
<li>use <tt>\include{<i>file.tex</i>}</tt> to include an external
file</li>
<li>split the field into <i>field1</i>, <i>field2</i>,
...</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3>Format Description</h3>
<h3>Special features</h3>
The <tt>@STRING</tt> command is used to define abbreviations for
use by BibTeX. The command <tt>@string{jgg1 = "Journal of Gnats and
Gnus, Series~1"}</tt> defines 'jgg1' to be the abbreviation for the
string "Journal of Gnats and Gnus, Series~1". Any reference outside
of quotes or braces to <tt>jgg1</tt> will be filled in with the
full string. 
<p>The <tt>@PREAMBLE</tt> command is used to define formatter code
that will be output directly to the <tt>bbl</tt> file produced by
the BibTeX program. This usually consists of LaTeX macros. It is
unclear what one should do with the fields when converting to a
format that does not use TeX.</p>
<p>The <tt>@COMMENT</tt> command lets you put any text inside it.
It isn't really necessary, since BibTeX will ignore any text that
isn't inside an entry. However, you can not have an <b>@</b>
character outside of an item.</p>

<h3>Standard fields</h3>
For now I'm going to be lazy and give you what Oren Patashnik wrote
about the fields. I'll redo this sometime, including references to
how each field should be formatted. 
<dl>
<dt><tt>address</tt></dt>
<dd>Usually the address of the <tt>publisher</tt> or other type of
institution. For major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends
omitting the information entirely. For small publishers, on the
other hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete
address.</dd>
<dt><tt>annote</tt></dt>
<dd>An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography
styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
bibliography.</dd>
<dt><tt>author</tt></dt>
<dd>The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
LaTeX book.</dd>
<dt><tt>booktitle</tt></dt>
<dd>Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX
book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the
<tt>title</tt> field instead.</dd>
<dt><tt>chapter</tt></dt>
<dd>A chapter (or section or whatever) number.</dd>
<dt><tt>crossref</tt></dt>
<dd>The database key of the entry being cross referenced. Any
fields that are missing from the current record are inherited from
the field being cross referenced.</dd>
<dt><tt>edition</tt></dt>
<dd>The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be
an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown
here; the standard styles convert to lower case when
necessary.</dd>
<dt><tt>editor</tt></dt>
<dd>Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If
there is also an <tt>author</tt> field, then the <tt>editor</tt>
field gives the editor of the book or collection in which the
reference appears.</dd>
<dt><tt>howpublished</tt></dt>
<dd>How something strange has been published. The first word should
be capitalized.</dd>
<dt><tt>institution</tt></dt>
<dd>The sponsoring institution of a technical report.</dd>
<dt><tt>journal</tt></dt>
<dd>A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many
journals.</dd>
<dt><tt>key</tt></dt>
<dd>Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
when the ``author'' information <!-- See odds-and-ends -->
 is missing. This field should not be confused with the key that
appears in the <tt>cite</tt> command and at the beginning of the
database entry.</dd>
<dt><tt>month</tt></dt>
<dd>The month in which the work was published or, for an
unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the
standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3
of the LaTeX book.</dd>
<dt><tt>note</tt></dt>
<dd>Any additional information that can help the reader. The first
word should be capitalized.</dd>
<dt><tt>number</tt></dt>
<dd>The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
identified by its volume and number; the organization that issues a
technical report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are
given numbers in a named series.</dd>
<dt><tt>organization</tt></dt>
<dd>The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a
<tt>manual</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>pages</tt></dt>
<dd>One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as
<tt>42--111</tt> or <tt>7,41,73--97</tt> or <tt>43+</tt> (the
`<tt>+</tt>' in this last example indicates pages following that
don't form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain
<cite>Scribe</cite>-compatible databases, the standard styles
convert a single dash (as in <tt>7-33</tt>) to the double dash used
in TeX to denote number ranges (as in <tt>7--33</tt>).</dd>
<dt><tt>publisher</tt></dt>
<dd>The publisher's name.</dd>
<dt><tt>school</tt></dt>
<dd>The name of the school where a thesis was written.</dd>
<dt><tt>series</tt></dt>
<dd>The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire
book, the the <tt>title</tt> field gives its title and an optional
<tt>series</tt> field gives the name of a series or multi-volume
set in which the book is published.</dd>
<dt><tt>title</tt></dt>
<dd>The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.</dd>
<dt><tt>type</tt></dt>
<dd>The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research
Note''.</dd>
<dt><tt>volume</tt></dt>
<dd>The volume of a journal or multi-volume book.</dd>
<dt><tt>year</tt></dt>
<dd>The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year
it was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such
as <tt>1984</tt>, although the standard styles can handle any
<tt>year</tt> whose last four nonpunctuation characters are
numerals, such as `\hbox{(about 1984)}'.</dd></dl>
<h3>Other fields</h3>

<h3>LaTeX / BibTeX</h3>

<p>LaTeX/BibTeX is the de facto standard for publications in several fields
of the "hard sciences" (physics, mathematics, computer science and
engineering). BibTeX is citation formating and a text bibliographic database
tool. Its database format for bibliographical references is used in or is
able to be imported and exported by most other bibliographic tools.. For some
info see <a
href="http://bib2web.djvuzone.org/bibtex.html">http://bib2web.djvuzone.org/bibtex.html</a></p>

<p>It has many bibliographic style macros that format citations to many
different style specifications. BibTeX styles definition files are small
programs written in an un-named programing language [FORTH like]. Bibtex is
the bibliographic subsystem it provides the widely used  BibTeX bibliographic
database format which looks like this -</p>

<h3>Endnotes</h3>

<p>A very popular and widely used Bibliographic package. Recommended by many
Universities.</p>

<p>Platform: Windows, Mac</p>

<p>Description: Integrates three key bibliographical tasks within the one
package: the searching of remote bibliographical databases on the Internet;
the organisation of references in a database, and the creation of
bibliographies. EndNote can be fully integrated with Word and other Windows
word-processing software. Documents can be scanned and shorthand citations
expanded and complete bibliographies created. EndNote libraries created on
different platforms are compatible with each other. Home Page <a
href="http://www.endnote.com/">http://www.endnote.com</a></p>

<h2>Linux</h2>

<h3>Sixpack</h3>

<p>Sixpack is a graphical and command-line bibliography database manager
written in Perl/Tk. It interacts with the supplied package 'bp', (see below)
which can import and export from a number of formats including bibtex,
endnote, medline, procite, and many others. It can download references
directly off the Web, and open articles using external viewers. It can also
interface with Emacs/XEmacs and Lyx [LaTeX with a GUI interface] . It also
has instructions on how to interact with OpenOfiice / StarOffice using cvs
files and database import functions [I have used this]. Home Page - <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sixpack">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sixpack</a></p>

<h3>bp</h3>

<p>bp is a Perl library that is designed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Let you quickly make tools to access bibliographies</li>
  <li>Let you quickly make tools to access bibliographies</li>
  <li>Let you access multiple bibliography formats transparently</li>
  <li>Let you convert between formats</li>
  <li>Let you convert between character sets</li>
</ul>

<p>Developer - My first goal when designing the package was only the first --
I had written a number of tools that accessed my BibTeX bibliographies, and I
saw that I was reusing a lot of code. So I decided to make a generic package
to access BibTeX bibliographies. About a year later I decided that it would
be even better if the package could read multiple formats, and convert
between them. The result is bp. Parts of the package are still missing
(namely documentation, automatic format recognition, and a good set of
utilities), but everything needed for a working system exists. Home Page - <a

<h3>gBib</h3>

<p><i>gB</i>ib is a user-friendly Gnome BibTeX database browser and editor.
It provides facilities for merging BibTeX files, managing key conflicts, and
adding bibliographic citations in LyX. Home Page - <a
href="http://gbib.seul.org/">http://gbib.seul.org</a></p>

<h3>Pybliographer</h3>

<p>Pybliographer is a tool for managing bibliographic databases. The
application is based written in Python and has a text-based and a GTK GUI
interface It supports several bibliography formats and can be used for
searching, editing, reformatting, etc.. Due to its nature, it can be extended
to many uses (generating HTML pages according to bibliographic searches,
etc). Pybliographer has a class library structure that could allow other
applications to make use of it's facilities. It might be possible to provide
a link from this program to insert citations into OpenOffice. There are only
a few citation styles defined so far. Home Page - <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/pybliographer">http://www.gnome.org/pybliographer</a></p>

<h3>Kaspaliste</h3>

<p>Kaspaliste is a literature and knowledge database. It handles all kinds of
books, articles, journals, web pages etc. But the database goes beyond simply
storing bibliographical information. There is the possibility to create
annotated links between pieces of information (like the content of a book
chapter) and to group the links in categories. It is based on KDE and uses
the Postgres relational database. It is a promising project but currently
does not have import or export functions other than a Bibtex export. There
are no links to other programs such as OpenOffice . <a

<h3>The Jurabib package</h3>

<p>Extended BibTeX citation support for the humanities and legal texts.
jurabib is a package for the LaTeX typesetting system and supports citations
used in the humanities and by German law students. This package enables
automated citation with BIBTEX for legal studies and the humanities. In
addition, the package provides commands for specifying editors in a
commentary in a convenient way. Simplified formatting of the citation as well
as the bibliography entry is also provided. It is possible to display the
(short) title of a work only if an authors is cited with multiple works.
Giving a full citation in the text, conforming to the bibliography entry, is
supported. Several options are provided which might be of special interest
for those outside legal studies--for instance, displaying multiple full
citations. In addition, the format of last names and first names of authors
may be changed easily. Cross references to other footnotes are possible.
Language dependent handling of bibliography entries is possible by the
special language field. Home Page <a

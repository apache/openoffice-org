<h3 align="center">Oren Patashnik</h3>
<h3 align="center">February 8, 1988</h3>
<p align="justify"><b>1. Overview</b></p>
<p align="justify">[This document will be expanded when BibTeX
version 1.00 comes out. Please report typos, omissions,
inaccuracies, and especially unclear explanations to me
(patashnik@SCORE.STANFORD.EDU). Suggestions for improvements are
wanted and welcome.]</p>
<p align="justify">This documentation, for BibTeX version 0.99b, is
meant for general BibTeX users; bibliography-style designers should
read this document and then read &ldquo;Designing BibTeX
Styles&rdquo;&nbsp;[3], which is meant for just them.</p>
<p align="justify">This document has three parts: Section&nbsp;2
describes the differences between versions 0.98i and 0.99b of
BibTeX and between the corresponding versions of the standard
styles; Section&nbsp;3 updates Appendix&nbsp;B.2 of the L
"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X book&nbsp;[2]; and Section&nbsp;4
gives some general and specific tips that aren&rsquo;t documented
elsewhere. It&rsquo;s assumed throughout that you&rsquo;re familiar
with the relevant sections of the L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
T<sub>E</sub>X book.</p>
<p align="justify">This documentation also serves as sample input
to help BibTeX implementors get it running. For most documents,
this one included, you produce the reference list by: running L
"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X on the document (to produce the
aux file(s)), then running BibTeX (to produce the bbl file), then L
"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X twice more (first to find the
information in the <font face="Courier">bbl file and then to get
the forward references correct). In very rare circumstances you may
need an extra BibTeX/L "1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X
run.</font></p>
<p align="justify">BibTeX version 0.99b should be used with L
"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X version 2.09, for which the
closed bibliography format is the default; to get the open format,
use the optional document style openbib (in an open format
there&rsquo;s a line break between major blocks of a reference-list
entry; in a closed format the blocks run together).]</p>
<p align="justify">Note: BibTeX 0.99b is not compatible with the
old style files; nor is BibTeX 0.98i compatible with the new ones
(the new BibTeX, however, is compatible with old database
files).</p>
<p align="justify">Note for implementors: BibTeX provides
logical-area names TEXINPUTS: for bibliography-style files and
<font face="Courier">TEXBIB: for database files it can&rsquo;t
otherwise find.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b>2. Changes</b></p>
<p align="justify">This section describes the differences between
BibTeX versions 0.98i and 0.99b, and also between the corresponding
standard styles. There were a lot of differences; there will be a
lot fewer between 0.99 and 1.00.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>2.1 New BibTeX features</b></p>
<p align="justify">The following list explains BibTeX&rsquo;s new
features and how to use them.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p align="justify">1. With the single command
&lsquo;\nocite{*}&rsquo; you can now include in the reference list
every entry in the database files, without having to explicitly
\cite or \nocite each entry. Giving this command, in essence,
\nocites all the enties in the database, in database order, at the
very spot in your document where you give the command.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">2. You can now have as a field value (or an
@STRING definition) the concatenation of several strings. For
example if you&rsquo;ve defined</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">@STRING( WGA = " World Gnus Almanac" )</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">then it&rsquo;s easy to produce nearly-identical
title fields for different entries:</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"2"&gt;@BOOK(almanac-66,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">title = 1966 # WGA,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">. . .</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"2"&gt;@BOOK(almanac-67,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">title = 1967 # WGA,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">and so on. Or, you could have a field
like</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">month = "1~" # jan,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">which would come out something like
&lsquo;1~January&rsquo; or &lsquo;1~Jan.&rsquo; in the bbl file,
depending on how your bibliography style defines the
      <font face="Courier">jan abbreviation. You may concatenate as
      many strings as you like (except that there&rsquo;s a limit
      to the overall length of the resulting field); just be sure
      to put the concatenation character &lsquo;<font face=
      "Courier">#&rsquo;, surrounded by optional spaces or
      newlines, between each successive pair of
      strings.</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">3. BibTeX has a new cross-referencing feature,
explained by an example. Suppose you say \cite{no-gnats} in your
document, and suppose you have these two entries in your database
file:</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"2"&gt;@INPROCEEDINGS(no-gnats,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">crossref = "gg-proceedings",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "Rocky Gneisser",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">title = "No Gnats Are Taken for
Granite",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">pages = "133-139")</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">. . .</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"2"&gt;@PROCEEDINGS(gg-proceedings,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">editor = "Gerald Ford and Jimmy
Carter",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">title = "The Gnats and Gnus 1988
Proceedings",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">booktitle = "The Gnats and Gnus 1988
Proceedings")</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">Two things happen. First, the special crossref
field tells BibTeXthat the no-gnats entry should inherit any fields
it&rsquo;s missing from the entry it cross references,
gg-proceedings. In this case it in inherits the two fields editor
and booktitle. Note that, in the standard styles at least, the
booktitle field is irrelevant for the PROCEEDINGS entry type. The
booktitle field appears here in the gg-proceedings entry only so
that the entries that cross reference it may inherit the field. No
matter how many papers from this meeting exist in the database,
this booktitle field need only appear once.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">The second thing that happens: BibTeX
automatically puts the entry <font face="Courier">gg-proceedings
into the reference list if it&rsquo;s cross referenced by two or
more entries that you \cite or <font face="Courier">\nocite, even
if you don&rsquo;t <font face="Courier">\cite or \nocite the
gg-proceedings entry itself. So gg-proceedings will automatically
appear on the reference list if one other entry besides no-gnats
cross references it.</font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">To guarantee that this scheme works, however, a
cross-referenced entry must occur later in the database files than
every entry that cross-references it. Thus, putting all
cross-referenced entries at the end makes sense. (Moreover, you may
not reliably nest cross references; that is, a cross-referenced
entry may not itself reliably cross reference an entry. This is
almost certainly not something you&rsquo;d want to do,
though.)</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">One final note: This cross-referencing feature
is completely unrelated to the old BibTeX&rsquo;s cross
referencing, which is still allowed. Thus, having a field
like</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">note = "Jones \cite{jones-proof} improves the
result"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">is not affected by the new feature.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">4. BibTeX now handles accented characters. For
example if you have an entry with the two fields</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "Kurt G{\"o}del",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">year = 1931,</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">and if you&rsquo;re using the alpha bibliography
style, then BibTeX will construct the label [G&ouml;d31] for this
entry, which is what you&rsquo;d want. To get this feature to work
you must place the entire accented character in braces; in this
case either {\"o} or <font face="Courier">{\"{o}} will do.
Furthermore these braces must not themselves be enclosed in braces
(other than the ones that might delimit the entire field or the
entire entry); and there must be a backslash as the very first
character inside the braces. Thus neither <font face=
"Courier">{G{\"{o}}del} nor <font face="Courier">{G\"{o}del} will
work for this example.</font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">This feature handles all the accented characters
and all but the nonbackslashed foreign symbols found in Tables 3.1
and&nbsp;3.2 of the "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
"3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X book. This feature behaves similarly for
&ldquo;accents&rdquo; you might define; we&rsquo;ll see an example
shortly. For the purposes of counting letters in labels, BibTeX
considers everything contained inside the braces as a single
letter.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">5. BibTeX also handles hyphenated names. For
example if you have an entry with</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "Jean-Paul Sartre",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">and if you&rsquo;re using the abbrv style, then
the result is &lsquo;J.-P. Sartre&rsquo;.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">6. There&rsquo;s now an @PREAMBLE command for
the database files. This command&rsquo;s syntax is just like
<font face="Courier">@STRING&rsquo;s, except that there is no name
or equals-sign, just the string. Here&rsquo;s an
example:</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">@PREAMBLE{ "\newcommand{\noopsort}[1]{}
"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"># "\newcommand{\singleletter}[1]{#1} "
}</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">(note the use of concatenation here, too). The
standard styles output whatever information you give this command
(L "1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X macros most likely) directly
to the bbl file. We&rsquo;ll look at one possible use of this
command, based on the \noopsort command just defined.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">The issue here is sorting (alphabetizing).
BibTeX does a pretty good job, but occasionally weird circumstances
conspire to confuse BibTeX: Suppose that you have entries in your
database for the two books in a two-volume set by the same author,
and that you&rsquo;d like volume&nbsp;1 to appear just before
volume&nbsp;2 in your reference list. Further suppose that
there&rsquo;s now a second edition of volume&nbsp;1, which came out
in 1973, say, but that there&rsquo;s still just one edition of
volume&nbsp;2, which came out in 1971. Since the plain standard
style sorts by author and then year, it will place volume&nbsp;2
first (because its edition came out two years earlier) unless you
help BibTeX. You can do this by using the year fields below for the
two volumes:</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">year = "{\noopsort{a}}1973"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">. . .</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">year = "{\noopsort{b}}1971"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">According to the definition of \noopsort,
"3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> "3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X will print
nothing but the true year for these fields. But BibTeX will be
perfectly happy pretending that \noopsort specifies some fancy
accent that&rsquo;s supposed to adorn the &lsquo;a&rsquo; and
the&nbsp;&lsquo;b&rsquo;; thus when BibTeX sorts it will pretend
that &lsquo;a1973&rsquo; and &lsquo;b1971&rsquo; are the real
years, and since &lsquo;a&rsquo; comes before&nbsp;&lsquo;b&rsquo;,
it will place volume&nbsp;1 before volume&nbsp;2, just what you
wanted. By the way, if this author has any other works included in
your database, you&rsquo;d probably want to use instead something
like {\noopsort{1968a}}1973 and {\noopsort{1968b}}1971, so that
these two books would come out in a reasonable spot relative to the
author&rsquo;s other works (this assumes that 1968 results in a
reasonable spot, say because that&rsquo;s when the first edition of
volume&nbsp;1 appeared).</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">There is a limit to the number of @PREAMBLE
commands you may use, but you&rsquo;ll never exceed this limit if
you restrict yourself to one per database file; this is not a
serious restriction, given the concatenation feature
(item&nbsp;2).</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">7. BibTeX&rsquo;s sorting algorithm is now
stable. This means that if two entries have identical sort keys,
those two entries will appear in citation order. (The bibliography
styles construct these sort keys&mdash;usually the author
information followed by the year and the title.)</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">8. BibTeX no longer does case conversion for
file names; this will make BibTeX easier to install on Unix
systems, for example.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">9. It&rsquo;s now easier to add code for
processing a command-line <font face="Courier">aux-file
name.</font></p></dd></dl>
<p align="justify"><b>2.2 Changes to the standard styles</b></p>
<p align="justify">This section describes changes to the standard
styles (plain, unsrt, <font face="Courier">alpha, abbrv) that
affect ordinary users. Changes that affect style designers appear
in the document &ldquo;Designing BibTeX
Styles&rdquo;&nbsp;[3].</font></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p align="justify">1. In general, sorting is now by
&ldquo;author&rdquo;, then year, then title&mdash;the old versions
didn&rsquo;t use the year field. (The <font face="Courier">alpha
style, however, sorts first by label, then &ldquo;author&rdquo;,
year, and title.) The quotes around author mean that some entry
types might use something besides the author, like the editor or
organization.</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">2. Many unnecessary ties (~) have been removed.
L "1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X thus will produce slightly
fewer &lsquo;<font face="Courier">Underfull <font face=
"Courier">\hbox&rsquo; messages when it&rsquo;s formatting the
reference list.</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">3. Emphasizing (<font face="Courier">{\em ...})
has replaced italicizing ({\it ...}). This will almost never result
in a difference between the old output and the new.</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">4. The <font face="Courier">alpha style now uses
a superscripted&nbsp;&lsquo;<sub><img src=
"btxdoc_html_4f4e0c11.png" name="Graphic1" align="bottom" width="9"
     height="14" border="0"></sub>&rsquo; instead of
     a&nbsp;&lsquo;*&rsquo; to represent names omitted in
     constructing the label. If you really liked it the way it was,
     however, or if you want to omit the character entirely, you
     don&rsquo;t have to modify the style file&mdash;you can
     override the&nbsp;&lsquo;<sub><img src=
     "btxdoc_html_4f4e0c11.png" name="Graphic2" align="bottom"
     width="9" height="14" border="0"></sub>&rsquo; by redefining
     the <font face="Courier">\etalchar command that the
      <font face="Courier">alpha style writes onto the <font face=
      "Courier">bbl file (just preceding the <font face=
      "Courier">\thebibliography environment); use L
      "1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> T<sub>E</sub>X&rsquo;s <font face=
      "Courier">\renewcommand inside a database <font face=
      "Courier">@PREAMBLE command, described in the previous
      subsection&rsquo;s
      item&nbsp;6.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">5. The <font face="Courier">abbrv style now uses
&lsquo;Mar.&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sept.&rsquo;for those months rather
than &lsquo;March&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sep.&rsquo;</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">6. The standard styles use BibTeX&rsquo;s new
cross-referencing feature by giving a \cite of the cross-referenced
entry and by omitting from the cross-referencing entry (most of
the) information that appears in the cross-referenced entry. These
styles do this when a titled thing (the cross-referencing entry) is
part of a larger titled thing (the cross-referenced entry). There
are five such situations: when (1)&nbsp;an INPROCEEDINGS (or
CONFERENCE, which is the same) cross references a <font face=
"Courier">PROCEEDINGS; when (2)&nbsp;a <font face="Courier">BOOK,
(3)&nbsp;an <font face="Courier">INBOOK, or (4)&nbsp;an
      <font face="Courier">INCOLLECTION cross references a
      <font face="Courier">BOOK (in these cases, the
      cross-referencing entry is a single volume in a multi-volume
      work); and when (5)&nbsp;an ARTICLE cross references an
      ARTICLE (in this case, the cross-referenced entry is really a
      journal, but there&rsquo;s no JOURNAL entry type; this will
      result in warning messages about an empty author and
      <font face="Courier">title for the journal&mdash;you should
      just ignore these
      warnings).</font></font></font></font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">7. The <font face="Courier">MASTERSTHESIS and
<font face="Courier">PHDTHESIS entry types now take an optional
type field. For example you can get the standard styles to call
your reference a &lsquo;Ph.D. dissertation&rsquo; instead of the
default &lsquo;PhD thesis&rsquo; by including
a</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">type = "{Ph.D.} dissertation"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">in your database entry.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">8. Similarly, the INBOOK and <font face=
"Courier">INCOLLECTION entry types now take an optional type field,
allowing &lsquo;section&nbsp;1.2&rsquo; instead of the default
&lsquo;chapter&nbsp;1.2&rsquo;. You get this by
putting</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">chapter = "1.2",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">type = "Section"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">in your database entry.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">9. The <font face="Courier">BOOKLET,
      <font face="Courier">MASTERSTHESIS, and <font face=
      "Courier">TECHREPORT entry types now format their title
      fields as if they were ARTICLE <font face="Courier">titles
      rather than <font face="Courier">BOOK <font face=
      "Courier">titles.</font></font></font></font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">10. The <font face="Courier">PROCEEDINGS and
<font face="Courier">INPROCEEDINGS entry types now use the address
field to tell where a conference was held, rather than to give the
address of the publisher or organization. If you want to include
the publisher&rsquo;s or organization&rsquo;s address, put it in
the publisher or <font face="Courier">organization
field.</font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">11. The <font face="Courier">BOOK, INBOOK,
INCOLLECTION, and <font face="Courier">PROCEEDINGS entry types now
allow either volume or <font face="Courier">number (but not both),
rather than just volume.</font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">12. The <font face="Courier">INCOLLECTION entry
type now allows a series and an <font face="Courier">edition
field.</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">13. The <font face="Courier">INPROCEEDINGS and
<font face="Courier">PROCEEDINGS entry types now allow either a
volume or <font face="Courier">number, and also a <font face=
"Courier">series field.</font></font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">14. The <font face="Courier">UNPUBLISHED entry
type now outputs, in one block, the note field followed by the date
information.</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">15. The <font face="Courier">MANUAL entry type
now prints out the organization in the first block if the author
field is empty.</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">16. The <font face="Courier">MISC entry type now
issues a warning if all the optional fields are empty (that is, if
the entire entry is empty).</font></p></dd></dl>
<p align="justify"><b>3. The Entries</b></p>
<p align="justify">This section is simply a corrected version of
Appendix&nbsp;B.2 of the "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
"3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X book&nbsp;[2], <font face=
"Symbol">&Oacute;&nbsp;1986, by Addison-Wesley. The basic scheme is
the same, only a few details have changed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><b>3.1 Entry Types</b></p>
<p align="justify">When entering a reference in the database, the
first thing to decide is what type of entry it is. No fixed
classification scheme can be complete, but BibTeX provides enough
entry types to handle almost any reference reasonably well.</p>
<p align="justify">References to different types of publications
contain different information; a reference to a journal article
might include the volume and number of the journal, which is
usually not meaningful for a book. Therefore, database entries of
different types have different fields. For each entry type, the
fields are divided into three classes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>required</b> Omitting the field will produce
a warning message and, rarely, a badly formatted bibliography
entry. If the required information is not meaningful, you are using
the wrong entry type. However, if the required information is
meaningful but, say, already included is some other field, simply
ignore the warning.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>optional</b> The field&rsquo;s information
will be used if present, but can be omitted without causing any
formatting problems. You should include the optional field if it
will help the reader.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>ignored</b> The field is ignored. BibTeX
ignores any field that is not required or optional, so you can
include any fields you want in a <font face="Courier">bib file
entry. It&rsquo;s a good idea to put all relevant information about
a reference in its <font face="Courier">bib file entry&mdash;even
information that may never appear in the bibliography. For example,
if you want to keep an abstract of a paper in a computer file, put
it in an abstract field in the paper&rsquo;s bib file entry. The
bib file is likely to be as good a place as any for the abstract,
and it is possible to design a bibliography style for printing
selected abstracts. Note: Misspelling a field name will result in
its being ignored, so watch out for typos (especially for optional
fields, since BibTeX won&rsquo;t warn you when those are
missing).</font></font></p></dd></dl>
<p align="justify">The following are the standard entry types,
along with their required and optional fields, that are used by the
standard bibliography styles. The fields within each class
(required or optional) are listed in order of occurrence in the
output, except that a few entry types may perturb the order
slightly, depending on what fields are missing. These entry types
are similar to those adapted by Brian Reid from the classification
scheme of van&nbsp;Leunen&nbsp;[4] for use in the <i>Scribe</i>
system. The meanings of the individual fields are explained in the
next section. Some nonstandard bibliography styles may ignore some
optional fields in creating the reference. Remember that, when used
in the bib file, the entry-type name is preceded by an @
character.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>article</b> An article from a journal or

<p align="justify">In addition to the fields listed above, each
entry type also has an optional <font face="Courier">key field,
used in some styles for alphabetizing, for cross referencing, or
for forming a <font face="Courier">\bibitem label. You should
include a key field for any entry whose &ldquo;author&rdquo;
information is missing; the &ldquo;author&rdquo; information is
usually the <font face="Courier">author field, but for some entry
types it can be the editor or even the organization field
(Section&nbsp;4 describes this in more detail). Do not confuse the
key field with the key that appears in the \cite command and at the
beginning of the database entry; this field is named
&ldquo;key&rdquo; only for compatibility with
<i>Scribe</i>.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify"><b>3.2 Fields</b></p>
<p align="justify">Below is a description of all fields recognized
by the standard bibliography styles. An entry can also contain
other fields, which are ignored by those styles.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>address</b> Usually the address of the
publisher or other type of institution. For major publishing
houses, van&nbsp;Leunen recommends omitting the information
entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand, you can help the
reader by giving the complete address.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>annote</b> An annotation. It is not used by
the standard bibliography styles, but may be used by others that
produce an annotated bibliography.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>author</b> The name(s) of the author(s), in
the format described in the "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
"3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X book.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>booktitle</b> Title of a book, part of which
is being cited. See the "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
"3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X book for how to type titles. For book
entries, use the title field instead.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>chapter</b> A chapter (or section or
whatever) number.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>crossref</b> The database key of the entry
being cross referenced.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>edition</b> The edition of a book&mdash;for
example, &ldquo;Second&rdquo;. This should be an ordinal, and
should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here; the
standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>editor</b> Name(s) of editor(s), typed as
indicated in the "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> "3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X
book. If there is also an author field, then the editor field gives
the editor of the book or collection in which the reference
appears.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>howpublished</b> How something strange has
been published. The first word should be capitalized.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>institution</b> The sponsoring institution of
a technical report.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>journal</b> A journal name. Abbreviations are
provided for many journals; see the <i>Local Guide</i>.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>key</b> Used for alphabetizing, cross
referencing, and creating a label when the &ldquo;author&rdquo;
information (described in Section&nbsp;4) is missing. This field
should not be confused with the key that appears in the \cite
command and at the beginning of the database entry.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>month</b> The month in which the work was
published or, for an unpublished work, in which it was written. You
should use the standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in
Appendix B.1.3 of the "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
"3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X book.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>note</b> Any additional information that can
help the reader. The first word should be capitalized.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>number</b> The number of a journal, magazine,
technical report, or of a work in a series. An issue of a journal
or magazine is usually identified by its volume and number; the
organization that issues a technical report usually gives it a
number; and sometimes books are given numbers in a named
series.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>organization</b> The organization that
sponsors a conference or that publishes a manual.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>pages</b> One or more page numbers or range
of numbers, such as <font face="Courier">42&ndash;111 or
      <font face="Courier">7,41,73&ndash;97 or <font face=
      "Courier">43+ (the &lsquo;<font face="Courier">+&rsquo; in
      this last example indicates pages following that don&rsquo;t
      form a simple range). To make it easier to maintain
      <i>Scribe</i>-compatible databases, the standard styles
      convert a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in
      T<sub>E</sub>X to denote number ranges (as in <font face=
      "Courier">7&ndash;33).</font></font></font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>publisher</b> The publisher&rsquo;s
name.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>school</b> The name of the school where a
thesis was written.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>series</b> The name of a series or set of
books. When citing an entire book, the the title field gives its
title and an optional series field gives the name of a series or
multi-volume set in which the book is published.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>title</b> The work&rsquo;s title, typed as
explained in the L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> T<sub>E</sub>X book.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>type</b> The type of a technical
report&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Research Note&rdquo;.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>volume</b> The volume of a journal or
multivolume book.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify"><b>year</b> The year of publication or, for an
unpublished work, the year it was written. Generally it should
consist of four numerals, such as 1984, although the standard
styles can handle any year whose last four nonpunctuation
characters are numerals, such as &lsquo;(about
1984)&rsquo;.</p></dd></dl>
<p align="justify"><b>4. Helpful Hints</b></p>
<p align="justify">This section gives some random tips that
aren&rsquo;t documented elsewhere, at least not in this detail.
They are, roughly, in order of least esoteric to most. First,
however, a brief spiel.</p>
<p align="justify">I understand that there&rsquo;s often little
choice in choosing a bibliography
style&mdash;journal&nbsp;<sub><img src="btxdoc_html_m6b4cff24.png"
name="Graphic3" align="bottom" width="33" height="12" border=
"0"></sub> says you must use style&nbsp;<sub><img src=
"btxdoc_html_7359fea5.png" name="Graphic4" align="bottom"
     width="32" height="12" border="0"></sub> and that&rsquo;s
     that. If you have a choice, however, I strongly recommend that
     you choose something like the <font face="Courier">plain
     standard style. Such a style, van&nbsp;Leunen&nbsp;[4] argues
     convincingly, encourages better writing than the
     alternatives&mdash;more concrete, more vivid.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><i>The Chicago Manual of Style</i>&nbsp;[1], on
the other hand, espouse the author-date system, in which the
citation might appear in the text as &lsquo;(Jones, 1986)&rsquo;. I
argue that this system, besides cluttering up the text with
information that may or may not be relevant, encourages the passive
voice and vague writing. Furthermore the strongest arguments for
using the author-date system&mdash;like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the most
practical&rdquo;&mdash;fall flat on their face with the advent of
computer-typesetting technology. For instance the <i>Chicago
Manual</i> contains, right in the middle of page&nbsp;401, this
anachronism: &ldquo;The chief disadvantage of [a style like plain]
is that additions or deletions cannot be made after the manuscript
is typed without changing numbers in both text references and
list.&rdquo; "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> "3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X,
obviously, sidesteps the disadvantage.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, the logical deficiencies of the
author-date style are quite evident once you&rsquo;ve written a
program to implement it. For example, in a large bibliography,
using the standard alphabetizing scheme, the entry for &lsquo;(Aho
et&nbsp;al., 1983b)&rsquo; might be half a page later than the one
for &lsquo;(Aho et&nbsp;al., 1983a)&rsquo;. Fixing this problem
results in even worse ones. What a mess. (I have, unfortunately,
programmed such a style, and if you&rsquo;re saddled with an
unenlightened publisher or if you don&rsquo;t buy my propaganda,
it&rsquo;s available from the Rochester style collection.)</p>
<p align="justify">Ok, so the spiel wasn&rsquo;t very brief; but it
made me feel better, and now my blood pressure is back to normal.
Here are the tips for using BibTeXwith the standard styles
(although many of them hold for nonstandard styles, too).</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p align="justify">1. With BibTeX&rsquo;s style-designing language
you can program general database manipulations, in addition to
bibliography styles. For example it&rsquo;s a fairly easy task for
someone familiar with the language to produce a database-key/author
index of all the entries in a database. Consult the <i>Local
Guide</i> to see what tools are available on your system.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">2. The standard style&rsquo;s thirteen entry
types do reasonably well at formatting most entries, but no scheme
with just thirteen formats can do everything perfectly. Thus, you
should feel free to be creative in how you use these entry types
(but if you have to be too creative, there&rsquo;s a good chance
you&rsquo;re using the wrong entry type).</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">3. Don&rsquo;t take the field names too
seriously. Sometimes, for instance, you might have to include the
publisher&rsquo;s address along with the publisher&rsquo;s name in
the publisher field, rather than putting it in the
      <font face="Courier">address field. Or sometimes, difficult
      entries work best when you make judicious use of the
      <font face="Courier">note field.</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">4. Don&rsquo;t take the warning messages too
seriously. Sometimes, for instance, the year appears in the title,
as in <i>The 1966 World Gnus Almanac</i>. In this case it&rsquo;s
best to omit the year field and to ignore BibTeX&rsquo;s warning
message.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">5. If you have too many names to list in an
author or <font face="Courier">editor field, you can end the list
with &ldquo;and others&rdquo;; the standard styles appropriately
append an &ldquo;et&nbsp;al.&rdquo;</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">6. In general, if you want to keep BibTeX from
changing something to lower case, you enclose it in braces. You
might not get the effect you want, however, if the very first
character after the left brace is a backslash. The &ldquo;special
characters&rdquo; item later in this section explains.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">7. For <i>Scribe</i> compatibility, the database
files allow an <font face="Courier">@COMMENT command; it&rsquo;s
not really needed because BibTeX allows in the database files any
comment that&rsquo;s not within an entry. If you want to comment
out an entry, simply remove the &lsquo;<font face=
"Courier">@&rsquo; character preceding the entry
type.</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">8. The standard styles have journal
abbreviations that are computer-science oriented; these are in the
style files primarily for the example. If you have a different set
of journal abbreviations, it&rsquo;s sensible to put them in
@STRING commands in their own database file and to list this
database file as an argument to L
"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X&rsquo;s \bibliography command
(but you should list this argument before the ones that specify
real database entries).</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">9. It&rsquo;s best to use the three-letter
abbreviations for the month, rather than spelling out the month
yourself. This lets the bibliography style be consistent. And if
you want to include information for the day of the month, the month
field is usually the best place. For example</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">month = jul # "~4,"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">will probably produce just what you
want.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">10. If you&rsquo;re using the unsrt style
(references are listed in order of citation) along with the
<font face="Courier">\nocite{*} feature (all entries in the
database are included), the placement of the <font face=
"Courier">\nocite{*} command within your document file will
determine the reference order. According to the rule given in
Section&nbsp;2.1: If the command is placed at the beginning of the
document, the entries will be listed in exactly the order they
occur in the database; if it&rsquo;s placed at the end, the entries
that you explicitly \cite or \nocite will occur in citation order,
and the remaining database entries will be in database
order.</font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">11. For theses, van Leunen recommends not giving
the school&rsquo;s department after the name of the degree, since
schools, not departments, issue degrees. If you really think that
giving the department information will help the reader find the
thesis, put that information in the address field.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">12. The <font face="Courier">MASTERSTHESIS and
<font face="Courier">PHDTHESIS entry types are so named for
<i>Scribe</i> compatibility; <font face="Courier">MINORTHESIS and
<font face="Courier">MAJORTHESIS probably would have been better
names. Keep this in mind when trying to classify a non-U.S.
thesis.</font></font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">13. Here&rsquo;s yet another suggestion for what
to do when an author&rsquo;s name appears slightly differently in
two publications. Suppose, for example, two journals articles use
these fields.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "Donald E. Knuth"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">. . .</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "D. E. Knuth"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">There are two possibilities. You could
(1)&nbsp;simply leave them as is, or (2)&nbsp;assuming you know for
sure that these authors are one and the same person, you could list
both in the form that the author prefers (say,
&lsquo;Donald&nbsp;E. Knuth&rsquo;). In the first case, the entries
might be alphabetized incorrectly, and in the second, the slightly
altered name might foul up somebody&rsquo;s electronic library
search. But there&rsquo;s a third possibility, which is the one I
prefer. You could convert the second journal&rsquo;s field
to</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "D[onald] E. Knuth"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">This avoids the pitfalls of the previous two
solutions, since BibTeX alphabetizes this as if the brackets
weren&rsquo;t there, and since the brackets clue the reader in that
a full first name was missing from the original. Of course it
introduces another pitfall&mdash;&lsquo;D[onald]&nbsp;E.
Knuth&rsquo; looks ugly&mdash;but in this case I think the increase
in accuracy outweighs the loss in aesthetics.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">14. "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup>
"3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X&rsquo;s comment character &lsquo;%&rsquo; is
not a comment character in the database files.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">15. Here&rsquo;s a more complete description of
the &ldquo;author&rdquo; information referred to in previous
sections. For most entry types the &ldquo;author&rdquo; information
is simply the author field. However: For the BOOK and INBOOK entry
types it&rsquo;s the author field, but if there&rsquo;s no author
then it&rsquo;s the <font face="Courier">editor field; for the
<font face="Courier">MANUAL entry type it&rsquo;s the
      <font face="Courier">author field, but if there&rsquo;s no
      author then it&rsquo;s the organization field; and for the
      PROCEEDINGS entry type it&rsquo;s the editor field, but if
      there&rsquo;s no editor then it&rsquo;s the organization
      field.</font></font></font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">16. When creating a label, the alpha style uses
the &ldquo;author&rdquo; information described above, but with a
slight change&mdash;for the MANUAL and PROCEEDINGS entry types, the
key field takes precedence over the organization field.
Here&rsquo;s a situation where this is useful.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">organization = "The Association for Computing
Machinery",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">key = "ACM"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">Without the <font face="Courier">key field, the
alpha style would make a label from the first three letters of
information in the organization field; alpha knows to strip off the
&lsquo;The &rsquo;, but it would still form a label like
&lsquo;[Ass86]&rsquo;, which, however intriguing, is uninformative.
Including the key field, as above, would yield the better label
&lsquo;[ACM86]&rsquo;.</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">You won&rsquo;t always need the key field to
override the organization, though: With</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">organization = "Unilogic, Ltd.",</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">for instance, the alpha style would form the
perfectly reasonable label &lsquo;[Uni86]&rsquo;.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">17. Section&nbsp;2.1 discusses accented
characters. To BibTeX, an accented character is really a special
case of a &ldquo;special character&rdquo;, which consists of
everything from a left brace at the top-most level, immediately
followed by a backslash, up through the matching right brace. For
example in the field</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">author = "\AA{ke} {Jos{\'{e}} {\'{E}douard}
G{\"o}del"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">there are just two special characters,
&lsquo;{\'{E}douard}&rsquo; and &lsquo;{\"o}&rsquo; (the same would
be true if the pair of double quotes delimiting the field were
braces instead). In general, BibTeX will not do any processing of a
T<sub>E</sub>X or "3"&gt;L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> "3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X
control sequence inside a special character, but it <i>will</i>
process other characters. Thus a style that converts all titles to
lower case would convert</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">The {\TeX BOOK\NOOP} Experience</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">to</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">The {\TeX book\NOOP} experience</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">(the &lsquo;<font face="Courier">The&rsquo; is
still capitalized because it&rsquo;s the first word of the
title).</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">This special-character scheme is useful for
handling accented characters, for getting BibTeX&rsquo;s
alphabetizing to do what you want, and, since BibTeX counts an
entire special character as just one letter, for stuffing extra
characters inside labels. The file <font face="Courier">XAMPL.BIB
distributed with BibTeXgives examples of all three
uses.</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">18. This final item of the section describes
BibTeX&rsquo;s names (which appear in the author or
      <font face="Courier">editor field) in slightly more detail
      than what appears in Appendix&nbsp;B of the
      L"1"&gt;<sup>A</sup> T<sub>E</sub>X book. In what follows, a
      &ldquo;name&rdquo; corresponds to a person. (Recall that you
      separate multiple names in a single field with the word
      &ldquo;and&rdquo;, surrounded by spaces, and not enclosed in
      braces. This item concerns itself with the structure of a
      single name.)</font></p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">Each name consists of four parts: First, von,
Last, and&nbsp;Jr; each part consists of a (possibly empty) list of
name-tokens. The Last part will be nonempty if any part is, so if
there&rsquo;s just one token, it&rsquo;s always a Last
token.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">Recall that Per Brinch&nbsp;Hansen&rsquo;s name
should be typed</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"Brinch Hansen, Per"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">The First part of his name has the single token
&ldquo;Per&rdquo;; the Last part has two tokens,
&ldquo;Brinch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hansen&rdquo;; and the von and Jr
parts are empty. If you had typed</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"Per Brinch Hansen"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">instead, BibTeX would (erroneously) think
&ldquo;Brinch&rdquo; were a First-part token, just as
&ldquo;Paul&rdquo; is a First-part token in &ldquo;John&nbsp;Paul
Jones&rdquo;, so this erroneous form would have two First tokens
and one Last token.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">Here&rsquo;s another example:</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\'e}e
Poussin"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">This name has four tokens in the First part, two
in the von, and two in the Last. Here BibTeX knows where one part
ends and the other begins because the tokens in the von part begin
with lower-case letters.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">In general, it&rsquo;s a von token if the first
letter at brace-level&nbsp;0 is in lower case. Since technically
everything in a &ldquo;special character&rdquo; is at
brace-level&nbsp;0, you can trick BibTeX into thinking that a token
is or is not a von token by prepending a dummy special character
whose first letter past the "3"&gt;T<sub>E</sub>X control sequence
is in the desired case, upper or lower.</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">To summarize, BibTeX allows three possible forms
for the name:</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"First von Last"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"von Last, First"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">"von Last, Jr, First"</p></dd>
<dd>
<p align="justify">You may almost always use the first form; you
shouldn&rsquo;t if either there&rsquo;s a Jr part, or the Last part
has multiple tokens but there&rsquo;s no von part.</p></dd></dl>

<h3><a id="Vision" href="#Vision">Vision</a></h3>

<p>The OpenOffice Bibliographic project (OOoBib) will make it easier for people
to store and manage their reference data, to format their documents, and to
collaborate with other users.</p>

<p>It will be simple to use for the casual user, but will meet all the
requirements of the professional and academic writer.</p>

<p>The features we will build include -</p>
<ul>
  <li>A greatly improved Graphic User Interface for entering, editing and
    searching for bibliographic records.</li>
  <li>An improved bibliographic database (and internal data model) compatible
    with the emerging the industry standards, such as the "<a
    href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">Metadata Object Description
    Schema</a>" (MODS), and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">"Resource
    Description Framework"</a> (RDF), a framework for describing and
    interchanging metadata. These standards will support new collection types
    in different media, not just limited to books and journals but also
    supporting video, audio, maps, pictures etc.</li>
  <li><a href="XML-bibliography-proposal.pdf">Improved metadata support</a> in
    OpenOffice. Co-project leader Bruce D'Arcus has worked with <a
    href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office-metadata">OpenDocument
    - Metadata subcommittee</a> to improve metadata support on OpenOffice. The
    <a
    href="http://www.oasis-open.or g/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">OASIS
    OpenDocument Technical Committee</a> has approved these proposals, <a
    href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/24327/ODF-Metadata-Proposal.pdf">metadata
    support [pdf],</a> for inclusion in ODF 1.2. What do we mean by enhanced
    metadata support? We mean that you can: 
    <ul>
      <li>describe your document the way you want to describe it; no longer are
        you limited to a pre-selected list of properties</li>
      <li>describe different parts within your document: images, tables,
        paragraphs, and so forth</li>
      <li>tag pieces of document content as metadata; you can say this heading
        is a title, this fragment is the name of some person, and so forth</li>
      <li>create dynamic content fields based on this flexible metadata
      system</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For the first time, the opportunity for the creation and distribution of
    opensource bibliographic style definitions that are not specific to a
    particular word-processor or bibliographic package. We propose to implement
    Bibliographic table and citation formatting using a process called <a
    href="citeproc/index.html">CiteProc</a>. See <a
    href="http://www.silmaril.ie/bibliox/biblioxdoc.html">BiblioX</a> for
    technical discussion of this approach. This methodology is used in <a
    href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic_Software_and_Standards_Information#Zotero">Zotero</a>,
    the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/">Firefox</a> bibliographic
    plugin.</li>
  <li>The ability to support all the common styles and conventions for
    citations and reference tables. This will include support for footnote /
    endnote citation styles and for differing first and subsequent citation
    formats. Also <a
    href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Writer_enhancements_for_OOBib">enhancements</a>
    to Openoffice Writer Footnote/ Endnote location selection and headings.</li>
  <li>The ability to change a document from one <a
    href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Styles">style</a>
    to another with no or minimal further editing.</li>
  <li>Import and export filters for the common formats for bibliographic data,
    such as <a href="biblio-sw.html#LaTeX">BibTeX</a>, <a
    href="biblio-sw.html#Reference">RIS</a>, <a
    href="biblio-sw.html#Endnotes">EndNote</a>, <a
    href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/marc.html">MARC</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to connect to, and to exchange data with bibliographic
    databases, using <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> and <a
    href="biblio-sw.html">Z39.50 and SRU/W</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to query internet reference sources (e.g. reference databases
    and library catalogues) directly and to add the responses received to the
    bibliographic database.</li>
  <li>A note taking facility, with the ability to link notes to references,
    notes to other notes, notes to keywords; and a notes search ability.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the project's objectives are achieved, it will be possible to convert a
scientific, technical or academic paper from one bibliographic style to an
other bibliographic style, such as one required by a journal, simply by
selecting the required style convention and automaticity reformat the document
to the new style. So far as we know, the only WYSIWYG word processor that
provides these features is <a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic_Software_and_Standards_Information#Nota_Bene">Nota
Bene</a>, it is a good example of the type of Bibliographic and word processing
integration we would like to achieve with OpenOffice. </p>

<h3>1st Stage, Bibliographic Facility Redevelopment</h3>

<p>As our first step, we will implement the internal metadata and API
enhancements to enable Bibliographic extensions to OpenOffice such as <a
href="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>, to better interact with OpenOffice.
Currently when you insert citation into Writer with Zotero, only the text of
the formatted citation is stored in the Writer Document, all the citation
metadata resides in the database. If you wish to share your document with the
full bibliographic data you would need to package it with a copy of the Zotero
database. The aim is to store both formatted citation its metadata in the
Writer document. Zotero would be able to retrieve the bibliographic data from
the document and when necessary reformat the citations and references tables
from the original metadata.</p>

<p>To achieve this we will implement the most simple changes to the OOo Writer
core code (the API basic code, and UNO mappings, but not yet the user interface
code) necessary.</p>

<p>When these basic functions are built into OOo Writer and are made assessable
via UNO, we can then use rapid prototyping development methods to design and
build prototype GUI interfaces and bibliographic formatting engines using the
Extension Development Toolkit and Smart Tags. We will be able to use any of the
programming languages which have OpenOffice bindings and are supported by the
toolkit: C++, Java, Python and, of course, OpenOffice Basic. We believe that we
will find more developers who can work in these languages than by insisting on
C++ code from the start. Also it is much easier to build prototypes using Java,
Python and OpenOffice Basic than in C++. </p>

<p><strong>When will this wonderful facility be available ?</strong>
<strong><span style="color: #B2005A; background-color: #FFFFFF"><img alt="new"
src="new.gif" /> We have planned to get meta data support for text objects in
Writer in OOo version 3.1 (due April 2009). </span></strong><strong><span
style="color: #B2005A; background-color: #FFFFFF">See <a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Features#Planned_Features_for_2.x.2F3.0_Release">feature
timeline</a>. Also see a <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/GullFOSS/entry/what's_up_in_the_writer">blog</a> on
plans for Writer.</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>But what can I do now ?</strong> In the meantime, if you are not
happy with OOo's basic bibliographic support, you may like to use some of the
third-party bibliographic applications that can work with OpenOffice. See the
<a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Software_and_Standards_Information">bibliographic
software page</a> for more details. We recommend you use <a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Software_and_Standards_Information#Zotero">Zotero</a>,
which has a OOo plugin to assist with citation management. Other applications
are: <a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Software_and_Standards_Information#JabRef">Jabref,</a>
which can inset citations and bibliographies into an Writer document<img
alt="new" src="new.gif" />, <a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Software_and_Standards_Information#B3">B3</a>
which can write bibliographic records to a Openoffice Bibliographic text
database or <a
href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Bibliographic/Software_and_Standards_Information#Bibus">Bibus</a>
which has good integration with OpenOffice.</p>

<h3><a id="Background">Background</a></h3>

<p>The terminology used by bibliographic applications can be confusing, so we
have fixed upon the following three definitions:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>citation</strong><dd>a short description that points to a fuller
      description of an information source, or reference item elsewhere, either
      in a note or a reference list.</dd>
  </dt>
  <dt><strong>reference item</strong><dd>a fuller description of an information
      source; also called a bibliographic entry or item.</dd>
  </dt>
  <dt><strong>reference list</strong><dd>a collection of references; also
      called a bibliography.</dd>
  </dt>
</dl>

<p>Bibliographic applications help people manage their reference items and to
create formatted citations and reference lists. Publishers, academic and other
institutions generally specify detailed requirements of how their documents are
to look, including the reference lists and the citations. Citation and
reference list formatting is an often tedious and error-prone task,
particularly if one has to later change styles. An ideal bibliographic
application, then, allows a user to forget about these arcane details and focus
on writing.</p>

<p>The collection of bibliographic data (which includes author and publication
details) for works cited in a document can also be a tedious and time consuming
task and often involves the manual entry of these details into a database. An
ideal bibliographic application would simplify or automate this process.</p>

<p>Microsoft has only <a
href="http://netapps.muohio.edu/blogs/darcusb/darcusb/archives/category/citations/word-2007/">recently</a>
added bibliographic support to Word (version 2007) and the users of this
product have had to make use of third-party, and usually commercial
bibliographic applications, such as Endnotes and Reference Manager. Workers in
many academic and scientific fields have used Latex, and its variants for
technical word processing, and this software has its own bibliographic
component called 'Bibtext'. OpenOffice does provide basic bibliographic
functions, these include; a simple bibliographic database, a process to insert
in-text or endnote citations into a document and a bibliographic table
generator to produce a reference table of citations formatted as specified by
the user. However, considerable improvement is needed for OpenOffice to
approach or improve on the facilities provided by the commercial bibliographic
products.</p>

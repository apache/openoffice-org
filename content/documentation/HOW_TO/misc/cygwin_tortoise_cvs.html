<H3>Installing and using CVS under Windows</H3> 
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Credits: this HowTo is the result of the combined
efforts of the website.openoffice.org mailing-list members. This file is on the
OpenOffice.org server because of their collaboration. We hope that this
summary, and any improved or rewritten version in the future will help others
to enjoy CVS-ing and online HTML collaboration in as pleasurable and effective
a way as possible. It is not difficult at all. It is, in fact, extremely easy,
easier than ftp-ing. So if you can ftp, you will certainly be able to CVS using
the combined tools of Cygwin and TortoiseCVS. </FONT></B></P>

<P>Make sure you are connected to the Internet. </P> 
<P>Go to <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com" TARGET="_blank">www.cygwin.com</A> and
download the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> executable to your computer, the icon of which you will see on the
homepage somewhere. Remember the following:</P> 
<UL> 
<LI>this file simply administers the process of choosing which files to
download to your computer, the download process itself (if you are disconnected
from the Internet whilst you are downloading from a server which supports the
function, you will be able to carry on from where you left off when you
reconnect by simply clicking on setup again) and unzipping and installing once
everything has been downloaded. When you download the <B>Cygwin</B> <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE>, you will not yet have downloaded the <B>Cygwin</B> program. The
<B>Cygwin</B> <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> simply makes it possible for you to download the program files you need
in order to install <B>Cygwin</B> on your hard drive</LI> 
<LI>if you are disconnected whilst downloading the <B>Cygwin</B> files, when
you reconnect and restart the download process, you may think it is starting
from scratch as the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> file always reloads a file called <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.ini</FONT></CODE> from the download server. Do not think you are starting from scratch.
The <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.ini</FONT></CODE> is always re-downloaded from the server when you reconnect from a
broken connection, but the download process will pick up from where it left off
(or from the beginning of the last file incompletely downloaded), once the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.ini</FONT></CODE> has been re-downloaded</LI> 
<LI>please do not try and use WinZip or any other ZIP program to unzip and
install <B>Cygwin</B> at any point. The <B>Cygwin</B> <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> file will do it for you and will do it correctly</LI> 
<LI>if you ever need to uninstall any or all of the files, you should use the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> to do so. <A HREF="#install">Click here for more information</A> on how
to uninstall</LI> 
</UL> 
<P><B>Choose A Download Source</B>: once you have downloaded the<B> Cygwin</B> <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> file, click on the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> icon and click the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE> button. You will be asked to choose between <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Install from Internet</FONT></CODE>, <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Download from Internet</FONT></CODE> or <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Install from Local Directory</FONT></CODE><B></B>. Choose <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Download from Internet</FONT></CODE> and click the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE> button.</P> 
<P><B>Select Local Package Directory</B>: you will now be asked to define the
local package directory (where you want the downloaded files to be stored to on
your hard drive &#150; not where the program folder or files will eventually be
placed). This can be any folder where you normally download files to from the
Internet. We suggest you create a folder called <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Cygwin Download Files</FONT></CODE> to download the files to. Click on the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE> button</P> 
<P><B>Select Your Internet Connection</B>: select <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Direct Connection</FONT></CODE> (and make sure you are already connected to the Internet) and then
click on the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE> button</P> 
<P><B>Choose a Download Site</B>: we suggest you choose
<A HREF="http://mirrors.sunsite.dk"
 TARGET="_blank">http://mirrors.sunsite.dk</A>, as this site supports
re-downloading from where you left off if you are disconnected from the
Internet whilst still downloading files. Other mirrors and servers may also
offer this facility. Remember the following:</P> 
<UL> 
<LI>not all mirrors appear to update the setup.ini regularly. The setup.ini may
therefore change from server to server. It's best to choose a server, check it
works for you, and continue the download process through to the end, instead of
changing servers halfway and running the risk of starting up again with a
different setup.ini and the problems that may (or may not) be generated for
you</LI> 
</UL> 
<P><B>Select packages to download</B>: you must now ensure the following
packages (program files) are selected for download. Remember the following:</P>

<UL> 
<LI>if you have to select certain packages manually, because they are not
selected by default, and you are then disconnected from the Internet whilst
downloading the packages, when you reconnect to the server and the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.ini</FONT></CODE> (the download instructions which tell the server what packages) is
re-loaded, it will be re-loaded with the default selections only. You must
therefore always reselect manually any packages you had to select manually
first time round. If you do not do so, they will not be downloaded and
<B>Cygwin</B> will not necessarily work for you</LI> 
</UL> 
<P>First click the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">View</FONT></CODE> button. This will open up the list of packages which can be downloaded
and show you which of them are selected by default. In addition to the packages
which are selected by default, you have to select the following packages
manually:</P> 
<UL> 
<LI>- cvs (Category: Devel)</LI> 
<LI>- openssh (Category: Net)</LI> 
<LI>- openssl (Category: Libs)</LI> 
<LI>- patch (Category: Utils)</LI> 
</UL> 
<P>Now click the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE> button and wait for the files you have selected to be downloaded.</P> 
<P>Once the files have been downloaded, installation is very simple. Click
again on the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">setup.exe</FONT></CODE> as before, and when you get to the section <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Choose a Download Source</FONT></CODE>, select <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Install from Local Directory</FONT></CODE>, the directory being the directory you downloaded the program files to
from the Internet. Click on <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE>.</P> 
<P><B>Select Root Install Directory</B>: the default directory is <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">C:\cygwin</FONT></CODE>. We suggest you do not modify this default. Leave all other selections
as default and click on <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE>.</P> 
<P><B>Select Local Package Directory</B>: the default directory will be the
directory you downloaded the program files to from the Internet. We suggest you
do not modify this default. Click on <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE>.</P> 
<P><B><A NAME="install">Select packages to
install/keep/reinstall/uninstall</A></B>: make sure the default packages as
listed above are all checked to be installed if this is the first installation.
If a package shows <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Keep</FONT></CODE>, this means the package is already installed. Remember the
following:</P> 
<UL> 
<LI>if you ever need to uninstall any or all of the packages, instead of
checking the packages to <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Keep</FONT></CODE> or <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Reinstall</FONT></CODE>, select <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Uninstall</FONT></CODE> at this point in the process</LI> 
</UL> 
<P>Click on <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Next</FONT></CODE>. The packages will now be installed.</P>

<P><A NAME="2"><B>Generating your public and private keys</B></A> |
<A HREF="#top">top</A></P> 
<P>Click on the <B>Cygwin</B> icon which you should have on your Desktop. This
will open a black window. Type the following line into the black window:</P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">ssh-keygen -d</FONT></CODE></P> 
<P> This commands the program to generate an SSH2 key (the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">-d</FONT></CODE> extension specifies a DSA/SSH2 key which is the type that
OpenOffice.org needs). Depending on the speed of your processor, it could take
anywhere from several seconds to several minutes. When finished, it will prompt
you for a file in which to save the key. You should press the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Enter</FONT></CODE> key without typing anything else in. Although the prompt appears to be
a filepath without a filename, it does actually include the filename too. Don't
add anything else to this filepath and name - if you do you will then have
problems later on which you will only be able to solve if you understand how to
use Unix directories.</P> 
<P>You will then be asked to enter a passphrase. It is strongly recommended
that you enter one, and that it be fairly good. (This means: try to avoid using
real words, change the case, incorporate numbers, symbols, or some other
combination.) </P> 
<P>Whilst you are keying in your passphrase, you will not see any characters
being typed up onto the black window, nor will a cursor move. You are
nevertheless registering the passphrase as you type. You will be asked to enter
this passphrase twice. Make sure you make careful note of it: you will be asked
for it every time you log in to the OpenOffice.org SSH2 server, which you will
have to connect to using this public key.</P> 
<P>Once you have entered the passphrase twice, you will then be told that the
"identification" has been saved in the default file you stipulated above, and
that the "public key" has been saved in a file bearing that same name but with
a <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">.pub</FONT></CODE> suffix. The .pub signifies that it is the public key. It is this file
you should then send to OpenOffice.org. You will find it in the following
folder (as long as you have used default values throughout the
installation):</P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000"> C:\cygwin\home\Standard\.ssh</FONT></CODE></P> 
<P>In order to be able to use this public key, you should either send it via
the OpenOffice.org IssueZilla bug-reporting system, if you know how to do this,
logging in with your OpenOffice.org website login name and password (not the
passphrase you have used to generate the public key), creating an issue which
you can call My Public Key or something similar, and then attaching the public
key to the issue.</P> 
<P>You may however prefer to ask your project leader to help you with the
procedure. </P> 
<P>In any case, once this public key has been placed on the OpenOffice.org
server, and you have been told it has been placed there (it is not an automatic
process and you may have to wait a few days), you will be able to continue with
the process of CVS-ing under OpenOffice.org. </P> 
<P>Remember that this public key will be used in conjunction with your
OpenOffice.org website login name, and that although you need the passphrase
associated with the public key to tunnel, your website login name and
associated password are needed for you to be able to use the tunnel in order to
CVS on the OpenOffice.org site. That is to say:</P> 
<UL> 
<LI>you need your public key to be physically present on the OpenOffice.org
server in order to create a tunnel</LI> 
<LI>your need to have an OpenOffice.org website login name and login password
to be able to CVS on an OpenOffice.org project, using the tunnel you have
created</LI>

<P><A NAME="3"><B>Creating a tunnel and minimising the window</B></A> |
<A HREF="#top">top</A></P> 
<P>First, click on the <B>Cygwin</B> icon on your Desktop. The black window
will open again. At the prompt, enter the following phrase:</P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">ssh -2 -x -L 2401:localhost:2401 tunnel@openoffice.org</FONT></CODE></P> 
<P>If you have problems typing in the "@" sign, you may have a key on your
keyboard which is called Alt Gr, or Alt plus something else: press it along
with the key where the "@" sign appears.</P> 
<P>The server will ask you for your passphrase. Enter it. If this is your first
time, the server will send you a message along these lines: </P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Host key not found from the list of known hosts. 
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? </FONT></CODE></P> 
<P> Enter:</P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Yes</FONT></CODE></P> 
<P> (You can't just enter "y"; you have to spell it out fully.)</P> 
<P>The server will then respond with: </P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">Host "openoffice.org" added to the list of known hosts</FONT></CODE></P> 
<P>The screen does not show a prompt. That's how it should be. The tunnel has
been established. You are now ready to begin using CVS. You can, at this point,
minimize the black window, but do not close it by clicking on the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">X</FONT></CODE> in the top right-hand corner. If you close it, you will be closing the
tunnel you have just created.</P>

<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">cvs -d:pserver:{my openoffice.org website login name}@localhost:/cvs login</FONT></CODE></P>

the following command:</P> 
<P><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">cvs -d:pserver:walter@localhost:/cvs login</FONT></CODE></P> 
<P>You will now be asked for your CVS password, which is the password
associated with your OpenOffice.org website login name, not the passphrase you

close the window this way, instead of by clicking on the <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">X</FONT></CODE> in the top right-hand corner, the next time you open the window CVS,
you will be able to use the up/down arrows to flick through the commands you

<P><A NAME="5"><B>Downloading and installing Tortoise CVS</B></A> |
<A HREF="#top">top</A></P> 
<P>Assuming you are connected to the Internet, go the following web: </P> 
<P><A
HREF="http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml">http://www.tortoisecvs.org/download.shtml</A>,<BR>
or simply <A HREF="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">http://www.tortoisecvs.org</A>

<P>Choose the most recent stable version of <B>TortoiseCVS</B> available and
download it to your hard drive.</P> 
<P>Install the program, using the default values in all circumstances. </P> 
<P>Once you have installed TortoiseCVS, you will see that when you right-click
on any folder under Windows Explorer, you will see a series of commands have
been added to the normal ones on this menu. You are now ready to upload
modified files to your project's OpenOffice.org repository. The meaning of the
four most important commands is explained in the following section.</P> 
<P>NOTE 1: If Cygwin is handling text files in Unix format, you should uncheck
the "Check not Unix sandbox" in the Quirky tabs of TortoiseCVS preferences. If
you do not do so, an annoying dialogue box will pop up complaining about "an
attempt to checkout Unix Sandbox on Windows machines"; TortoiseCVS may then
crash.</P> 
<P>NOTE 2: With a standard Cygwin and TortoiseCVS installation, you may have to
select the Cygwin CVS binary in order to be able to use TortoiseCVS under the
procedures described in this HowTo.</P>

files to a project repository from your hard drive which you modified), adding

the repository), and adding new files recursively (add a folder or several
folders and/or several HTML files which didn't previously exist in the
repository)</B></A> | <A HREF="#top">top</A></P> 
<P>There are four basic commands which you will need to understand in order to
modify files within your project and upload them to the project site.</P> 
<P>Before you do so, you should understand the meaning of the following:</P> 
<UL> 
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#C70000">updating</FONT></B> - this means downloading files
from a project repository on the OpenOffice.org server to your hard drive which
have been modified by other developers. This is not the same as when you
"checked out" - "checking out" is creating a copy of the repository on your
hard drive for the very first time</LI> 
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#C70000">committing</FONT></B> - this means uploading files
to a project repository on the OpenOffice.org server which you have
modified</LI> 
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#C70000">adding</FONT></B> - this means creating a new
filename on the project repository, after first having created the file itself
on your hard drive. This file will only ever exist on the project repository if
you use both the "add" command first (adding means that you are registering the
new filename on the repository), and then the "commit" command second (making
the addition a reality by sending the content associated with that
filename)</LI> 
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#C70000">adding recursively</FONT></B> - this means that
instead of first "adding" a new folder name and then "committing" it, and then
"adding" each file within that new folder one by one and "committing" them by
one by one, you can simply choose to "add recursively" (register both the new
folder name and/or multiple filenames together) and then "commit" the whole
folder (sending all the content associated with all the new filenames you have
registered together)</LI> 
</UL> 
<P>In order to do all of this, you only need to remember the following:</P> 
<OL> 
<LI>Create a tunnel first, using the procedure already described above. Don't
forget to minimise the black window</LI> 
<LI>Use Windows Explorer to find the folder where your project repository has
been stored on your own hard drive. If your project is the Spanish lang project
and you have used default values throughout the whole installation of Cygwin,
you will find your project files in the following folder:<BR><BR><CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">C:\cygwin\home\Standard\es\www</FONT></CODE></LI> 
</OL> 
<P>In order to <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">update</FONT></CODE>, <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">commit</FONT></CODE>, <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">add</FONT></CODE> or <CODE><FONT COLOR="#C70000">add recursively</FONT></CODE>, all you need to do is select the folder which contains files you need
to work on, click on your right-hand mouse button, and select the command you
need to use. The process will then be carried out automatically.</P>

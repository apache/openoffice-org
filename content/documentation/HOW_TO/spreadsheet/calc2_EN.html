<H3><A NAME="1"></A> 1. Introduction</H3>
<P>These automations make data insertion easier in Calc. For instance, when you 
  type Monday into a cell, there is a mechanism to allow inserting all the days 
  of the week. The same mechanism works for month lists, as well. OpenOffice.org 
  allows you to automatically insert the most used Sort Lists. </P>
<P>It's the same for a number or date series. With a single click or dragging 
  action, you will be able to increase the series of numbers or years. Very practical, 
  isn't it?</P>
<H3><A NAME="2"></A>2. Sort Lists</H3>
<P>Here's an easy example: Type the word January in a cell, select the cell (it 
  has to be surrounded from a thick rectangle with a small square on the lower 
  right corner), and click on that square without releasing the mouse button and 
  drag the mouse.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="list1.GIF" NAME="Graphic1" ALT="list example 1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=241 HEIGHT=245 BORDER=0></P>
<P><BR>
  Magic! By dragging the mouse, the words are automatically displayed in a yellow 
  floating info box. Stop at March and the cells will be automatically updated.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="list2.GIF" NAME="Graphic2" ALT="list example 2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=124 HEIGHT=107 BORDER=0></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>These lists are already recorded in the software; there are a lot of them, 
  and of course, you can record your own lists. Let's see how this is possible.</P>
<UL>
  <LI>In <B>Tools-Options-Spreadsheet-Sort Lists,</B> let's discover those lists 
    that are already present
</UL>
<P><img src="list3.GIF" width="709" height="362"><BR>
  There are 4 default recorded lists. In the image above, there is an additional 
  custom list. </P>
<P>You can insert them from the left, right, upwards, or downwards. Of course, 
  the order will be respected: If you start with Monday then drag your mouse upwards, 
  the next displayed day will be Sunday. Same thing, if you drag your mouse to 
  the left.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Now, we'll create our own sort list</li>
  <li>Type the list in your sheet,</li>
  <li>Select it by highlighting,</li>
  <li>Choose <B>Tools-Options-Spreadsheet-Sort Lists, </B></li>
  <li>In the dialog window that it will appear, you'll see the '<B>Copy'</B> button. 
    Next to this button there is a text box, named '<B>Copy list from</B>'. You 
    should read there the sheet name and the cells range you have previously selected,</li>
  <li>Click on the '<B>Copy</B>' button,</li>
  <li>Then, your custom sort list is listed in the main Sort Lists text box!</li>
</ol>
<P><IMG SRC="list4.GIF" NAME="Graphic4" ALT="list example 4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=588 HEIGHT=297 BORDER=0><BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
</P>
<P>Now, you are able to use it in your sheets, in 
  every way, being sure that the order will always be respected. In fact, you 
  can start from whichever element of the list you choose.</P>
<P>If you don't wish to keep that sample list: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Select it in the Sort Lists windows and click on the '<B>Delete</B>' button 
    to remove it.
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="3"></A>3. AutoFill</H3>
<P>The AutoFill is similar to the procedure described above.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select a cell range,</li>
  <li>Under <B>Edit-Fill</B>; Choose '<B>Series...</B>' ,</li>
</ol>
<P><IMG SRC="remp1.GIF" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="filling window" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=614 HEIGHT=220 BORDER=0><BR>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <B>Direction section, </B>determine in which direction you wish to 
    fill your cells</li>
  <li>For the time being, in <B>Series Type, </B>choose<B> Linear,</B></li>
  <li>In <B>Start value,</B> type '2'; in <B>End value,</B> insert '16'; and finally 
    in <B>Increment,</B> type '2'. We have set up to fill the cells with numbers 
    from 2 to 16 incremented progressively by 2. </li>
  <li>Let's see the result:</li>
</ol>
<P><IMG SRC="remp2.jpg" NAME="Graphic6" ALT="filling example 2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=172 BORDER=0><BR>

<P>Wonderful! We have filled 8 cells only, but try to imagine if there were 3000. 
  What a time savings!</P>
<P>Let's analyse the other filling options:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>'<B>Growth</B>': it's similar to linear, but this option allows not selecting 
    the exact range of cells to be filled; though it is obligatory to insert the 
    <B>End value. E</B>ven if you have selected only a few cells, the filling 
    action will continue until the End Value has been reached, while the linear 
    mode respects the number of cells you have selected,
  <LI>'<B>Date</B>': gives you the access to the section '<B>Time Unit</B>'. It's 
    an explicit choice, you have to select what you wish to be displayed. Remember 
    to fill the fields '<B>Start Value</B>', '<B>End Value</B>', and '<B>Increment</B>'
  <LI>AutoFill: will fill your cells from a start value.
</UL>
<P><I><B>Note</B> : As far as the Date 
  AutoFill is concerned, don't forget to format your cells with the format <B>'Date'</B> 
  in the format <B>'Number' </B>as they are by default; otherwise, you'll get 
  the wrong result.<BR>
  After you have acknowledged your mistake after the AutoFill action, selecting 
  the related cell range and formatting it correctly will resolve the issue. </I></P>
<P>A faster trick is:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Type 1 inside cell A1,
  <LI>Type 3 inside cell A2,
  <LI>Select both cells by clicking on the first, hold down the [<B>SHIFT</B>] 
    key, and press the arrow key,
  <LI>Click the little square on the bottom right corner of the highlighted area 
    and drag downward with the mouse, your cells will be increased 2 by 2!

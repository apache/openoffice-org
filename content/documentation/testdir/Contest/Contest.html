<H2 CLASS="western">Why We are Having the competition</H2>
<P>OpenOffice.org is becoming more and moer widely used.  The
community continues to gain strength and grow but we recognize that
we do not have a wealth of templates and clipart under our own
banner. Even the external sites that provide these are not expanding
their collections; so here's the challenge. Create and submit
templates and clipart as part of the competition and be eligible for
a share of cash awards of  over US$5000 provided by our sponsor,
worldart.com, and other awards.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The OpenOffice.org documentation project is running this
competition in conjunction with WorldArt, which, we hope, is the
start of a series of competitions. OpenOffice.org lives as open
SOURCE Community of the interest and commitment of its users and
project members. Each user of OpenOffice.org is called to provide own
templates or clipart and send these in. These will become publicly 
available from <A HREF="http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/index.html">http://documentation.openoffice.org/Samples_Templates/</A></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">NOTE: Entries MUST come with an explanation and
be released under the LGPL to be considered. A screenshot of the work
would also be appreciated but not essential. Submissions will be by
email to the following address <A HREF="mailto:contest@documentation.openoffice.org">contest@documentation.openoffice.org</A></H3>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT SIZE=3>Submissions must be date
stamped before 23h59 on  3 October 2006 to the email address above as
attachments. Depending on the number of submissions, notification of 
the winners, is expected to be completed by 31 October 2006 or
sooner.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="teil"></A>Conditions of participation 
</H2>
<P>Everyone can participate and may submit as many submissions (one
per message)  as they can without penalty. 
</P>
<P>All templates submitted must be presented in open OpenOffice.org
template format (e.g. * ott * for Writer templates). Clipart may be
in any graphic format, including Draw.</P>
<P>Templates should have an appropriate, generally accepted
utilization value and not be &quot;banal&quot;. The submitted
templates should useful to other users. For example, an empty Writer
file with inserted, current date is surely no &quot;meaningful&quot;
template. However, a Calc spreadsheet template that can be used  for
cataloguing a stamp collection or other collection will surely
qualify. 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Some Ideas for Templates:</B></FONT></P>
<P>Business cards, letterheads, cards, Memos and faxes, invoices
accounting templates, newsletters, resumes, expense reports, base
forms, presentation template,  cd cover, spreadsheet templates, 
calenders..... for Writer, Calc, Base... Use text fields for folks to
personalize, have areas for businesses to insert logos, create all
types of useful templates for all types of home and business uses for
our community to share.</P>

<H1>Our Sponsor</H1>
<P><A HREF="http://www.worldlabel.com/"><IMG SRC="logo1.gif" NAME="WORLDLABEL.COM" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=293 HEIGHT=53 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT></A>Our
sponsor, Worldlabel, has committed US$5000 to expand the number of
templates in the OpenOffice.org document project repertoire. To have
a share of this pool, your template or collection of clipart should
be a significant contribution.  A panel of three judges will evaluate
and select the finalists and, with the co-operation of the sponsor,
allocate prizes in proportion.</P>

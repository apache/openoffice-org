<h3>My public key has been uploaded to the server; what is the next step?</h3>
<p>You know this has happened when they tell you your key has been uploaded. This will occur as a response from the support team on the issue where you sent your public key. Now you need the procedure to establish a tunnel: ( <a href="013.html">Linux</a> | <a href="014.html">Mac</a> | <a href="012.html">Windows</a> ). You also need to request for permission to the project you wish to access. Do this on the same issue as where you submitted your public key.</p>

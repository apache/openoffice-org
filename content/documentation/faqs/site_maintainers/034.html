		<h3>Why is the issue marked FIXED when I still see the bug in the latest version?</h3>
		<p>The life cycle of an issue has several stages, and FIXED does not automatically mean that the fix for the problem is really available in the latest snapshot version. Instead, if an issue is marked as FIXED, then it just means that the developer checked in the fix, nothing more.</p>
		<p>Developers only work on branches in the code repository (so-called <a href="http://tools.openoffice.org" target="_blank">child workspaces</a> or CWS), while the snapshot is made from the top of the repository. FIXED only means the fix made it into a CWS, without any information when it will be publicly available.</p>
		<p>If you want to see the status of the CWS where an issue is fixed, perform the following steps.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to <a href="http://eis.services.openoffice.org">http://eis.services.openoffice.org</a>.</li>
			<li>Log on as guest.</li>
			<li>In the menu, select "Child Workspaces" and "Search".</li>
			<li>Enter the number of the issue, preceded by an "i" (for instance "i12345" to search for issue 12345) into the "TaskId" field.</li>
			<li>Click the "Find" button.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This will give you a list of CWS' to which the respective task has been added (usually exactly one). Also, administrative information about the CWS is shown, the most interesting being the "Milestone (integrated)" column. Only if you have a snapshot with a milestone number greater or equal to the one shown here, you can expect the bug to be fixed.</p>
		<p>Note that if the "Milestone (integrated)" field is empty for the CWS you found, this simply means the fix is not yet available in any snapshot.</p>
		<p>If all of the above is too much to know for you, the easy rule is: If a bug is CLOSED, it should be fixed in a snapshot. If it's only FIXED, don't expect anything. The reasoning behind this process is explained in the task handling policies, as written down on the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/">QA pages</a>, in particular in <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/workflowcharts/taskhandling_workflow_issuetracker_fix_close.html">A Bug's lifetime</a>.</p>

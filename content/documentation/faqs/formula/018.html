<h3>I have inserted a formula in a HTML document and now I cannot edit it. Why not?</h3>
<P>There is currently no standard for embedding mathematical formulas
in HTML documents. For this reason OpenOffice.org saves formulas in
HTML documents as bitmap pictures (in GIF format), which every
browser can display.</P>
<P>This has the consequence that you when you close and reopen your
document the formulas are no longer editable, because they cannot be
reconstructed from the bitmap.</P>
<P>This solution has a number of other problems, for example the
formulas doesn't look good when printed; in fact they look ugly.</P>
<P>A standard as to how MathML formulas can be embedded in HTML (or
XHTML) pages is expected to appear in the future. Since
OpenOffice.org can export HTML as well as MathML it would be
reasonable to expect that it will support this standard when it
arrives.</P>
<P>Another issue here, however, is that this also requires that
browsers support MathML. The Mozilla project is working on this, see
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/</A>.</P>

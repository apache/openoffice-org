<h3>What are the differences between 
  StarOffice and OpenOffice.org?</h3>
<p>The differences between StarOffice 
  and OpenOffice.org can be accounted for in two ways: </p>
<p>A. Differences between StarOffice 
  5.2 and the future of StarOffice </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The source code has undergone some 
    significant changes since 5.2 was released. Some of these changes are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removal of integrated desktop 
      </li>
    <li>Componentization of word processing, 
      spreadsheet and graphic applications modules</li>
    <li>Removal of email and calendar 
      and the schedule server </li>
    <li>Removal of the Browser</li>
    <li>Move to XML File Formats</li>
    <li>Improved Microsoft Filters</li>
    <li>CJK support (CJK refers to Asian 
      languages: C=Chinese, simple and traditional, J= Japanese, K= Korean)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are all changes that were 
    decided upon by Sun Microsystems before the source code was released to the 
    community. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>B. Differences between StarOffice 
  and OpenOffice.org </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The source code available at OpenOffice.org 
    does not consist of all of the StarOffice code. Usually, the reason for this 
    is that Sun pays to license third party code to include in StarOffice that 
    which it does not have permission to make available in OpenOffice.org. Those 
    things which are or will be present in StarOffice but are not available on 
    OpenOffice.org include: </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Certain fonts (including, especially, Asian language fonts)</li>
   <li>The database component (Adabas D)</li>
   <li>Templates included with StarOffice</li>
   <li>Extensive Clip Art Gallery</li>
   <li>Some sorting functionality (Asian versions)</li>
   <li>Certain file filters</li>
  </ul>

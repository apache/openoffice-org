<h3>How do I fix the internal error, Get Storage: No Content?</h3>
<p>OpenOffice.org fails to start, and the following error message appears:</p>
<p><tt>OpenOffice can not be started due to an error in accessing the OpenOffice.org configuration data.<br>Please contact your system administrator.<br>The following internal error has occurred: Get Storage: "No Content".</tt></p>
<p>The message often occurs because a file named Common.xcu becomes corrupted. In most cases, this file becomes filled with 0s. The problem seems to occur most often in Windows, possibly as a result of a crash or an improper exit while OpenOffice.org was open.</p> 
<hr>
<h4>Windows systems:</h4>
<p>It is easiest to use the Find function (sometimes called Search) in the Windows Explorer to locate this file in Windows.</p> 
<p><b><i>Multi-user installations:</i></b></p>
<p>Where OpenOffice.org is installed as multi-user under Windows NT/W2k/XP, this file is likely to be in a special system user directory. Therefore, one must have administrator rights and enable the option to view system directories in Explorer before using the Find function. This particular file should be found in the following path:</p>
<p><tt>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application&nbsp;Data\OpenOffice.org<release>\&lt;user&gt;\registry\data\org\openoffice\Office\Common.xcu</tt></p> 
<p>where <i>user</i> is an actual user name.</p> 
<p>Once the file is located, simply rename the file (for example, to something like Common.xcu.old) and restart OpenOffice.org. A new Common.xcu file is created, and the problem should disappear. 
<p><b><i>Single-user installations:</i></b></p>
<p>Where OpenOffice.org is installed for a single user, this file is likely to be in the following path:</p>
<p><tt>C:\Program&nbsp;Files\OpenOffice.org<release>\&lt;user&gt;\registry\data\org\openoffice\Office\Common.xcu.</tt></p>
<p>If the OS is NT/W2k/XP, this file may be in a special system user directory, so use administrator rights and enable the option to view system directories in Explorer before using the Find function. In Windows 95/98/ME, the location will likely be in the suggested path. Again, once the file is located, simply rename the file (for example, to something like Common.xcu.old) and restart OpenOffice.org. A new Common.xcu file will be created and the problem should disappear.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b> There may be shared files called Common.xcu under paths, such as the following:</p>
<p><tt>C:\[some&nbsp;path]\OpenOffice.org<release>\share\registry\......</tt></p>
<p><b>Do NOT delete these shared files!</b></p>
<hr>
<h4>UNIX systems:</h4>
<p>The default location for this file under a UNIX installation (single or multi-user) is the following path:</p> 
<p><tt>$HOME/OpenOffice.org&lt;release&gt;/&lt;user&gt;/registry/data/org/openoffice/Office/Common.xcu</tt></p>
<p>where $HOME is the user's home directory. As above, simply rename the file (for example, to something like Common.xcu.old) and restart OpenOffice.org. A new Common.xcu file will be created and the problem should disappear.</p>
<P> <i><b>Where &lt;release&gt;  is the release number of the OpenOffice.org you have installed and &lt;user&gt; is the user namme of the particular user installation.<b></i></p>

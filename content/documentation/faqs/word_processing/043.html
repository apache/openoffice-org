<h3>How can I rotate a graphic with a given angle?</h3>

<P>Up to version 1.x, Writer doesn't contain a rotation facility for graphics.
To be able to rotate graphics one needs to use Draw:</P>
<UL>
<LI>In your Writer file, select the graphic you want to rotate and copy it.
<LI>Open a Draw window and paste your graphic into the draw file.
<li>Rightclick onto the graphic, select "Position and Size"
<li>Select "Rotation" and rotate according to your needs.
<li>Select your graphic after it has been rotated and copy it.
<li>Go back to Writer and paste the rotated graphic into your file.
</UL>

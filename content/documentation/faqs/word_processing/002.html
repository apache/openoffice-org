<h3>How do I make my first page a cover/title page and start page numbering (Page 1) on the second page of my document?</h3>
<P>Here is the basic procedure for breaking a document
into sections (for whatever purpose) as well as placing a page number
in a footer of the second page: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Open a new word processing
	document. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Enter some or all of the data that
	you want on your cover page (or simply hit the return key a few
	times).</P>
	<LI><P>Press F11 to open the Stylist, choose &quot;Page Styles&quot; from the icons (hover
  with your pointer on each icon to open the note), doubleclick on &quot;First Page&quot; for
  assigning the &quot;First Page&quot; style to the first page of your document.</P>
  <LI><P>Place your cursor at the end of the first page. Select: Insert-&gt;Manual Break...
		</P>
	<LI><P>Select the button next to &quot;Page Break&quot;. Then choose
	the style to use for the next page (pick one from the menu - such as
	&quot;Default&quot;). Then mark the check box called &quot;Change
	page number&quot;. In the box below this check box the number 1
	should appear. Click OK. 
	</P>
	<P>Note: by picking a different style for the next page, you are in
	effect breaking the document into two sections. The sections then
	can have different characteristics (headers, footers, page
	numbering, etc.). The page style that is assigned for each section
	of the document can be seen by clicking into the desired page. Look
	below the document window area, to the right of the &quot;Page x/n&quot;
	block to see the page style name for the current page/section.</P>
	<LI><P>Now you should have two pages. Put
	your cursor in the second page, then select: Insert-&gt;Footer-&gt;Default
  from the pulldown menus. A footer area will appear on the
	second page. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>To insert the page number, select: Insert-&gt;Fields-&gt;Page
	Numbers. A number '1' should appear on the second page of the file
	(because the page number field is counting pages from the beginning
	of the current SECTION). 
	</P>

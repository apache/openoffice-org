<B>3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS</B>

<P><B>3.1 Application of License.</B>

<BR>The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every
copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license
for shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance
with this Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with
all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty
(120) days before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish either
(i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation
of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications
or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and to make any such deviation
and reference implementation or Modifications available to all third parties
under the same terms as this license on a royalty free basis within thirty
(30) days of Your first customer shipment of Your Modifications.

<P><B>3.2 Required Notices.</B>

<BR>You must duplicate the notice in <B>Exhibit A </B>in each file of the
Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <B>Exhibit
A</B>. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating
to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely
clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result
of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

<P><B>3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.</B>

<BR>You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only
if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original
Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version
of the Original Code is available under the terms of this License. The
notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or
Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the
Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different
from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under
a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer.
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

<P><B>3.4 Larger Works.</B>

<BR>You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.

<P><B>4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION</B>

<P>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute,
judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations
and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions
of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
skill to be able to understand it.

<P><B>5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE</B>

<P>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set out in Section
3.1.

<P><B>6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE</B>

<P><B>6.1 New Versions.</B>

<BR>Sun may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

<P><B>6.2 Effect of New Versions.</B>

<BR>Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of
the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms
of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other
than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.

<P><B>7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</B>

<P>ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL CODE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME
THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
ORIGINAL CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

<P><B>8.0 TERMINATION</B>

<P><B>8.1</B> This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses
to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

<P><B>8.2</B> In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
termination shall survive termination.

<P><B>9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY</B>

<P>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

<H2>Proposal for a unified API for exporting and saving documents</H2>
<P>Impress has two different kinds of export filters. Some of them
can be used for &bdquo;SaveAs&ldquo; (like PowerPoint and StarOffice
binary filters), some of them are only accessible throuh the &bdquo;Export&ldquo;
function. While the first kind of filters can be used via API (
com::sun::star::XStorable::store(To/AsURL) ), the second kind of
filters can't. We want to change this, and the most natural way is to
use the same API for both. The &bdquo;Export&ldquo; functionality in
the user interface will use this API in the same way the &bdquo;SaveAs&ldquo;
functionality does it, with some slight differences:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>&bdquo;Export&ldquo; uses storeToURL, SaveAs uses storeAsURL.
	The difference is, that the latter method also changes the URL of
	the document in memory.</P>
	<LI><P>This implies that it's not possible to use a pure export
	filter in the storeAsURL method, because the generated file would
	not be importable. Pure export filters can only be used in the
	storeToURL method. Using a wrong filter will cause throwing of an
	exception.</P>
	<LI><P>To ease the implementation to find out which filters shall be
	used in which funtion, &bdquo;Export&ldquo; uses only pure export
	filters, while &bdquo;SaveAs&ldquo; only uses filters that can both
	import and export. If an Import/Export filter should also be used
	for &bdquo;Exporting&ldquo;, another filter must be created in the
	filter configuration for the same file type, but without the
	&bdquo;Import&ldquo; flag set. If new filters are created in the
	configuration, they can get the same UI names as the old
	import/export filter (because they won't be seen in the same file
	dialog), but must get a new internal filter name. Filter names of
	import filters must not be changed, because they may have been used
	before. If an import filter shall not be used in the &bdquo;SaveAs&ldquo;
	dialog, they must not have the &bdquo;Export&ldquo; flag set, use a
	different filter ony for export.<BR>We will have three kind of
	filters then: pure import filter (document can't be stored over the
	old file after loading), pure export filters (saved document is not
	loadable again, so this filter will be used only in the &bdquo;Export&ldquo;
	function) and combined import/export filters.</P>
	<LI><P>Export filters support an additional property
	&bdquo;ExportSelection&ldquo; in the media descriptor, that tells
	the filter to export only the current selection and not the whole
	document. This will be reflected by a checkbox in the file dialog.</P>
</OL>
<P>All parameters to configure the export operation will be passed in
the &bdquo;FilterData&ldquo; property of the media descriptor that is
passed to the filter (implemented as sequence&lt;PropertyValue&gt;).
If there is no configuration data given, the filter must use some
suitable defaults. 
</P>
<P>In the user interface it's also possible to provide a UI component
that retrieves the needed information and adds it to the media
descriptor. If the filter wants, it can also store the input in a
configuration file and use it as default in the next operation
without given parameters. Here also the &bdquo;UserData&ldquo;
parameter of the Typedetection.xml can be used for storing the
configuration. This is only possible for data representable as a
string, but the advantage is that the default for the filter can be
specified in the Typedetection.xml, not in the source code. In this
case the filter implementation first must look for &bdquo;FilterData&ldquo;,
then for &bdquo;UserData&ldquo;.</P>
<P>The UI component is identified by an implementation name in the
filter configuration (Typedetection.xml). The UI code for the
&bdquo;Export&ldquo; function will look into the configuration and
instantiate the UI component. The exact interface for this component
will be specified in a different proposal, it should use a media
descriptor as input/output paremeter and return a boolean value, that
will be set to &bdquo;false&ldquo; if the user cancels the operation.</P>
<P>The UI component is not restricted for usage inside the &bdquo;Export&ldquo;
functionality. We will also have this new feature for the filters
used for loading and storing documents.</P>
<P>At the end we will have one single API for storing or exporting
documents, one single set of filters with a common API, only the two
UI functions will use it in two different ways. This API also enables
other developers to provide export filters for OO.o documents using
our filter API, with the additional capabilities of exporting only
parts of the document.</P>
<P>Of course this mechanism can be used in other office components
also.</P>
<P>ToDo's:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Extend Typedetection.xml for new implementation name for UI
	component and change filtercache implementation. Make sure that the
	compatibilty to 6.0 is preserved.</P>
	<LI><P>Provide properties &bdquo;ExportSelection&ldquo; and
	&bdquo;FilterData&ldquo; in media descriptor and SfxItemSet at
	SfxMedium.</P>
	<LI><P>Divide filters into import, export and import/export filters.</P>
	<LI><P>Create interface for the UI component.</P>
	<LI><P>Implement a UI component for all current export filters and
	register it for all of them in the configuration.</P>
	<LI><P>Move the old &bdquo;core&ldquo; code from the FuExport to the
	ConvertTo method in Impress.</P>
	<LI><P>Offer SID_EXPORT in SFX that will look for the UI component
	and feed the API call.</P>
	<LI><P>Check for pure export filters in storeToURL and for pure
	import filters in store calls.</P>
	<LI><P>Enable the current code for loading and storing documents to
	use the filters UI components.</P>
	<LI><P>Document all parameters of our current export filters.</P>
</OL>

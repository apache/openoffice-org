<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This document is based on the
</FONT><A HREF="apply_button_spec.htm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">first
proposal</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"> for a new
Apply button concept in StarOffice / OpenOffice.org. Based on the
feedback of the community, we decided to think this concept over. As
a result a new idea came up, which is described in this document.</FONT></P>
<P>The initial idea of having an Apply button in dialogs was to
improve the usability of the program, namely the dialog handling,
with the goal to reduce the number of steps a user would have to
complete a task. Therefore an Apply button seemed to be a good
solution as it allows applying and changing settings without having
to re-open a dialog several times.</P>
<P>The community's feedback to the proposal for the use of an Apply
button in dialogs has shown some problems that would occur when
introducing it in the application as suggested. 
</P>
<P>The disadvantage of the proposed button set was that</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>it contained too much buttons what could be dazzling for a
	user</P>
	<LI><P>the combination of OK, Cancel/Close, Apply could be confusing
	for a user</P>
	<LI><P>the meaning of an Apply button might not be intuitively
	understandable</P>
	<LI><P>it might not be understood easily which data will be effected
	by the Reset button: single tab, whole dialog or applied data.</P>
</UL>
<P>The community's feedback also made clear, that not an Apply
(=Assign) button is desired but a Preview (=Try) feature. Whereas an
Apply always assigns settings made in a dialog, a Preview is only for
testing the settings without applying them ultimately.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2.1.Modeless and Modal Dialogs|outline"></A>Modeless and
Modal Dialogs</H2>
<P>The proposed Apply concept did not distinguish between modal and
modeless dialog boxes, as the possibility of &quot;testing&quot; some
settings with having the dialog opened should not depend on the
dialog type. Therefore the Apply button - that is usually used in
modeless dialog boxes - seemed to be a good solution for modal
dialogs, too. But this does not correspond to the desired Preview
feature:</P>
<P>In <B>modeless</B> dialog boxes an Apply button is necessary, that
assigns settings to the actual selection. Changing the selection is
possible here. Thus it must be possible to assign settings ultimately
before changing the selection. Here Apply has the same functionality
as an OK button, the only difference is, that the dialog box is not
closed when pressing Apply. The sense of an Apply button is not for
testing but for a better and faster workflow as the dialog remains
open when switching the selection.</P>
<P>When introducing this Apply button to <B>modal</B> dialog boxes,
the behavior of the Apply button must, of course, be the same. Thus
the settings made in a dialog must be assigned to the document/object
selection ultimately. But this is something, the user might not
expect or what he does not want. Instead something like a Preview or
Try button, that is only for testing the settings without applying
them ultimately, should be offered. The final assignment should be
done by clicking on an OK button. (Otherwise, if the settings are
assigned ultimately via Apply, an Undo of the settings made could be
too complicated for the user.)</P>
<H1><A NAME="3.Live Mode Concept|outline"></A>Live Mode Concept</H1>
<P>Trying to find a solution for all those issues that came up in the
community's discussion, a new idea came up, which is described in the
following.</P>
<H2><A NAME="3.1.Basic Functionality|outline"></A>Basic Functionality</H2>
<P>Two different button sets should be used for modal/modeless
dialogs, that only offer the basic functionality that is necessary</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>modal: OK, Cancel, Help</P>
	<LI><P>modeless: Apply, Close, Help</P>
</UL>
<P>Beneath these buttons a Live mode icon is offered for both dialog
types. If Live mode is active, all settings made in the dialog get
directly visible in the document. But they are not applied ultimately
unless the user clicks on OK (for modal) or Apply (for modeless
dialogs). Switching back to Normal mode is possible by clicking on
the Live mode icon again (=deactivation).</P>
<P>If the user changes something in the Normal/Live mode and then
switches to Live/Normal mode, the information within the dialog
should not be lost:</P>
<P>When switching from Normal mode to Live mode, the changes made
before get directly visible in the document.</P>
<P>When switching from Live mode to Normal mode, the screen display
of the document switches back to its former state, with those
settings that were valid, before the dialog was opened. (But the
settings made in the Live mode are not re-set in the dialog.)</P>
<H2><A NAME="3.2.Buttons|outline"></A>Buttons</H2>
<P>The button set is reduced to a minimum, whereby modal and modeless
dialogs must have different sets due to their nature.</P>
<P>The buttons behave as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>OK: Finally applies the settings made. The dialog is closed.</P>
	<LI><P>Cancel: Cancels the settings made to return to the original
	state before the dialog was opened (=undo for all steps). The dialog
	is closed.</P>
	<LI><P><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Apply: Changes are
	applied to the selected object within the document but the dialog
	box is not closed.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Close: Closes the
	dialog. (Settings are not applied to the document, unless the user
	has used the Apply button before.)</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P>Help: Opens context sensitive help for the dialog.</P>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="3.3.Undo|outline"></A>Undo</H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Undo is possible via menu
(Edit &#150; Undo). Thus for modal dialogs the user can use this
command after the dialog has been closed via OK. Here Undo would
return to the original state before the dialog was opened. For
modeless dialogs he can even use Undo while the dialog is still open.
Here an Undo step is valid for the settings applied via Apply button.</SPAN></P>
<H2><A NAME="3.4.Live Mode Behavior|outline"></A>Live Mode Behavior</H2>
<P>In the Live mode the user can change the settings of the dialog as
usual. The only difference to the Normal mode is, that the changes
get directly visible in the document.</P>
<P>Whenever the focus is removed from a control, the settings should
get visible in the document as soon as possible. If the focus is not
changed from one control to another and the user changes something
within that single control, then the changes should get visible after
a defined time. This delay time is necessary to avoid fast screen
display changes due to hectic user actions. Whenever a change has
been made and no user's action takes place in this time, then the
settings get automatically visible in the document.</P>
<P>The delay time has to be verified, perhaps it should be about 2-3
seconds. The time might also be adjustable in a Tools/Options dialog.</P>
<H1><A NAME="4.Alternative: Preview Icon|outline"></A><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">Alternative:
Preview Icon</SPAN></H1>
<P>Instead of a Live mode that shows dialog changes automatically, it
is also possible to offer a Preview icon: When pressing it, all the
changes made in the dialog get directly visible in the document (but
they are not applied ultimately). The difference to the Live mode is,
that the user must be active to see the changes. 
</P>
<P>With this alternative technical problems that might occur with the
Live mode, such as time consuming data processing, are avoided.</P>
<H1><A NAME="5.Benefits to former Apply Proposal|outline"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Benefits
to former Apply Proposal</FONT></H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The button set has been reduced to a minimum to offer only
	the basic features that are necessary. Thus the problem of having
	too much buttons in a dialog, that might not be understandable,
	should not appear.</P>
	<LI><P>A Live or a Preview mode does not apply any settings to the
	object selection in the document. Therefore a user must not worry
	about how to undo changes. He just has to decide, if he wants to
	apply the current settings and then click on Apply (modeless) or OK
	(modal).</P>
</UL>
<H1><A NAME="6.Open Issues|outline"></A><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Open
Issues</B></FONT></H1>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Should a modal dialog contain an Apply button? This only
	makes sense to apply settings of an intermediary state, while
	&quot;playing&quot; with the dialog and trying out some settings. If
	yes, it should be tested, if the combination of OK/Apply is
	understood by a user.</P>
	<LI><P>Should a modeless dialog contain an OK button? This could
	make sense for offering the possibility to apply settings and close
	the dialog with just one mouse-click instead of two (=Apply +
	Close). If yes, it should be tested, if the combination of OK/Apply
	is easily understood by a user.</P>
	<LI><P>Is a Live mode, that shows changes automatically, better than
	a Preview button, that just displays the changes on the screen, when
	it is pressed by the user? (Technical problems that might appear
	with a Live mode must be cleared.)</P>
	<LI><P>Live mode: The names Live mode and Normal mode have to be
	verified (=&gt; Preview mode active/not active?)</P>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><B>Further Issues</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Independent of this proposal of a Live
mode or a Preview button, some issues are still open and are
summarized for the future:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>We need to establish functional button sets for use
	throughout our dialogs to avoid that users might be confused as to
	the behavior of the buttons (e.g. Reset, Back, Standard).</P>
	<LI><P>We need to establish window behavior, such as making sure all
	dialogs that can AND should be modeless, are modeless. This is to
	guarantee a faster workflow.</P>

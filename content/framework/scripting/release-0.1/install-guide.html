<h2>Downloading the Scripting Framework</h2>

The Scripting Framework is available for download in the form of a Jar 
file which can be obtained from <a href="SFrameworkInstall.jar">here</a>.
The contents of the Jar file are as follows:

<ul>
<li><b>installer</b> - A platform-independent installer for the Scripting
Framework written in Java.

<li><b>bindingdialog</b> - A collection of StarBasic dialogs
to enable the user to assign (bind) scripts written in Java to menu and
key items. This directory also contains the necessary XML files
for the menu items that invoke these StarBasic dialogs.

<li><b>examples</b> - Two example scripts written in Java.

<li><b>sframework</b> - A UNO package <!--<sup>*</sup>--> containing
the Scripting Framework libraries, Jar files and types.
Additionally, a resource file for a security-related dialog.

<li><b>ide</b> - The Jar files for NetBeans and jEdit integration.

<li><b>(platform dirs)</b> - These contain the platform dependent
<font face="Courier, monospace" size="2">regsingleton</font>
tool used to add singleton entries in the OpenOffice.org services datatbase.
</ul>

<a name="install"></a>

<h2>Installing the Scripting Framework</h2>

Before you begin installation, you need to ensure all Office processes 
have terminated and on Windows and Linux, that the QuickStarter
has been closed.  
<p>
To install the Scripting Framework:

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal (Linux/UNIX) or DOS Command Prompt (Windows)
<li>Ensure that java is in your execution path
<li>Copy the Scripting Framework Jar file you downloaded into the program
directory of the OpenOffice.org installation into which you
wish to install the Framework.
<li>Switch to the &lt;Office Installation&gt;/program directory
<li>Run the command:
<font face="Courier, monospace" size="2">java -jar SFrameworkInstaller.jar</font>
</ul>
         
<p>
This will cause the Scripting Framework to be installed in the
&lt;Office Installation&gt;/user/uno_packages directory of your Office
installation. If the installer detects an installation of either
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/ide/download.html"> NetBeans 3.4</a> or
<a href="http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download">jEdit 4.0.3</a>
you will be asked whether you wish to install the Scripting Framework
add-ins for these IDEs. These add-ins provide support for developing
and deploying Office Scripts in Java.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The installer detects IDE installations by looking for
session related files in the home directory of the user running the install,
so in order for your IDE to be detected you will need to have run it at
least once.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you are installing the Scripting Framework into a network
installed OpenOffice.org, the Framework install will need to be run as
the same user who did the initial network install.  This is because one of
the files (ProtocolHandler.xcu) that needs to be modified during the
Framework install is in the &lt;Office Installation&gt;/share directory,
<p>

<a name="uninstall"></a>

<h2>Uninstalling the Scripting Framework</h2>

Currently there is no automated process for uninstalling the Scripting
Framework, so uninstalling must be done manually (the process will be
automated in a future release).

<p>
To remove the Scripting Framework:
<ul>
<li>Delete the file &lt;Office Installation&gt;/user/uno_packages/ooscriptframe.zip
<li>Switch to the &lt;Office Installation&gt;/program directory and run the command: <font face="Courier, monospace" size="2">pkgchk</font>
</ul>

<p>
If you wish to remove any scripts from your installation they are stored in the directories:
<ul>
<li>&lt;Office Installation&gt;/user/Scripts
<li>&lt;Office Installation&gt;/share/Scripts
</ul>

<p>
You can use the Tools/Configure dialog to remove any menu or key bindings
that you have setup for Office scripts.

<p>
If you have installed Office Scripting support into a NetBeans installation
you can remove it by deleting:
<ul>
<li>&lt;NetBeans Installation&gt;/modules/office.jar
</ul>

<p>
If you have installed Office Scripting support into a jEdit installation
you can remove it by deleting:
<ul>
<li>&lt;jEdit Installation&gt;/jars/OfficeScripting.jar
<li>&lt;jEdit Installation&gt;/jars/idesupport.jar
</ul>

<H1>Known Issues in the Early Developer Release (Version 0.1)</H1>
<H2>Invocation</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Currently deployment and
	invocation of document scripts is not fully supported by the IDE and
	Tools/Assign Scripts dialog. Further releases will allow users to
	assign Menu and Keybinding to document scripts. [Refer to <A HREF="faq.html#4">FAQ
	question/answer 4</A> for details on how to do this manually.]</P>
</UL>
<H2>Binding</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Assign Script dialog which
	appears when you use the Tools/Assign Scripts (Java) menu item is
	for creating application level bindings only, you cannot create
	document bindings using this dialog. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Currently, bindings to Java
	scripts apply to either Writer or Calc, they cannot be applied
	across all OpenOffice.org applications, as can be done with Star
	Basic macros. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The Java script bindings are not integrated into the Star
	Basic Tools/Configure dialog at this time, so there may be
	inconsistencies between the bindings displayed in the Tools/Assign
	Scripts and the Tools/Configure dialogs, (For instance in the
	MemoryUtils example, the CTRL-Shift-M keybinding is not listed as a
	binding under the Tools/Assign script (Java)/Key... dialog, but is
	under the Tools/Configure/Keyboard tab)</P>
	<LI><P>You should not add menu bindings to the Format menu. If you
	do, it may cause any menu bindings you have created to disappear. If
	this happens you should reinstall the Scripting Framework to restore
	the Tools/Assign Scripts and Tools/Refresh User Scripts menu items.
	Future releases of the Scripting Framework will not allow menu
	bindings to be added to the Format menu. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Netbeans</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When using the Netbeans Scripting
	Framework support on Windows to Build/Configure a script parcel, the
	configure dialog sometimes does not contain any methods in the
	&ldquo;Available Methods&rdquo; panel. This problem is due to a bug
	in the plugin when building the classpath to introspect on the class
	files for the parcel recipie. The problem occurs if the unoil.jar is
	the last jar mounted.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">[Note: generally the unoil.jar from
	the installation is mounted automatically the first time you compile
	a parcel, therefore it is normally the last jar mounted. However,
	you will not see this jar in the NetBeans Explorer window as it is
	hidden].</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Workaround: After building a parcel
	recipie, in which you see the above problem occur, mount any other
	jar. This will be added after the hidden unoil.jar and the module
	will now function correctly.</P>
	<P></P>
</UL>
<H2>Linux</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">On Linux, you need to ensure that
	your DISPLAY environment variable is set to &lt;your hostname&gt;:0
	in the shell from which you start Office to work around a problem
	with Java GUIs causing Office to crash. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>On Linux (Red Hat) some issues were reported when installing
	the JEdit plugin to an existing JEdit installation. Deleting the
	.jedit directory from the user's home directory, restarting JEdit
	and then reinstalling the JEdit Scripting Framework support, solved
	the problem. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Solaris</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>When invoking key bindings on Solaris, you need to hit them
	twice to get first invocation, after that hit it once and it works. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Other</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There may be a slight delay in
	running the first script in Java after starting OpenOffice.org as
	the JVM is loaded. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The Framework does not currently support &quot;./&quot; in
	the classpath property in the parcel-descriptor.xml file. 
	</P>

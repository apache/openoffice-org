<h1>Features for Early Developer Release of the
Office Scripting Framework (Version 0.1)</h1>

<h2>Framework</h2>

Supports the loading of different language Runtimes to allow the
invocation of scripts written in a specific language. These scripts can
be deployed within the OpenOffice.org installation (user or share area)
or in a document. The current release provides a Java Runtime.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> IDE add-ins will only allow deployment of Java
scripts to the user area of an Office installation or to a document.

<h2>Language Runtime</h2>

The Java Runtime will dynamically load a Java script and any
supporting classes it requires, invoke the script and provide the script
with access to the current OpenOffice.org document which it can manipulate
using the Java UNO API.

<h2>IDE Add-ins</h2>

Integration modules for NetBeans and JEdit. The user can create a new Java
script parcel which contains one or more Java classes. They can export any
public methods from these classes as scripts, during deployment, as long
as the method takes a Scripting Context as its first parameter. Using
this Scripting Context object within these methods, they can access the
current OpenOffice.org document and use the Java UNO API to manipulate it.

<p>
By installing the ODK for OpenOffice.org, the user has full access to
online help and code completion within any scripts written in Java they
are writing.

<p>
The IDE fully supports debugging Java applications and as a result it is
possible to interactively debug your OpenOffice.org scripts written in
Java. Just set a breakpoint, bind to the running JVM in OpenOffice.org,
invoke the script in this OpenOffice.org and step through the code in the
IDE. For more information on setting up OpenOffice.org to enable debugging
see:

<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/man/IDEintegration/OfficeNetBeansIntegration.html#Debugging">Debugging Java components in NetBeans/Forte for Java</a>
<p>

<h2>Binding</h2>

Ability to assign scripts written in Java to menu and key bindings
from OpenOffice.org Tools/Assign Script menu (invokes a custom Assign
dialog written in StarBasic)

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Bindings are stored in the application configuration settings
from the Assign dialog . The cannot be stored directly in a document.

<h2>Security</h2>

Security in the Early Developer Release will be provided in the form of a
nag dialog which will be popped up every time a user attempts to run a
script from within a document. The nag dialog is not displayed when
invoking application scripts deployed to the user or share area.

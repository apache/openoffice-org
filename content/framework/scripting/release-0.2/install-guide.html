<h2>Downloading the Scripting Framework</h2>

The Scripting Framework is available for download in the form of a Jar 
file which can be obtained from <a href="SFrameworkInstall.jar">here</a>.
The contents of the Jar file are as follows:

<ul>
<li><b>installer</b> - A platform-independent installer for the Scripting
Framework written in Java.

<li><b>bindingdialog</b> - A collection of StarBasic dialogs
to enable the user to assign (bind) scripts to menu and key items,
and to document and application events. This directory also contains
the necessary XML files for the menu items that invoke these StarBasic dialogs.

<li><b>examples</b> - Example scripts written in Java and BeanShell.

<li><b>sframework</b> - A UNO package <!--<sup>*</sup>--> containing
the Scripting Framework libraries, Jar files and types.

<li><b>ide</b> - The Jar files for NetBeans integration.

</ul>

<!--
<p>
<sup>*</sup>See <a href="http://api.openoffice.org/servlets/ProjectDownloadList?action=download&amp;dlID=84">
&sect;4.7.1</a> of the

<h2>Installing the Scripting Framework</h2>

Before you begin installation, you need to ensure all Office processes 
have terminated and on Windows and Linux, that the QuickStarter
has been closed. <br> 

<br>
<b>Note:</b> Before installing an updated version of the Scripting Framework, the previous version should be removed. (See the <a href="uninstall-guide.html">Guide for Uninstalling</a>) 

<p>
To install the Scripting Framework:

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal (Linux/UNIX) or DOS Command Prompt (Windows)
<li>Ensure that java is in your execution path
<li>Run the command:
<font face="Courier, monospace" size="2">java -jar SFrameworkInstall.jar</font>
</ul>

<p>
This will start the installer GUI, which you can use to select the Office
installation to which you want to install the Scripting Framework. The
framework is installed in the &lt;Office Installation&gt;/user/uno_packages
directory of the Office installation you choose.

If the installer detects an installation of either
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/devhome/docs/releases/builds_archive/release_archive.html"> NetBeans 3.4</a>
you will be asked whether you wish to install the IDE Add-ins.
These add-ins provide support for developing and deploying Office Scripts.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> If you do not wish to use the GUI you can install the
Scripting Framework and the IDE Add-in via the command line using the command:

<p>
<font face="Courier, monospace" size="2">
java -jar SFrameworkInstall.jar -office &lt;Office Installation&gt;
-netbeans &lt;NetBeans Installation&gt;</font>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The installer detects IDE installations by looking for
session related files in the home directory of the user running the install,
so in order for your IDE to be detected you will need to have run it at
least once.

<h1>New Features in this Release</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Additional language support</b>

<p>
Added support for <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/home.html">BeanShell</a>, a loosely typed Java based scripting language
supported by NetBeans.  The Interactive BeanShell Scripting Window
available from Tools-&gt;Scripting Add-ons allows you to experiment
with Office scripting without needing to recompile your scripts.

<p>
This is an example of the implementation of an additional script runtime,
in this case based on Java runtime (see
<a href="runtime-howto.html">How to write a runtime</a> for more information
on writing runtimes).

<li><p><b>Security Enhancements</b>

<p>
Script execution by the scripting framework now honors the <a href="user-guide.html#Leveraging_StarBasic_Security">security</a>
settings in Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Security Settings. (ie. your existing
settings for StarBasic macros).

<li><p><b>Support for storage of bindings in documents</b>

<p>
With this release script bindings can now also be stored in documents
as well as in your OpenOffice.org user directory (see the <a href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for instructions).

<li><p><b>Support for Event Bindings</b>

<p>
<a href="user-guide.html#bindscripts">Assign dialogs</a> have been enhanced to allow bindings to events as well
as to menu items and keys.
</ul>

<p><b>Notes:</b>

<ul>
<li>New binding assignments can be made without requiring a restart of
OpenOffice.org
<li>Scripts bindings are now fully resolved at binding
<li>Command line utilities have been added for packaging and deployment
(see <a href="commandline-devguide.html">
Developing Scripts without an IDE</a>)
<li>Support for jEdit IDE has been discontinued
</ul>

<h1>Features of the Office Scripting Framework</h1>
  
<h2>Scripting Framework</h2>

Enables Office scripting in a language of your choice through support for
different language Runtimes. The current release provides Java and
BeanShell Runtimes. The Scripting Framework is designed to allow Runtimes
for other languages (for which a UNO bridge exists) to be developed and
deployed easily. Runtimes for Java based languages use the Java UNO bridge.

<h2>Script Development and IDE support</h2>

A NetBeans module is provided which can be used to create Office scripts.
Scripts can be deployed to a document or to an OpenOffice.org
installation (user or share area). By installing the ODK for
OpenOffice.org, the user has full access to online help and code
completion within any scripts they are writing.

<p>
Debugging of scripts is possible in NetBeans for Java scripts. For
more information on setting up OpenOffice.org to enable debugging see
<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/man/IDEintegration/OfficeNetBeansIntegration.html#Debugging">
Debugging Java components in NetBeans/Forte for Java</a>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The BeanShell scripting language does not support source
level debugging it is not possible to debug Office scripts written
in BeanShell from NetBeans.  It is recommended to use the Interactive
BeanShell Scripting Window when developing while BeanShell scripts.

<h2>Executing Scripts</h2>

Scripts can be executed from key combinations, selecting menu item
or events (document or application). Assign dialogs (written in StarBasic)
allow the user to bind scripts available in document or OpenOffice.org
installation to key combination, menu items or events (document or
application).  Bindings can be stored in documents or an OpenOffice.org
installation.

<h2>Security</h2>

The security settings of the Scripting Framework honor the existing
StarBasic security settings available in Tools -&gt; Options -&gt;
Security Settings.

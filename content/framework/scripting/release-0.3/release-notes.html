<h1>Release Notes</h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The installer now takes some optional command line arguments:</p>
    <pre style="margin-bottom: 0.51cm;"> java -jar SFrameworkInstall.jar [-office &lt;path_to_office_installation&gt;]<br> [-netbeans &lt;path_to_netbeans_installation&gt;]<br> [-net] [-bindings]<br> [-help]</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are installing the framework on the windows platform (
for language other than english ) you may experience difficulties, the
installer looks for the sversion.ini file in either the user's home
directory or in the &#8220;Application Data&#8221; sub-directory of the user's
home directory. To install the framework copy the sversion.ini file to
the user's home directory or to the &#8220;Application Data&#8221; sub-directory in
the user's home. (Note: you may need to create the sub-directory called
&#8220;Application Data&#8221;)</p>
  </li>
  <li>The problem with installing the 0.3 release in StarOffice has
been fixed as of 15 July 2003.</li>
  <li>Installing the Scripting Framework in a
network (ie. setup -net) installation is currently broken, this will be rectified as soon as possible.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Script Binding</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It is important the only the "Assign
Script To ..." dialogs are used to create &amp; delete script
bindings for Scripting framework Java &amp; Beanshell scripts. While
these bindings also appear in the Tools-&gt;Configure dialog, that
dialog should <b>not </b>be used to delete these bindings as the
results are undefined and may lead to a loss of all menu items! In a
future release, both these dialogs will be integrated, resolving this
issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">&#8220;Assign Script to ..&#8221; dialogs work
only for the following applications, writer, calc, impress, draw and
presentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The Languages displayed in the
&#8220;Language&#8221; combo-box for all &#8220;Assign Script to ...&#8221; menus is populated
with &#8220;Java&#8221; by default and then with the corresponding languages for
any associated installed runtimes. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Given that Control-Shift-Digit key
combinations are not available to OpenOffice.org on all platforms,
these bindings are not supported by the Scripting framework. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The scripting framework contains a
number of helper scripts for its own use. Logical names starting with
an underscore followed by a dollar sign and a script name, eg.
"_$HelperScript" are reserved for this purpose, and will not be
displayed in the assign dialogs. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font color="#000000">In order to
save a script event binding to a menu item or key into a document there
are two steps which must be followed. Firstly, set up the binding in
the usual way using the "Assign Script To ..." dialog. Then
open the Tools-&gt;Configure dialog, and select the "Menu" tab. Click
the "Save" button, select the document into which you wish to save the
binding, and click "Save".&nbsp; You will be prompted with a dialog
that says "The file already exists. Overwrite?". It is OK to click
"Yes" as this will simply write the bindings into the file. Saving a
binding to an event into a document can be done by clicking the
"Document" radio button in the "Assign Script to Event" dialog.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In both the Writer &amp; Calc
applications, the Format menu is dynamically generated. For this reason
the Scripting Framework does not allow the user to bind scripts
to entries in the Format menu in any of the applications. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It is not possible to assign scripts
to menus, keys or events in Web or Formula documents (only Writer,
Calc, Impress &amp; Draw). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Currently the Scripting Framework
does not prevent the user from duplicating menu entries, for example it
is possible to create a second "New" menu entry under the "File"
menu. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The Comboboxes in the "Assign Script
To ..." dialogs are not read-only. Editing their contents will
prevent the generation of script bindings and will result in a
StarBasic error message being displayed. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not possible to create top-level menus from the "Assign
Script to Menu" dialog. However, the following steps will create a new
top-level menu which can then be used in the "Assign Script To Menu"
dialog. Open the Tools-&gt;Configure dialog, collapse the top-level
menu entry preceding&nbsp; the location where the new top-level menu
entry is to be placed and click the "New Menu" button. The new menu
"Menu" will be placed below the highlighted menu item. Left clicking
this entry, pausing, and left-clicking again (ie. not a double-click),
will allow the user to rename the menu. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The user/Scripts directory should
not be moved or deleted as it contains scripts (in the
java/ScriptfrmwrkHelper directory) that are used by the Scripting
Framework (in the creation of script bindings). While the NetBeans
deploy will re-create a missing user/Scripts directory it does not
restore the helper scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Binding a script to the "Close Application" event may cause
openOffice to crash, and where this does not happen the script fails to
run. This bug is being tracked by <a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/project/www/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=15726">issue
15726</a>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Script Security</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Security warning dialogs are
displayed upon first invocation, and not on document load as is done
for StarBasic. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the security setting is "Always", and "Show Warning Before
Running" the Scripting Framework displays the correct dialog. StarBasic
displays a dialog more appropriate to "According To Path List", and
while this issue has been fixed (<a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=11822">Issue
11822</a>) the fix is not present in OpenOffice.org 1.1 beta.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>IDE &amp; Deployment</h2>
<ul>
</ul>

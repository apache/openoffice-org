<h2>New Features in Release 0.3</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">JavaScript/Rhino runtime<br>
    <br>
    </span>This release includes a JavaScript Script runtime based on <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> (used under the <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">Mozilla Public License</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Enhanced Debugging support for
BeanShell &amp; JavaScript scripts<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;">The Tools-&gt;Scripting Add-ons
menu now contains a new item <a href="user-guide.html#editdebug">"Edit/Debug
Scripts"</a>, that allows the user to edit and debug BeanShell &amp;
JavaScript scripts.&nbsp; This required a modification to the Rhino
class org.mozilla.javascript.tools.debugger.Main. These modifications
are included in the Jar file, and are also available via the <a
 href="http://framework.openoffice.org/source/browse/framework/scripting/examples/java/debugger/rhino/Main.java">source
browser</a>.<br>
    </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for filesystem scripts<br>
    <br>
    </span>Users can bind to and run BeanShell &amp; Javacript scripts
located at any point on their <a href="user-guide.html#filesys">filesystem</a>.
These scripts do not need to have an associated parcel-descriptor.xml.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>New Features in Release 0.2<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Additional language support</b> </p>
    <p> Added support for <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/home.html">BeanShell</a>,
a loosely typed Java based scripting language supported by NetBeans.
The Interactive BeanShell Scripting Window available from
Tools-&gt;Scripting Add-ons allows you to experiment with Office
scripting without needing to recompile your scripts. </p>
    <p> This is an example of the implementation of an additional
script
runtime, in this case based on Java runtime (see <a
 href="runtime-howto.html">How to write a runtime</a> for more
information on writing runtimes). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Security Enhancements</b> </p>
    <p> Script execution by the scripting framework now honors the <a
 href="user-guide.html#Leveraging_StarBasic_Security">security</a>
settings in Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Security Settings. (ie. your
existing settings for StarBasic macros). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Support for storage of bindings in documents</b> </p>
    <p> With this release script bindings can now also be stored in
documents as well as in your OpenOffice.org user directory (see the <a
 href="release-notes.html">release notes</a> for instructions). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Support for Event Bindings</b> </p>
    <p> <a href="user-guide.html#bindscripts">Assign dialogs</a> have
been enhanced to allow bindings to events as well as to menu items and
keys. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>New binding assignments can be made without requiring a restart
of OpenOffice.org </li>
  <li>Scripts bindings are now fully resolved at binding </li>
  <li>Command line utilities have been added for packaging and
deployment (see <a href="commandline-devguide.html"> Developing
Scripts
without an IDE</a>) </li>
  <li>Support for jEdit IDE has been discontinued </li>
</ul>
<h2>Features of the Office Scripting Framework</h2>
<h2>Scripting Framework</h2>
Enables Office scripting in a language of your choice through support
for different language Runtimes. The current release provides Java and
BeanShell Runtimes. The Scripting Framework is designed to allow
Runtimes for other languages (for which a UNO bridge exists) to be
developed and deployed easily. Runtimes for Java based languages use
the
Java UNO bridge.
<h2>Script Development and IDE support</h2>
A NetBeans module is provided which can be used to create Office
scripts. Scripts can be deployed to a document or to an OpenOffice.org
installation (user or share area). By installing the ODK for
OpenOffice.org, the user has full access to online help and code
completion within any scripts they are writing.
<p> Debugging of scripts is possible in NetBeans for Java scripts. For
more information on setting up OpenOffice.org to enable debugging see <a
 href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/man/IDEintegration/OfficeNetBeansIntegration.html#Debugging">
Debugging Java components in NetBeans/Forte for Java</a> </p>
<p> <b>Note:</b> The BeanShell scripting language does not support
source level debugging it is not possible to debug Office scripts
written in BeanShell from NetBeans. It is recommended to use the
Interactive BeanShell Scripting Window when developing while BeanShell
scripts. </p>
<h2>Executing Scripts</h2>
Scripts can be executed from key combinations, selecting menu item or
events (document or application). Assign dialogs (written in StarBasic)
allow the user to bind scripts available in document or OpenOffice.org
installation to key combination, menu items or events (document or
application). Bindings can be stored in documents or an OpenOffice.org
installation.
<h2>Security</h2>
The security settings of the Scripting Framework honor the existing
StarBasic security settings available in Tools -&gt; Options -&gt;
Security Settings. <br>

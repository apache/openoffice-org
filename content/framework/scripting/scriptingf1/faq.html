	<LI><P><A NAME="1"></A><B>What is the OpenOffice.org Scripting Framework?</B>
	<P>The Scripting Framework is a project to allow users of OpenOffice.org
     to write scripts to automate commonly performed tasks in a language
     of their choice.
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><A HREF="#top">Top</A> 

	<LI><P><A NAME="2"></A><B>Why are you developing the OpenOffice.org Scripting Framework?</B>
	<P>The Scripting Framework is a project to allow users of OpenOffice.org
     to write scripts to automate commonly performed tasks in a language
     of their choice.
  <P>There are currently two ways for users and developers to add
     functionality to OpenOffice.org, namely macros and UNO components. </p>
  <P>Macros are a set of instructions which OpenOffice.org can interpret
     at runtime to carry out a specific set of tasks in OpenOffice.org. Users
     can create a macro by recording a number of tasks in OpenOffice.org,
     save this set of tasks as a macro and then bind this macro to a menu or
     keypress. The macro is run by hitting the bound menu or key. Advanced
     users can write their own StarBasic macros in an embedded StarBasic IDE
     if they wish. </p>
  <P>UNO components are compiled C++ or Java components, which a
     developer can write using the UNO API to access and manipulate
     OpenOffice.org. The component is written in an external IDE in C++ or
     Java (or any language with a supported UNO bridge). The end user needs
     to install any new component in their OpenOffice.org to make use of this
     new functionality. UNO component development is supported by the ODK. </p>
  <P>The Scripting Framework aims to strike a balance between these two
     approaches of customizing OpenOffice.org. The framework will allow
     scripts to be written in a variety of languages, deployed into
     OpenOffice.org installations or documents, loaded at runtime and
     executed in OpenOffice.org. The framework will allow any number of
     different scripting languages to be plugged into OpenOffice.org for
     which there is an UNO bridge. Our focus will be to support languages
     with a Java implementation, but the framework can be made to work with
     any scripting langauge with a supported UNO bridge such as the UNO
     Python bridge. In this way users and developers will be able to write

	<LI><P><A NAME="3"></A><B>In what release of OpenOffice.org will the
  Scripting Framework be released?</B>
	<P>The Scripting Framework will be released as part of OpenOffice.org 2.0. In
  the meantime completed features will be made available via developer builds.

	<LI><P><A NAME="4"></A><B>Why is there a delay in starting the first script?</B>
	<P>The delay is caused by the startup of the inprocess JVM by OpenOffice.org.

	Script Framework installation and installed my own but the script in
	ExampleSpreadSheet.sxc still works. Why? </B>
	</P>
	<P>Both the script and the Key bindings are contained in the document
     itself.

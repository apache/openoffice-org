<H1>Planned Features for the OpenOffice.org Scripting Framework</H1>

<H2>Redesign of the Tools/Configure dialog</H2>
<P>
The current Tools/Configure dialog is not very usable. A
<a href="http://specs.openoffice.org/scripting_framework/index.html">
specification</a> is being completed for the complete redesign of this dialog.

<H2>ScriptProviderForPython</H2>
<P>
Joerg Budischewski has provided UNO bindings for Python and has done some
work on making a ScriptRuntime available for a previous version of the
Scripting Framework. This ScriptRuntime needs to be updated to support the
new Scripting Framework architecture so users can create OpenOffice.org
scripts in Python.

<H2>Make OpenOffice.org dialogs available to all scripting languages</H2>
<P>
Currently dialogs created by the OpenOffice.org Basic dialog editor
can only be instantiated using the Basic CreateUNODialog function. In the
next milestone it should be possible to instantiate these dialogs from other
languages.</P>

<H2>Digital Signing Support</H2>
<P>
The intention is to use digital signing of script parcels to give
a higher degree of security for OpenOffice.org users of these new
language scripts. The Scripting Framework will be enhanced to verify
the digital signatures of scripts before they are executed.
Appropriate configuration settings could be added so users can
control script execution.</P>

<H2>Common Packaging Format</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
We will move to a common packaging format for UNO components, OpenOffice.org
scripts, and OpenOffice.org Basic macros. 
</P>

All suggestions for further features welcome on dev@framework.openoffice.org
or in IssueZilla under category framework, subcategory scripting.

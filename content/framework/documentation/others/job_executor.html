<P CLASS="western"><BR>Inside the office exist a special service
com.sun.star.task.JobExecutor.  He can be used to trigger special
events for which some uno components can be registered. Such
components must provide the interfaces com.sun.star.task.XJob &ndash;
for synchronous job execution &ndash; or com.sun.star.task.XAsyncJob
&ndash; for asnychronous job execution. The global executor knows all
these registered jobs and her possible trigger events by using a

configuration.</P>

for this event. These strings are the same like the entries of the
job list &ndash; not the service names.</P>

<H1 CLASS="western">How it works</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Some code inside the office detect a special event
&ndash; e.g. first visible document frame was opened. He creates the
global job executor service and call him with a string value which
descibe the event. The executor searches for any registered job
inside his configuration which is registered for this event and not
disabled. To check that two time stamps AdminTime and UserTime are
used. (see before). After creation he queries the job component for
the required interface and start it. Possible configuration data are
passed to the job before. The job does his work then and return. At
this time he must decide if he whish to be active and whish to be
deactivated for further occurences of this event. He can do that by
using a special protocol packed inside the returned Any value. A list
of com.sun.star.beans.NamedValue is required there. Following values
are supported:</P>

<P CLASS="western">If a job will be a synchronous one &ndash; he
shouldn't show any UI during his execution. Because nobody knows the

can produce many trouble if the come at wrong time.</P>

<P CLASS="western">Example</P>
<P CLASS="western">Following sequence diagram shows an example job
which is triggered for an &bdquo;event1&ldquo;. He gets his own
configuration data which includes a &bdquo;count&ldquo; value. The
job increased and checked it. In case of &bdquo;count==1&ldquo; he
knows that it was the first execution and he invite the job executor
to save some configuration data for it &ndash; which means especialy
the count value. But the job shouldn't be deactivated. If next
&bdquo;event1&ldquo; is triggered the job is started again and gets
his count information. He found out that it was the second execution
and decide to be deactivated from now. He invite the job executor and
this service deactivate it inside the configuration.</P>

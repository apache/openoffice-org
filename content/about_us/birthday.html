<h4>Preface: About this page</h4>
<p>One year ago, Sun open-sourced the code to StarOffice. So, today, 2001 October 
  13, is our birthday. To honor this day and the community who have made OpenOffice.org 
  such a success, we have put together pages of our accomplishments, features 
  (of the code), stories, testimonials, and more.</p> 
<p>The links below represent only a portion of what we can boast of this, our 
  first birthday. And if you have any suggestions for things to add, please send 
  them to <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org</a>.</p>

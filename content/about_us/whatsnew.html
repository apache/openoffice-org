<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align=left>OpenOffice.org 1.0 is a
full featured office suite that does more than you might expect. This
is a quick rundown of new features added since the StarOffice code
was made open source.</p>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" align=left><br><br>
</p>
<h3 class="western"><b>Differences between StarOffice and
OpenOffice.org</b> 
</h3>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The source
code available at OpenOffice.org does not consist of all of the
StarOffice code. This is because Sun Microsystems, Inc. pays to
license third party code to include in StarOffice that it does not
have permission to make available in OpenOffice.org. Those things
which are or will be present in StarOffice but are not available on
OpenOffice.org include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	Certain
	fonts, especially <span lang="en-GB"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Asian</font></span>
	language fonts, are not included,</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	The
	database component (Adabas D) is not included. The OpenOffice.org
	community is working on a way to use any database you want in the
	<a href="/project/dba/">Database Access Component</a>,</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	Some
	templates and an extensive Clip Art Gallery,</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	The
	<span lang="en-GB"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Asian</font></span>
	versions of OpenOffice.org lack some of the same sorting
	functionality,</p>
	<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	Certain
	file filters such as WordPerfect. There is a community project
	underway at the moment to write Open Source filters for including in
	OpenOffice.org: http://www.ooodocs.org/article.php?sid=21
	.<br><br>
	</p>
</ul>
<p lang="en-GB" class="western">For more information on the current
features of OpenOffice.org, please see the features page at
<a href="//dev_docs/source/features.html">//dev_docs/source/features.html</a>
.</p>
<div id="Last Build">
	<h2 class="western">Changes since the Last OpenOffice.org build:</h2>
	<h3 class="western">All Applications</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">As described in
		<a href="http://framework.openoffice.org/proposals/macro_security/security_enhancements.html">http://framework.openoffice.org/proposals/macro_security/security_enhancements.html</a>
		the security settings have been enhanced. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">To clarify, the security
		related setting checkbox for warning on executing macros was
		removed from the event configuration tab; it is now part of the tab
		for security settings.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Butterfly-icons (used for
		StarOffice) are now changed almost everywhere to OpenOffice.org's
		own gull-icons.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The tab for setting key
		bindings (pressing a combination of keys to perform an action,
		e.g., Ctrl+S=Save) now has two radio buttons to switch between
		common bindings for all OpenOffice.org components and (if defined)
		component specific key bindings.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">There is a new syntax for
		selecting a different printer on the command line: <br>	-pt
		&lt;printer name&gt; &lt;file 1&gt; &lt;file 2&gt; ... &lt;file n&gt;
		<br>where <br>	-pt is the print-to command, &lt;printer name&gt; is
		the name of a printer, and &lt;file 1..n&gt; is a list of files
		separated with blanks. If filenames contain blanks, they have to be
		enclosed in double quotation marks (i.e., &quot;my document&quot;).
				</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The Basic password
		functionality now has been reimplemented for the new basic library
		container concept. Apart from some minor changes, it should look
		the same as in StarOffice 5.2. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Basic libraries, both in
			applications and documents can again be password protected. If the
			password is not known, they cannot be edited but nevertheless can
			be used. Unlike the old implementation they're not all scrambled
			with a single key but with a key derived from the password. So
			there's no chance to read the source if the user forgets the
			password. 
			</p>
			<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">If a StarOffice 5.x document
			contains password protected Basic libraries the password is
			imported and the library will be scrambled with this password when
			the document is saved in OpenOffice.org format (it's the same as
			if the user had assigned this password by hand). 
			</p>
			<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">If an OpenOffice.org document
			contains password protected Basic libraries and the password was
			not typed in correctly by the user then the source cannot be
			exported. The 5.x document then will only contain empty Basic
			modules with a simple hint text describing the problem. If the
			password is entered correctly, the library will be exported
			correctly to the 5.x document. But the user must be aware that
			neither the password protected library nor the password are really
			secure; as it is possible to read the data by debugging
			OpenOffice.org. 
			</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Under Linux the margins in
		spadmin Properties-&gt;Other Settings are now absolute values in
		mm.rather than inches. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="western">Database Access</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The standard setting for &quot;Open
	in design mode&quot; in forms has changed from &quot;On&quot; to
	&quot;Off&quot;. 
	</p>
	<h3 class="western">OpenOffice.org Draw and Impress</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The pack feature has been
		removed from the Impress application. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The Outliner only uses the font
		valid on the first position in the paragraph, not the font from
		stylesheet / para attributes. For a bullet only the height is used,
		while for numbering, all attributes except Underline, Strikeout,
		Emphasismark, and Relief are used. This means, for instance, that
		the bullet height changes after typing the first character in the
		paragraph or after selecting another size. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="western">OpenOffice.org Writer</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Groups of drawing objects can
		be named in writer. If one grouped object is selected the menu
		entry &quot;Name object&quot; in the context menu and in the format
		menu below the entry &quot;Position and size&quot; is available.
		Additionally, all named drawing objects appear in the navigator.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">AltLinux has donated code to
		support the hyphenator for OpenOffice.org. Hyphenation dictionaries
		are now available and integrated into OOo 1.0 for English, Danish,
		German, and Russian with more coming for later releases. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="western">OpenOffice.org Calc</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">It is now possible to name an
		OLE object (such as a chart). The context menu  (usually availalbe
		by clicking with the right mouse button) for objects has an
		additional entry &quot;Name Object&quot;.</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">If an object has a UI name,
		that name is shown in the Navigator instead of the internal name
		(&quot;Object x&quot;). The UI name is also kept when cutting &amp;
		pasting an object. Therefore, the name is not unique, there can be
		several objects with the same name in a document. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western"><br><br>
	</p>
	<h3 class="western">Installation</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">To enable or disable the migration
	during a response file installation it is possible to use a new key
	within the environment section: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">[ENVIRONMENT]<br>MIGRATION = YES |
		NO</p>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The default is NO. If the key is
		set to YES the migration is only executed in case an old version is
		found.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">When trying a network
		installation (setup -net) under UNIX without having root
		permissions, a message box will appear warning the user that some
		steps of the installation may fail, and the option to cancel the
		installation process is offered. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Under Solaris the system wide
		CDE integration is now for the language of the office installation
		<b>and</b> for the C locale. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Under Solaris you can retrieve
		system wide CDE panel integration (for the office language only!),
		if the following preconditions are met: 
		</p>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">- network installation (setup
		-net)<br>- the CDE integration module must be selected (which is
		default on Solaris)<br>- root permissions</p>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">For a standalone installation, the
		user $HOME integration will take place. The same will happen as a
		fallback if the installer doesn't have root permissions, or when a
		user starts the workstation setup in a locale of a language
		different from the office installation. 
		</p>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">After the network installation has
		finished successfully, all users logging on the same machine with a
		locale corresponding to the language of the office installation
		will find the StarOffice/StarSuite panel submenu already present. 
		</p>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Upon clicking a starter icon a
		dialog appears asking to complete or repair the workstation
		installation. 
		</p>
		<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The reason why the integration is
		done only for the language the office installation is in, is that
		this way one can install multiple office suite installations on one
		machine and the user will allways find starter icons for the office
		in his/her login language. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Double-clicking on an MS Office
		document or template should open OpenOffice.org loaded with this
		document or the template, respectively. Furthermore, OpenOffice.org
		is registered as the default HTML Editor. Under Windows, this
		behaviour can be switched off. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="western"><span style="text-decoration: none">General User
	Interface</span> 
	</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">To make things simpler, the
		filters &quot;WordPerfect (Win) 6.0&quot;, &quot;WordPerfect (Win)
		6.1&quot; and &quot;WordPerfect (Win) 7.0&quot; have been grouped
		together, now forming a single entry in the 'File Open' dialog,
		&quot;WordPerfect (Win) 6.0 - 7.0&quot;. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">After changing all Japanese
		resource strings from half width to full width, the new release
		will be almost always capable of showing these relatively long
		strings in all dialogs without clipping. - Exceptions (that are not
		yet changed) are:<br>- Writer/Insert table - Button AutoFormat<br>-
		Writer/Insert indexes/Page Entries - Buttons EntryText and
		Hyperlink<br>- Writer/Insert Frame/Wrap - One ImageRadioButton is
		slightly clipped.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Filter groups, a list of all
		filters for writer, calc, writer/web, etcetera, are now sorted
		according to the global categories (&quot;text documents&quot;,
		&quot;spreadsheets&quot;, etc.) at the top of the filter list,
		again to try and make things simpler and more consistent.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Smart detection of changes in
		the template structure: 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">OpenOffice.org allows you to
			specify a list of folders where document templates are located
			(Tools/Options). However, to speed things up the information is
			not updated unless you use the supplied
			&quot;File/Templates/Organize/Commands/Update&rdquo; mechanism. If
			this is not updated then all of the dialogs that present template
			information are out-of-date. 
			</p>
			<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">In this release, a mechanism
			has been added to check if the template folders and the
			configuration entries are in sync. This mechanism is used in the
			&quot;Organize templates dialog&quot; as well as in the old &quot;New
			from template&quot; dialog (which, for instance, is still used in
			Draw/Impress when loading a slide design). It allows to
			automatically perform the (expensive) update when necessary. Thus,
			when using the dialogs mentioned, they are now always up-to-date
			when opened - even if the user modified the templates structure
			without using OOo at all. 
			</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">When selecting a path in &quot;Tools
		- Options &ndash; OpenOffice.org - Security&quot;, a dialogue is
		now available to select archive files (*.jar, *.zip) instead of
		folders. It is possible to add folders manually by editing the edit
		field.

<div id="Since OS">
	<h2 class="western">Changes Since OpenOffice.org went Open Source:</h2>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Online Help, English Spellchecker
	and Thesaurus now available, plus various other spellcheckers are
	available! 
	</p>
	<h3 class="western">Database Access</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Under specific conditions,
		database forms now try to share their connections. Database (sub)
		forms also share connections.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">For all file system based data
		source types (namely <span lang="en-GB"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">dBase</font></span>,
		file, and Spreadsheet), the URLs displayed in the dialog are
		decoded, for example, for a <span lang="en-GB"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">dBase</font></span>
		data source based on the files in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&quot;c:\some
		where</font>&quot;, the correct SDBC API URL would be
		&quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">sdbc:<span lang="en-GB">dbase</span>:file://c|/some%20where</font>&quot;.
		But now the dialog displayes &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">sdbc:<span lang="en-GB">dbase</span>:file://c|/some
		where</font>&quot;. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">New auto pilot for integrating
		system address books / stocks. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Data source administration
		dialog: file system based SDBC urls displayed in a decoded version
		now. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Changed runtime representation
		of form (control) macros. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">You can now rename
		tables,views, and queries.</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="western">All Applications</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">To benefit from the
		anti-aliasing options provided by the Graphics System under UNIX
		there are new options under Tools &ndash; Options -View. There's an
		additional check box &quot;Screen Font Anti-aliasing&quot;, and a
		field where a pixel limit for the anti-aliasing can be specified. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Ability to insert a special
		character such as <font face="Times New Roman, serif">&reg;:</font>
		&ldquo;Insert - Special Character&rdquo; added.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The temporary base directory
		can be configured by a user. The office creates its own temporary
		directories/files beneath this base directory.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The new File Save dialogs allow
		saving with password only for OpenOffice.org XML file format.</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">When the next document of the
		same type is created or opened, it gets the same window state as
		stored in the configuration. So you can have different default
		window sizes for every module in OpenOffice.org. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Transparency color controls at
		the 'Fade object' TabPage of 'Interaction' dialog have been
		removed. These controls are not needed anymore, because all
		necessary transparency calculations are made internally now. 
		</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">The SDBC driver for accessing
		address data from various data sources (including address data of
		an existing Mozilla installation) now uses a configuration setting
		to determine which Mozilla profile should be used to log on to
		Mozilla.</p>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western">Now the attributes listbox of
		the Find &amp; Replace dialogue (only available if the writer is
		the current application) contains <span lang="en-GB"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Asian</font></span>
		and other new attributes. &ldquo;Edit - Find &amp; Replace&rdquo;</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="text-decoration: none">Help
		on Basic implemented. When the Basic IDE is open and the cursor on
		one word, when you press &lt;F1&gt; the help application tries to
		open a page matching to this word. 
		</p>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="western">OpenOffice.org Draw and Impress</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">Some names for presentation and
	interaction effects have been changed: <br>Object effects:</p>

	<h2 class="western"><b>What's new since StarOffice 5.2?</b></h2>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">The program has undergone some
	significant changes since StarOffice 5.2 was released. Some of these
	changes are: 
	</p>
	<h3 class="western">Removal of integrated desktop</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">	The integrated desktop, which
	allowed you to run your whole computer  has been removed. It is
	replaced by individual component modules such as Writer and Impress.
	In Windows versions of the program you can access these quickly
	using the Quick Start Menu. This was changed so we didn't force our
	own desktop on users. 
	</p>
	<h3 class="western">Componentization of word processing,
	spreadsheet, and graphic application modules 
	</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">	The old StarOffice used the
	integrated desktop and all of the included applications had to use
	the same windows and icons. The new component architechture means
	that each application can concentrate on doing what it does best
	whilst still remaining an integral part of the complete
	OpenOffice.org suite.</p>
	<h3 class="western">Removal of email and calendar and the schedule
	server 
	</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	For
	copyright reasons the email and calendar features (known as
	'Groupware') were removed from the code. However a project to put
	them back in has been started. More information is availiable at:
	<a href="http://groupware.openoffice.org/">http://groupware.openoffice.org/</a>
	.</p>
	<h3 class="western">Removal of the browser 
	</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	There
	are plenty of excellent Open Source web browsers such as the Mozilla
	Project. It was felt that duplicating this effort was a waste and
	that we should concentrate on the Office features of the
	OpenOffice.org suite.</p>
	<h3 class="western">Move to XML-file formats 
	</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	XML is a
	way of describing structured information, like the highlighting in
	text documents, in an efficient and open way. The new OpenOffice.org
	file formats are much smaller than those of similar suites.</p>
	<h3 class="western">Improved Microsoft filters</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">	Most
	people currently use Microsoft Office so excellent compatibility is
	a must. OpenOffice.org provides filters so that even the most
	complex features are usually decoded.</p>
	<h3 class="western"><b><font size=4><font face="Albany, sans-serif">Asian</font></font></b>
	language Support</h3>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">	Chinese (simple and traditional),
	Japanese, and Korean are just a few of the languages that have been
	added; check out the localisation project for more details:
	http://l10n.openoffice.org/</p>
	<p lang="en-GB" class="western">These are all changes that were
	decided upon by Sun Microsystems before the source code was released
	to the community.

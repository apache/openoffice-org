  <p class="Header">MAC OS X PORT OF OPENOFFICE.ORG FOR X11 IS NOW OFFICIALLY
    GOLDEN MASTER</p>
  <p>The community-built port of OpenOffice.org for Mac OS
    X (X11) is now officially Golden Master (GM). </p>
  <p>June 2003 - The Openoffice.org community (www.openoffice.org)
    today announced the Mac OS X port of OpenOffice.org 1.0.3 for X11. The release
    is ready for immediate download by all Mac OS X users from OpenOffice.org
    (<a href="//">www.openoffice.org</a>).</p>
  <p>The code for this port has been in development by the
    community since April 2001, when the code base was released to the open-source
    community by Sun Microsystems, Inc. This release uses the X Windows System,
    common to Unix and Unix-like machines; X Windows from the open-source project
    XFree86.org (<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">www.xfree86.org</a>) is included
    in the installation set. Users may also download the free beta X11 for Mac
    OS from Apple (<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/x11/">www.apple.com/macosx/x11/</a>).
    OpenOffice.org for Mac OS X (X11) takes advantage of the popularity of X11
    in the open-source world and incorporates FreeType's font engine, producing
    clean, smooth, anti-aliased fonts (see <a href="http://www.freetype.org/">www.freetype.org</a>).
    The result is a sophisticated integration with the Mac OS X, making this
    release suitable for
    all.</p>
  <p>Dan Williams, who along with Ed Peterlin is a key developer
    of the build, points out that, &quot;Anti-aliasing is more than an aesthetic
    convenience. It makes presentations and all other documents look highly professional.
    This is one feature that now makes OpenOffice.org look exceptional on Mac
    OS X.&quot;</p>
  <p>OpenOffice.org can open and save as Microsoft Office
    documents, allowing for heterogeneous office environments (Windows, Linux,
    Mac OS X), and runs stably and natively&nbsp; on multiple platforms, including
    Linux, PPC Linux, Solaris, Windows and other flavors of Unix. The Mac OS
    X developer release uses a ZeroG installer (<a href="http://www.zerog.com/">www.ZeroG.com</a>. The OpenOffice.org
    community wishes&nbsp; to thank ZeroG in this key contribution to delivering
    this port).</p>
  <p>&quot;This release is a triumph not only for Ed Peterlin,
    Dan Williams, and other contributors with the Mac OS X porting team, but
    for the collaboration between the open-source community and enterprises such
    as Sun and Apple,&quot; said OpenOffice.org Community Manager Louis Suarez-Potts. &quot;OpenOffice.org
    1.0 is the best open-source office suite there is. It does everything you
    need and frees you from lock-in and licensing fees. With this release, all
    Mac OS X users can now enjoy the freedom of OpenOffice.org 1.0.&quot;</p>
  <p>Developers interested in contributing to OpenOffice.org
    can find the tools and resources on the OpenOffice.org Mac site (http://mac.openoffice.org/).
    Work is continuing both to track future releases of OpenOffice, as well as
    to integrate better with Apple's native Aqua environment.</p>

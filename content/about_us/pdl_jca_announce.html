<h2>The New License and New Joint Copyright Assignment</h2>
<p>
There are some important announcements, and they are good. We have:
    <ul>
	<li><a href="#pdl">A new documentation license</a></li>
	<li><a href="#jca">A new copyright assignment</a></li>
</ul>

<h4> A New Documentation License <a name="pdl"></a></h4>

<p>
As you know, OpenOffice.org has historically used a dual license strategy for source code: the LGPL and SISSL.  Both of these licenses allow for Open Source work to be done.  They also allow for commercialization. However, neither is particularly good for documents that are meant to be modified by other people and used on the website or in publications.
</p>

<p>
So, over the last few months we (a group including Sun and OpenOffice.org volunteers) have worked together to craft a new license, the Public Document License, for meeting these needs.  This new license permits the free modification of documents covered by it, thereby encouraging collaboration on documents posted to the OpenOffice.org website.
</p>

<h4>A New Copyright Assignment <a name="jca"></a></h4>

<p> Since its beginning, OpenOffice.org has required committers to CVS (including 
  website content) to sign over their copyright to Sun to ensure there is a single 
  entity holding copyright. The code is of course governed by the Open Source 
  licenses. But the Copyright Assignment, as it is known, does not accommodate 
  contributors who wish to retain copyright over their contributions. </p>

<p> Thus, the new Joint Copyright Assignment. Under the JCA, developers may now 
  also keep all rights to any code and related material they commit to the source. 
  Everyone benefits from this strategy: developers may do as they please with 
  their code and at the same time a single, coherent entity jointly holds the 
  copyright for the OpenOffice.org source. This is important for instance in the 
  case of legal defense. </p>

<p>
The new copyright structure also makes it easier for people to contribute to the website.  People no longer need to fill out a copyright assignment to submit material to the website; the PDL is adequate for this purpose.

April 30, 2002 - The OpenOffice.org community (<A HREF="//">www.openoffice.org</A>)

 today announced the availability of OpenOffice.org 1.0, the open

source, multi-platform, multi-lingual office productivity suite

available as a free download at the OpenOffice.org community website.

 OpenOffice.org 1.0 is the culmination of more than 18 months of

collaborative effort by members of the OpenOffice.org community,

which is comprised of Sun employees, volunteer developers, marketers,

and end users working to create an international office suite that

will run on all major platforms.</P>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">

<BR>

</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">OpenOffice.org 1.0,

which shares the same code base as Sun's StarOffice [tm] 6.0 software

is &ndash; like StarOffice 6.0 software &ndash; a full-featured

office suite that provides a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft

Office.  OpenOffice.org 1.0 offers software freedom, enabling a free

market for service and support, while the Sun-branded product,

StarOffice 6.0 software, offers 24x7 fee-based support and training

for consumers and businesses, along with deployment and migration

services.  StarOffice software also offers additional features, such

as a database, special fonts and Sun quality and assurance testing. 

The two office suites complement each other, meeting the varying

needs of  consumers, open source advocates and enterprise customers. 

</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%"><BR><BR>

</P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">

&quot;OpenOffice.org 1.0 may be the single best hope for consumers

fed-up with Microsoft's desktop monopoly,&quot; said Eric Raymond,

co-founder of the Open Source Initiative (OSI). &quot;With Sun moving

to a full service and support business model for StarOffice software,

users around the globe will continue to have a free office

productivity software tool through the OpenOffice.org open source

community.&quot;</P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">

<BR><BR>

</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">The OpenOffice.org

1.0 office suite features key desktop applications &ndash; including

word processor, spreadsheet, presentation  and drawing programs &ndash;

in more than 25 languages. In addition, OpenOffice.org 1.0 works

transparently with a variety of file formats, enabling users familiar

with other office suites, such as Microsoft Office and StarOffice

software, to work seamlessly in the application. The OpenOffice.org

1.0 software runs stably and natively on multiple platforms,

including Linux, PPC Linux, Solaris [tm], Windows and many other

flavors of Unix.</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%"><BR><BR>

</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">OpenOffice.org is

the largest open source project with more than 7.5 million lines of

code.  To date, more than 4.5 million downloads of earlier versions

of OpenOffice.org 1.0 have taken place. With the release of the 1.0

version, the OpenOffice.org community expects that number to grow

significantly as businesses and individuals around the world explore

the free alternative to proprietary office suites.  

</P>

<P STYLE="line-height: 150%"><B>The OpenOffice.org Community</B></P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">In less than two

years, the OpenOffice.org community has grown to more than 10,000

volunteers, working together to build the leading international

office suite that will run on all major platforms and provide access

to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and

an XML-based file format. Sun initiated this effort by donating the

StarOffice software source code and engineering to the OpenOffice.org

community. One of the major benefits of community-based development

is peer review, which has resulted in a stable, secure and flexible

software package.</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%"><BR><BR>

</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">Participants in the

Community work on projects ranging from code development to porting

and localization, to bug reporting, documentation,  product

marketing,  local language sites and mirror sites for software

download.</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">&quot;There are

many important roles that volunteer developers can play to shape the

future functionality of OpenOffice.org (OOo) so if you are looking

for someplace to contribute, OOo can use you,&quot; said Kevin

Hendricks, a key contributor to the OpenOffice.org community since

its inception nearly two years ago. Hendricks has lead volunteer

development teams for both the OpenOffice.org 1.0 spellchecker and

PPC Linux port projects.

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; line-height: 150%">

&quot;When OpenOffice.org was released, it was a tremendous amount of

code with a very deep history, and thus we knew it would take a lot

of time and effort to reach a critical mass of community

participation,&quot; said Brian Behlendorf, CTO and co-founder,

CollabNet.&nbsp; &quot;The project has now attracted a significant

amount of outside involvement, some of it in pretty interesting areas

like marketing and quality assurance.&nbsp; With the release of 1.0,

it's clear those efforts are bearing real fruit.&nbsp;

Congratulations to the community -- and to Sun -- for making this

happen.&quot;</P>

&quot;OpenOffice.org may be the most important open source project

right now,&rdquo; said Miguel de Icaza, founder of the GNOME

project.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because people will try it and see they can get

everyday work done without giving more money to Microsoft, they'll

see -- in a low-risk way -- that open source software can work for

them and be an even better solution.&rdquo;</P>

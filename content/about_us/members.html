<h2>OpenOffice.org Member Responsibilities: Mail Lists</h2>
<p><i>Last updated 2002 January 31</i></p>
<br>

<h4>OpenOffice.org Member Responsibilities: Mail Lists</h4>
<p>Please familiarize yourself with the following simple member responsibilities.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Members are encouraged to participate in any mailing list as long as they 
    honor Open Source principles of respect to other members and to the project 
    at hand. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Repeated violation of these principles will result in suspension of the 
    member's membership in the relevant mailing list. If the member insists on 
    joining under different aliases, the member's posts will be quarantined. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Spam is not tolerated. For the most part, OpenOffice.org avoids spam by 
    restricting posts to subscribers. In the rare case where a spammer subscribes 
    to a list and posts spam to the list, he or she will be deleted from the list. 
    Continued violation will result in the spammer being reported to his or her 
    ISP (Internet Serviced Provider).</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>Please do not send attachments with your message, as they add to the bandwidth 
    burden we must all deal with. OpenOffice.org features several other avenues 
    for persons interested in submitting attachments. Check with your project 
    lead or send a message to <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org</a> 
    to find out which would be best for you.</li>
</ol>

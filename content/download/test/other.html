  + "<p>If you want to use more than a single language in Apache OpenOffice then it is recommended to use "
  + "<a href='http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Languagepack' title='What is a language pack?'>language packs</a>. The idea "
  + "is to have a base language, e.g., English (US) and several other languages without a need to install for every "
  + "language a full installation. Due to this it has to be installed over a full installation with the same version "
  + "number and platform. The language can be changed via the menu \"Tools - Options - Language Settings - Languages - "
  + "User Interface\".</p>"

  + "<p>They are not integrated in the full installation file and it contains only resource files to show, e.g., menus, "
  + "dialogs, error messages in your favorite language - but there is no program logic. It may contain translated Help "
  + "content as well. Language packs are created only when also a full installation file is available. In case it is not "
  + "fully localized, some elements of the UI or help topics will display in English as default language.</p>"

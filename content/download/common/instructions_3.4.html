<p><em>Please note: With this new 3.4 release, a JRE (Jave Runtime Environment) is no longer packaged with OpenOffice.
However, you may still need a JRE for full functionality of AOO 3.4. (See <a href="java.html">
Java and Apache OpenOffice</a>). Please ensure that your system has at least Java 1.6 installed for full
functionality.</em></p>

<h3 id="comprehensive">Comprehensive Installation Instructions</h3>

<p>This section describes in detail how to install Apache OpenOffice on your computer system.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll want to do is read through these instructions completely, and use the
<a href="https://www.openoffice.org/support/">Apache OpenOffice</a> site to answer any questions you might have. The site
contains documentation for users of all levels, beginner to advanced; a good place to get started for all new users of
Apache OpenOffice would be browsing the FAQ.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
Log in as an administrator if your computer only allows people with administrator privileges to install programmes.</p>

<h3>Review the System Requirements</h3>

<p>Your computer needs these resources as a minimum to run Apache OpenOffice 3.4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 2000 (Service Pack 2 or higher), Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista</li>
  <li>256 Mbytes RAM (512 MB RAM recommended)</li>
  <li>At least 650 Mbytes available disk space for a default install (including a JRE) via download. After installation and
  deletion of temporary installation files, Apache OpenOffice will use approximately 440 Mbytes disk space.</li>
  <li>1024 x 768 or higher resolution with at least 256 colours</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="download">Download Apache OpenOffice 3.4</h3>

<p>To download Apache OpenOffice from our website, you do not need to login. Also, it does not cost anything other than what
your costs are to connect to the internet and download a large file.</p>

<p>If your connection is not very fast (and or you are behind a dial up connection), you might consider a program that
enables you to pause/resume the download. We've listed some popular
<a href="downloadtools.html">download managers here</a>.</p>

<p>To download the most current version of Apache OpenOffice:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Display <a href="/">www.openoffice.org</a>, and click on the large green Download button displayed in the middle of
  the web page. This will display the downloads page.</p></li>
  <li>Do you see a blue box? Inside the blue box, the first drop down menu is prompting you to select your language. Click
  on the down arrow to the right of this drop down menu and select your language from the list.
  <p>For those languages where more than one mirror site is available you will be prompted to choose the operating system
  (platform). "Windows" is at the top of the list.</p>
  <p>Choose a mirror (download location) closest to you.</p></li>
  <li>An interim page will be displayed with some information on how to contribute to the project and how to locate other
  resources, and seek support.
  <p>Click the "Continue to Download" button to proceed to download Apache OpenOffice to your computer. You will be prompted
  by a dialog window as to where you want to place the download file on your computer. Note this down, as you will need to
  find it later to install Apache OpenOffice on your computer.</p>
  <p>Note: You may also want to copy the downloaded file to a backup medium (CD-ROM, ZIP disk, etc.).</p></li>
  <li>To check the integrity of the file that you have downloaded, please go to the information page for 
  <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums/3.4.1_checksums.html">AOO 3.4.0 checksums</a> or
  <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/checksums/3.4.1_checksums.html">AOO 3.4.1 checksums</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Unpack and install the downloaded Apache OpenOffice 3.4 files</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Either using Windows Explorer or Mozilla/Netscape's Download Manager, navigate to the Apache OpenOffice file you
  downloaded.
  <p>Windows Explorer users will want to find the file and double-click to launch the unpacking and installation program.
  Alternately, Mozilla/Netscape users will want to open the Download Manager, highlight the file, and click Launch File.
  In either case, the unpacking program will start.</p>
  <p>The Welcome window is displayed to note that you have downloaded Apache OpenOffice 3.4. Click Next to continue.</p></li>
  <li>The Select Folder window is displayed. Accept the folder name displayed in the text box or enter the name of the
  folder in which to save the unpacked files, and click Unpack.

  <!--
  <b>Note:</b> Remember the directory that the Apache OpenOffice file is unpacked to as you will need to locate this later
  to run the <i>setup.exe</i> installation programme.
  -->

  </li>
  <li>Once the files are unpacked, the Apache OpenOffice 3.4 Installation Wizard is displayed. Click Next to continue
  installing Apache OpenOffice 3.4. Follow the prompts, and Apache OpenOffice will be installed on your system, ready for
  use.</li>
  <li>Read the information in the Welcome window and then click Next.
  <p>The License Agreement window appears.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b>
  You will need to use the scroll bar to view all of the license text If you do not wish to accept the license, you will be
  prompted to confirm this before the installation programme closes.</p></li>
  <li>Read the license, select "I accept the terms in the license agreement", and click Next.
  <p>The Customer Information window appears.</p>
  <p>You may leave this form blank, or enter your User Name and if applicable, Organisation.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b>
  If you logged in as administrator you will be prompted to install for all users.</p></li>
  <li>Complete Customer Information form and click Next.
  <p>The Setup Type window appears.</p></li>
  <li>Select a setup type (we recommend Complete) and click Next.
  <p id="fileassoc">The File Type window is displayed.</p></li>
  <li>Select the file types that you wish to open with the Apache OpenOffice program.
  <p>The default configuration is that all the file types are selected. This means that the Apache OpenOffice programme will
  start when these file types are opened. De-select (click on the ticks) to view, edit and print these file types with your
  existing word processing, spreadsheet or presentation program.</p>
  <p>Note: If you change your mind, returning to the prior state is tedious. You will need to reassociate all word
  processing, spreadsheet or presentation files with the appropriate file type.

  <!--
  To read more, please see the
  <a href="http://user-faq.openoffice.org/faq/ar01s04.html#FILE-ASSOCIATIONS">file associations FAQ</a>
  on the Apache OpenOffice web site.
  -->

  </p>
  <p>You can use file types not associated with Apache OpenOffice, by starting Apache OpenOffice then open the file by
  choosing Open from the File menu.</p></li>
  <li>Once you have selected the file types click Next.
  <p>The Ready to Install the Program window is displayed.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click the Back button to return to previous windows to change your installation options, otherwise click Install to
  begin the installation process.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click the Finish button when the Installation Wizard Finished window is displayed.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you logged in as administrator, logout. Each user can then invoke Apache OpenOffice from the program menu which
  will allow the user to configure Apache OpenOffice as a workstation copy with no further effort on the part of the
  user.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Run Apache OpenOffice to ensure that the installation was successful</h3>

<p>When you first run Apache OpenOffice after a successfully installing the program, you will be prompted to accept the
license, enter your user name and register your copy.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Login using your user account, and if you installed Apache OpenOffice successfully it will appear on the Programs
  sub-menu of the Start menu.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click on one of the Apache OpenOffice components (we recommend Writer). The Welcome window is displayed.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click Next to display the License Agreement window.</p></li>
  <li><p>Scroll to read the license and click Accept to continue. The Transfer personal data window is displayed.</p>
  <p>If you wish to reuse personal data from a previous installation click [Next].</p>
  <p>If you do not wish to reuse any settings from a previous installed version, unmark the checkbox and click
  [Next].</p></li>
  <li>The user information window is displayed.
  <p>You are prompted to enter your name. This is used in the document properties, templates and when you record changes
  made to documents. This is useful if you are working on a document with others, but you don't need to complete this
  information in order to proceed. This information can also be entered later when using the program.</p></li>
  <li>Complete the form and click Next to display the Registration window.
  <p>You will need to be connected to the internet if you select "I want to register now" and click Finish. Your browser
  will display a welcome message on the Apache OpenOffice web site and then redirect you to a user survey page.</p>
  <p>If you are not connected to the internet, you can choose to register later.</p>
  <p>Registration of Apache OpenOffice and completion of the user survey is optional and is not required for you to ensure
  full use of Apache OpenOffice.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b>
  Registration of the Apache OpenOffice programme is completely separate to subscribing to various Apache OpenOffice mailing
  lists and registering yourself with the "www.openoffice.org" site to submit bugs, enhancement requests and contribute to
  projects.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You have successfully installed and run Apache OpenOffice. You should now refer to the online help (Choose "Apache
OpenOffice Help" from the Help menu) or connect to the internet to obtain support from the
<a href="https://www.openoffice.org" title="Apache OpenOffice Homepage"></a> web site by clicking the Support tab available
from any web page.</p>

<p>Thank you for using Apache OpenOffice, and welcome!</p>

<h2 id="linux-rpm">Linux RPM-based Installation</h2>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>If you want Java integration, you want to make sure you have the latest JRE installed. It should be at least JRE 1.6.
You can find the JRE for Linux at the <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/linux_manual.jsp"> Java JRE for Linux</a>
download site. Or, you can choose to have the JRE included with your Apache OpenOffice download. Alternatively, a JRE might
be included on the installation media of your distro as part of a complete Java development environment.</p>

<h3>Installation Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Review the <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/sys_reqs_aoo34.html">System Requirements</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/">Download your favorite Linux version of Apache OpenOffice</a></li>
  <li>Unpack the downloaded image to prepare for installation.<br />
  The following command should work: <code>tar -xvzf "linux package name".tar.gz</code><br />
  where "linux package name" is the beginning part of the archive you just downloaded.<br /><br />
  This will create an installation directory.<br />
  The name of the installation directory will likely be the langueage abbreviation for the install set, e.g., en-US.</li>
  <li><code>su</code> to root, if necessary, and navigate to Apache OpenOffice installation directory (the unpacked
  archive).<br />
  <em>You will likely need to be root to run the rpm command to install the software.</em></li>
  <li><code>cd</code> into the RPMS subdirectory of the installation directory.<br />
  You should see a lot of rpms here and one sub-directory called "desktop-integration".</li>
  <li>Install this new version by typing <code>rpm -Uvih *rpm</code>.<br />
  By default, this will install OpenOffice in your <code>/opt</code> directory.<br />
  <b>NOTE:</b>
  See additional installation options and other useful information in the
  <a href="https://documentation.openoffice.org/setup_guide2/index.html#12">Setup Guide</a>.</li>
  <li>Install the desktop integration features for your setup.<br />
  <code>cd</code> to <code>desktop-integration</code> in the installation directory,<br />
  and, depending on your package manager/system, install the appropriate desktop interface using RPM.</li>
  <li>Finally, start up Apache OpenOffice 3.4 to insure it's working.</li>
</ol>

  and, depending on your package manager/system, install the appropriate desktop interface using dpkg.</li>
  <li>Finally, start up Apache OpenOffice 3.4 to insure it's working.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="other_linux">Packages for Linux Distributions (Not compiled by Apache OpenOffice developers)</h3>

<p>Many Linux distributions now include a version of Apache OpenOffice in their own native package manager format (.rpm,
.deb, etc.). These packages have been built and are supported by the distributions' own teams, not by Apache OpenOffice.
Some distributions have strict policies around licensing, which means they have chosen to disable parts of Apache OpenOffice
which rely on software which does not meet their criteria (e.g. the Fedora rpms have disabled the parts of Apache OpenOffice
which require Java).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
Please check carefully before using a third-party build that it does actually include all the parts of Apache OpenOffice that
you will require. Replacing a 'native' distribution build with the full Apache OpenOffice original build can be tricky, but
can usually be successfully accomplished by completely removing the existing 'native' install.</p>

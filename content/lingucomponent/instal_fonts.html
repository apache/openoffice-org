          Uninstalled Fonts won't Check</a></h2>
          <pre>
    &gt; from [users]  2002-Nov-25
    &gt; It turns out the problem was that OOo was defaulting to use the
    &gt; "Thorndale" font that is not installed on my Linux box.
    &gt; If OOo spell-checks an unknown font it considers it a symbol font. It
    &gt; never spellchecks symbol fonts so none of my text was flagged as misspelled.
          </pre>

          <p>In Issue #7336: http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=7336 which was resolved 2002-Oct-08; <br />
          here is a condensed version:</p>

          <p>Spell checking does work. Please check the following:</p>

          <p>1. The font the text is written in must actually exist on the system for spell checking to work reliably.<br />
          <b><em>Thorndale and Albany do not exist on any system without StarOffice 6.0</em></b>.<br />
          So, please, highlight the text in your document and try changing it to some font that really does exist on your machine.</p>

          <p>2. Every document has a "language" associated with it (in fact every single character does in OOo). Please <br />
          highlight some mispelled text, then go to <b>Format-&gt;Character</b>, choose the <b>Font</b> tab, and look at the <br />
          <b>Language</b> pulldown. Change it to English (USA) and you should see a little checkmark [and Abc] beside it.<br />
          <br />
          [<b>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;TextDocument-&gt;BasicFontsWestern</b>: change to fonts that <b>are</b> installed on your system.]</p>

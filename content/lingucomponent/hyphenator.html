<h2>Lingucomponent Sub-Project: Hyphenation</h2>

<p>One of the goals of this projects is to improve the quality of the
hyphenator and include more hyphenation dictionaries from various languages.</p>

<p>The OpenOffice.org hyphenator was based on the libhnj library by Raph Levien. It
uses TeX hyphenation dictionaries with small corrections.
There are many <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries"> currently supported languages</a>.</p>

<p> It is reasonably easy to port the TeX hyphenation dictionary (usually located
in <strong>tex/generic/hyphen/</strong> directory of TeX tree) to OpenOffice.org's
hyphenation format. To help with hyphenation dictionary
creation there is a <strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=143754&amp;package_id=231949">standalone version of the 
hyphenation code</a></strong> available with a simple example program 
that can be used for development and testing.  Some hints follow:</p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
	<li>You need to replace or remove all TeX macroses from library.</li>
	<li>You need to call <tt>substrings.pl</tt> (can be found in the standalone hyphenator
		linked above).<br />
		Usage: <tt>substrings.pl &lt;patterns.dic&gt; &lt;newpatterns.dic&gt;</tt><br />
		This will write the modified file to <tt>newpatterns.dic</tt>.</li>
	<li>You need to put an indicator of the character encoding used
as the first line of the dictionary file (look in <tt>hyph_en.dic</tt>).
Possible values are: ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, ..., ISO8859-10, KOI8-R 	</li>
	<li>See <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Extensions_development">Extensions development</a>
		on how to deploy your hyphenation dictionary in OpenOffice.org.</li>
</ul>

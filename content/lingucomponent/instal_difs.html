          Dictionary Installation Differences between OOo100 and OOo101</a></h2>

          <p>In OOo100 and before, there were only <em>user</em> dictionaries, therefore, each user would have <br />
          to install the dictionaries of their choice in the directory:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\Program Files\OOo100\user\wordbook\&nbsp;&nbsp; or
          &nbsp;&nbsp;/home/jrandom/OOo100/user/wordbook/</p>

          <p><b>Network installation by SysAdmin: Linux and Windows</b><br />
          By popular demand, in OOo101 (the latest stable release), there is now a shared dictionary location:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;network installation directory&gt;/OpenOffice.org1.0.1/share/dict/ooo/<br />
          so that System Administrators, or root types, can install dictionaries there, that will be available for users to activate <br />
          as needed. The process of registering the dictionaries by the SysAdmin is the same, add the appropriate lines to the<br />
          &lt;net path&gt;/OOo101/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst &nbsp;&nbsp;in the -net install location. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(see Activation)</p>

          <p><b>Standalone installation by Windows user:</b><br />
          The installation for users on standalone boxes remains the same:<br />
          Unzip the dictionary of your choice into the directory: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c:\Program Files\OOo101\user\wordbook\<br />
          then, edit / create the dictionary.lst file in this directory, by adding a line corresponding to the dictionary <br />
          you installed, e.g., DICT it IT it_IT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(see Activation)</p>

          <p><b>Standalone installation by Linux user:</b><br />
          Since Linux is a multi-user OS, the network install is required for proper functioning.<br />
          Unzip the dictionary of your choice into the directory:<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /home/jrandom/OOo10x/user/wordbook/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;network installation directory&gt;/OpenOffice.org1.0.1/share/dict/ooo/<br />
          then, edit/create the dictionary.lst file in this directory, by adding a line corresponding to the dictionary <br />
          you installed, e.g., DICT es ES es_ES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(see Activation)</p>

          <p><b>ACTIVATION of additional dictionaries by all users:</b><br />
          Each user now needs to restart OOo (and quickstarter) to force OOo to reparse the lines in dictionary.lst,<br />
          then go to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;LanguageSettings-&gt;WritingAids</b> and press the <b>"Edit"</b> button.<br />
          There, each user, using the pulldown can select their language(s) and enable MySpell spellchecking<br />
          by putting a mark in the checkbox. Then, in Language, select the one in which you wish to write and spell check.</p>

<h4>Preface</h4>
<p>This style guide has grown from it initial short version to something much 
	longer. However, thanks to the wonders of hypertext, one need not read all of 
	it; just the relevant sections. The three most important sections are featured 
	in the &quot;<a href="#quickstart">Quick Start</a>&quot; and include: <a href="#projectindex">The 
	Project Index Page</a>, <a href="#linking">Linking</a>, and <a href="#styles">style 
	sheets</a> (CSS). Other sections describe the OpenOffice.org <a href="#website">website</a>, 
	our <a href="#ooostyle">style</a>, how to do OpenOffice.org <a href="#tables">tables</a>, 
	and so on.</p>
<p>This guide is meant to be viewed by a Web browser, or by a WYSIWYG HTML editor. 
	If you do look at it through an editor such as HomeSite or BBEdit, things will 
	look strange, as I wrote it presuming people would see it from a browser's perspective. 
	I have tried to include as many &quot;cut-and-paste examples&quot; as I could 
	think of; these are clearly labeled as such below. You can also just copy from 
	the existing website.</p>
<p>If you have questions, please send them to me: <a href="mailto:louis@collab.net">louis@collab.net</a>.

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<h4><b><u>What to do</u></b> </h4>
<blockquote> 
	<p>Use our index page <a href="index_template.html" target="_blank">template</a>. 
		Or, use StarOffice or OpenOffice.org to create your index page. Either way, 
		follow these conventions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Headings: No <b>h1.</b> Use <b>h2</b> for the largest heading, with h3 
			and h4 for subheadings. If you use h1, nothing bad will happen, it will 
			just look odd. </li>
		<li>Leave fonts as default. Exceptions: code font. </li>
		<li>No document title. It won't appear, or it may appear in an ugly fashion 
			at the top of the page</li>
		<li>Use <a href="#linking">relative links</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>That is about it. There is no need for h1 heading, as it is rather too large. 
		If you use StarOffice/OpenOffice.org, you can conform your page to OpenOffice.org 
		standards using <a href="#tidy">Tidy.</a> Tidy will configure the page so 
		that it does not disrupt the operation of SourceCast. For more information 
		about the OpenOffice.org website, please read below, &quot;<a href="#about">About 
		the OpenOffice.org Website</a>.&quot; </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4><a name="overview">Overview: HTML</a></h4>
<p>I won't bore you with a definition of HTML, but basically an HTML page or document 
	is comprised of plain, unformatted text with embedded commands in the text adjacent 
	to the target text that stipulate the way the target text should look when viewed 
	according to certain conventions by certain technologies. These commands are 
	called "tags,&quot; come in paired sets, and look like regular text: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;</font>, 
	for instance, gives you <b>bold</b>. Not terribly complicated, the idea is simplicity 
	itself. A browser constructed and instructed to view these tags according to 
	the accepted standards and conventions will thus read the tag for bold as indicating 
	that the characters within the brackets should be represented in boldface. More 
	involved tags do the same logical thing only more elaborately.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: When coding in HTML you have to tell the browser when to start 
	reading something and when to end reading it: The opening and closing tags. 
	These tag pairs may be separated by any number of characters, but must be nested. 
	Thus: ABC...CBA.</p>
<p>Almost all modern word processing software such as StarOffice are able to convert 
	formatted text into HTML pages that <i>look</i> the same (or close enough), 
	when viewed by a suitable browser (less suitable: older browsers that are not 
	equipped to read the latest HTML conventions). As well, really rudimentary word 
	processors and text editors can be used. In fact the HTML hackers among us <i>prefer 
	</i>dumb programs that don't add any extra formatting, because they rightly 
	want to be in control of what it is they are creating, and have no nasty surprises 
	in store. A bugbear of HTML coders is that different browsers read code differently, 
	which makes sense, if you think of a browser as a mechanical renderer of text 
	that proceeds according to certain conventions.</p>
<p>(If you are interested in learning more about HTML construction, a good place 
	to start is <a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">http://www.W3C.org</a>)</p>
<p>In short, you can create your Web (HTML) pages using StarOffice (or OpenOffice.org) 
	or some other text processor...but there are some caveats. I'll deal with them 
	in the next section.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>
<h4>About the OpenOffice.org Website<a name="about"></a></h4>
<p>We have a fairly simple architecture in which there is static element framing 
	a dynamic element. The static element comprises the header, footer, title, and 
	navbars. The dynamic only consists of the content in the middle: the body of 
	the text. Using the latest technology, these static and dynamic elements are 
	composited together, producing a coherent Web page. </p>
<p>Because of this arrangement, you cannot (or at least should not) create pages 
	that <i>also</i> have those parts the static section supplies. That is, any 
	page created for the OpenOffice.org website should start with whatever you have 
	to say--the content--and that's it. No&lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;. &lt;body&gt; 
	tags. Only your content.</p>
<p>And if you do include such tags, what will happen? Probably nothing exciting. 
	Browsers read from left to right, top to bottom, so it will read the static 
	tags first (which is why all our pages are dumbly remembered in the browser 
	as &quot;www.openoffice.org&quot; no matter what their content), and will very 
	likely simply ignore your redundant tag. At most the text between the title 
	tags will appear at the top of your page in black default font.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. If you write a &quot;meta&quot; tag and are stipulating 
	XHTML or something else that deviates from the kind of HTML declared in the 
	static tag, the browser will likely understand your stipulation and proceed 
	accordingly. And, you can certainly use page-local cascading style sheets (CSS). 
	(StarOffice, like Microsoft Office, saves formatted documents using styles.) 
	However, unless the styles are clearly defined in the document or in a page 
	loaded with the document, they may not be read appropriately, as they may conflict 
	with OpenOffice.org's own styles. (See below, <a href="#styles"> Style Sheets</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: For various reasons, please only use <i>lower case</i> not UPPER 
	CASE HTML formatting. Thus: &lt;bold&gt; not &lt;BOLD&gt;. If you use upper
	case, nothing bad will happen. However, XHTML (which is a more flexible form 
	of HTML) does see case differences, so our preference now is for lower case 
	tags. </p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>

<h4>The OpenOffice.org Style<a name="ooostyle"></a></h4>
<p>As already mentioned, our pages are simple, with very few jpgs, gifs, or any 
	other graphics, and no animation of any sort. We use a simple three-color scheme 
	of blues and lots of white spaces. This makes the pages easy to read. We also 
	use a kind of reddish-brown for h2 headings. All these attributes are determined 
	by our style sheet. See the above &quot;<a href="#styles">Styles</a>&quot; and 
	&quot;<a href="#sample">Sample</a>&quot; for further insight.</p>
<p><i>For general pages</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>Background: Do not specify a color. Our style sheet in the static element 
		does that for you. You can specify a background color for a <i>table</i>; 
		see below.</li>
	<li>Text: Black and default font</li>
	<li>Page Heading: 
		<ul>
			<li> Format: Heading 2 (h3) for big headers (page names, say), heading 3 
				(h3) for smaller subheadings; heading 4 (h4) for below that 
			<li>Face: Default</li>
			<li>For example, the heading to this page looks like this in HTML: &lt;h2&gt;&lt; 
				&gt; Style Guide&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For smaller headings (section headings, for instance) use the same face
		color/style, but diminish the size appropriately. (See below, example 1.)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>
<p><a name="tidy"></a> 
<h4>Using Tidy</h4>
<p>Get and configure HTML <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/" target="_blank">Tidy</a> 
	for your editing environment. This terrific utility cleans up broken HTML instead 
	of merely complaining about it. As Todd Fahner, who is generally deemed one 
	of the leading experts in HTML composition writes, &quot;I strongly recommend 
	using it to achieve the initial xhtmlification of the files. Unfortunately, 
	markup-oriented tools turn Velocity (formerly WebMacro) logic into hamburger, 
	so you can't run the tool on the source. But you can run it on the output and 
	then manually merge it back into the source. It's better than re-keying it all. 
	Use <a href="./tidyconfig.html">this</a> config file for Tidy.</p>
<p> I recommend you use Tidy if you have created your Web page using a text-processor 
	such as StarOffice or OpenOffice.org, or, if you have used a WYSIWYG HTML editor 
	such as Dreamweaver or Go Live, both of which impart their own characteristics. 
	(A good WYSIWYG editor that is quite clean is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/" target="_blank">Amaya,</a> 
	which is preferred by the W3C. Amaya runs on Windows.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>

<h4><a name="styles"></a>Style Sheets</h4>
<p> OpenOffice.org now uses style sheets. This is good, as style sheets allow 
	us to place all the formatting information on one sheet which a browser then 
	refers to. As a result, both page size and access time are reduced, dramatically 
	so. But there are some consequences. If a user has turned off the style sheet
	option in their browser, they will not see the page as it has been designed. 
	They will see something considerably drabber, but still perfectly functional.</p>
<p><b>Consequences.</b> Our style sheet determines the font and font-face: of 
	the Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif family; h1 is black, h2 is #cc3300 (a reddish 
	brown), h3, h4, black. If you stipulate your own fonts and font-faces, your 
	page may not display properly, as the browser will essentially pick and choose 
	syntagmatically from the options presented it. Your page may look a mess, in 
	short.</p>
<p>Therefore: do not stipulate any font or font-face. Leave it blank. If you have 
	created a page that's a conversion from a StarOffice or OpenOffice.org document, 
	see if you can use Tidy to clean it up. If you cannot, see if you can strip 
	the font and font-face information by hand, so that only the font heading information 
	(h1, h2, h3, etc.) remains. And if that fails, don't worry, probably nothing 
	<i>bad</i> will happen, your page will just look a little odd. </p>
<p><b>Note. </b>If you would like additions to the style sheet, please let me 
	know by sending mail to <a href="mailto:louis@collab.net">louis@collab.net</a>.

	<br>
	<br>
	<a name="linking"></a> 
<h4>Linking, Or, How to Write Links That <i><b>Work</b></i></h4>
<p><u><b>Absolute vs. Relative Links</b></u></p>
<p><i><b>We now use relative links.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Please use relative links of the form described below: 
<ul>
	<li>For top-level, &quot;index.html&quot; pages, use : &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/[directoryname]/[doc.html]</font>&quot; 
		when referring to documents in the directory <i>below the one in which the 
		index.html</i> <i>is located.</i> That is, if you have an index.html page 
		that refers to, say, &quot;specialstyles.html&quot; in the directory &quot;special,&quot;
		you would use &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/special/specialstyles.html</font>&quot;. 
		Failure to use this convention will routinely result in broken links. </li>
	<li>In contrast, when referring to documents <i>within a directory</i>, please 
		use: &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">[doc.html],</font>&quot; 
		without a preceding slash. If you precede the filename with a slash, you will 
		take the browser to top-level directory. 
		<ul>
			<li>Thus, if you are writing a link from within the index.html page of the 
				<font face=Courier New, Courier, mono"> "main"</font> directory referring 
				to a document in a subdirectory, it would be <font face=Courier New, Courier, mono"> 
				/foo/foobar.html</font>. And if you aer writing a link from the "<font face="courier, new, courier, mono">paper.html</font>" 
				page within the <font face=Courier New, Courier, mono"> /main/</font> 
				directory to the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/foo/foobar.html</font> 
				page, you would write as: &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;a 
				href=&quot;foo/foobar.html&quot;&gt;</font>&quot;, without the preceding 
				slash. This is because if you include it, it tells the browser to go to 
				the root directory, which unless you are writing from the root, is not what you 
				want.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Do not precede the filename with a period, as in &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">./[doc].html</font>&quot;. 
		Doing so will result in unpredictable behavior (of SourceCast). </li>
	<li>When referring to links <i>above</i> the directory in which you are working, 
		use the standard convention of &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">../</font>&quot; 
		per directory rung. Thus, if you are in <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/foo/</font> 
		and you want to refer to &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">whee.html</font> 
		in /main/ you would write: &quot;<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;a 
		href=&quot;../whee.html&quot;&gt;</font>&quot; ; and so on, with <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">../</font> 
		denoting a move up to the root index of that directory.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Longer explanation</b>. The tendency in OpenOffice.org has been to use absolute 
	links. That is, links of the form, "<font face="courier, courier new">http://www.openoffice.org/styles/index_template.html</font>" 
	referring to a file in the same directory as this document, rather than "<font face="courier, courier new">/styles/index_template.html</font>" 
	(written in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">www/index.html</font> 
	page). Both addresses refer to the same document--the index template; the former 
	is, however, is called "absolute" because the path won't change to reflect any 
	movement of the directory in which the documents live. In contrast, a "relative" 
	link, "<font face="courier, courier new">/index_template.html</font>" allows 
	for greater flexibility. All documents in the <font face="courier, courier new">/styles/</font> 
	directory can be moved along with the directory, and HTTP addresses will work, 
	no matter where they are subsequently placed. </p>
<p>Thus, if I were to relocate "<font face="courier, courier new">http://www.openoffice.org/styles/index_template.html</font>" 
	to, say, the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">/betterstyles/</font> directory, 
	I'd have to rename each and every HTTP address, which would be a real pain. 
	But if I did the same for "<font face="courier, courier new">/index_template.html</font>" 
	I wouldn't have to rename anything, as long as I kept the logic of directories 
	and indexes straight.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<a name="projectindex"></a> 
<h4>The Project Index Page</h4>
<p>SourceCast has transformed some of the features of the project index page, 
	or homepage. The most important: we no longer use a table to represent all the 
	mailing lists, archives, and subscription information. Instead, the top navbar 
	has a link that more than adequately provides this information. See below, <a href="#samplepage">Sample 
	Page</a>, for a more or less typical index page. You can also go directly to 
	the project index page template: <a href="index_template.html">http://www.openoffice.org/styles/index_template.html</a>.</p>
<p>As well, the project owner's name is now automatically generated by SourceCast, 
	meaning that you do not have to provide it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="templates"></a> 
<h4>Index Page Templates</h4>
<p>An &quot;index page&quot; is the homepage of a directory. It is what is delivered 
	when someone enters, say, &quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot;. The server 
	will look for the index page and serve it up; if it is lacking, nothing will 
	happen. SourceCast allows you to configure your index page while you are creating 
	a project, or even to use the HTML text that you enter in a box in the project 
	creation page. But for better homepages (and ones that will more reliably be 
	served up), we recommend you create and load to CVS an index page.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you intend on using the SourceCast provision or creating 
	an index page, the same question obtains: What should you put on your index 
	page? Enough so that visitors and prospective developers will know something 
	about the project, the goals, the things that have to be done. Accordingly, 
	I have created an <a href="index_template.html" target="_blank">index page template</a>. 
	It is for generic projects, and has sections for statements about the mission 
	of the project, history, a table for to-dos or modules, and so on. Configure 
	it by deleting or duplicating some elements. </p>
<p><b>Note.</b> SourceCast has made it trivially easy to subscribe and unsubscribe 
	to mailing lists and to view and search mailing list archives. Visitors need 
	only click on the &quot;Mailing Lists&quot; link on the project's top navbar 
	to view the options. However, consider encouraging participation in the project 
	by having a brief description of the mailing lists, and what they are about. 
	You need not have links for subscribing or viewing archives, as those are taken 
	care of by the project navbar Mailing List link.</p>
<p>The template below should provide you with a quick means of starting a new 
	index page. If, however, you prefer to create your index page using StarOffice 
	or OpenOffice.org, please at least follow the conventions described above and 
	presented below. To use this, simply </p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index_template.html" target="_blank">Generic project index template</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="samplepage"></a>Sample: Viewed as HTML</h4>
<p>If you are curious about how the above page looks like in &quot;HTML,&quot; 
	the below Whiteboard index template exemplifies how simple the coding is. </p>

<br>
<h3>Tables<a name="tables"></a></h3>
<p>We have two primary table structures. One is simpler than the other; use it 
	when you have fewer headings to cover. Depending on the nature of the information 
	to be displayed, it can consist of two nested tables: the outside table provides 
	the border, the inside the data. The more complex table has no border and uses 
	only one table to supply the content. </p>
<br>
<h4>The Simple Table<a name="simpunbordered"></a></h4>
<p>Most of our tables are of a simple design and are unbordered. That is, the 
	border is either left blank </p>
<p>Not all of our tables have borders. Indeed, most of our tables do not have 
	borders. The logic that determines your aesthetic decision: the nature of the 
	information that must be represented in the table. A table needing a header 
	and column heads will not need the border. The final call, however, is up to 
	you. For what it is worth, mailing list tables (such as the example below) have 
	no borders, but informational tables, such as news tables, do. As a rule, avoid 
	replicating information, e.g., don't have a table title outside the table and 
	also within the table, as a heading.</p>
<br>
<h4>Sample: The Simple Table<a name="simpunbsample"></a> </h4>
<br>
<p>From the homepage of the <a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/">UDK</a> Project, 
	I have taken a sample table that is neatly laid out. The same table, with the 
	HTML coding shown, is displayed <a href="#simpsamphtml">below</a>. (By the way: 
	the legacy trend is to center the heading, etc.; I am moving away from that, 
	and urging all to position the headers on the left.)<br>

<p> A nested table consists of at least two tables, an exterior, bordered table,
	and an interior table with invisible borders; this is where the content is. 
	The basic colors and styles of the nested table are like the simple, un-nested 
	table. The advantage of nesting tables lies, then, in that you can create a 
	bordered table with cell demarcators that differ from the exteriors. This can 
	be quite useful.</p>
<br>
<h4>Table Formatting, Exterior, General<a name="extformatting1"></a> </h4>
<ul>
	<li>Width: 100% </li>
	<li>Height: Leave blank; in pixels </li>
	<li>Cell pad: 0</li>
	<li>Cell space: 0</li>
	<li>Align: Default</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b>: The border for the above table is not set; you can, for your particular 
	table, however, set it to &quot;1&quot; and make the exterior color light blue: 
	&quot;#99CCFF. </p>
<br>
<h4>Table Formatting, Exterior, Particulars<a name="extformatting2"></a> </h4>
<blockquote> 
	<p>This external table includes a row for the header. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Header text: White (#ffffff), bold, no formatting. Size: you can alter 
			this by shrinking it to -1; that call is up to you. </li>
		<li>Heading background: Dark blue (#00315A)<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a><br>
	<br>
	<br>
<h4>Table Formatting: Interior Table<a name="formattingint1"></a> </h4>
<p>The interior table is a regular table with the border set to 0 or left blank. 
	This way, you can organize information in a tabular fashion without having the 
	borders of the cells interrupt your aesthetic. The rule is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make your table, setting border = 0 or leave it blank. (There is a difference 
		in the settings. Play around a little; I prefer to set the border to blank.)</li>
	<li>Position the interior table within the exterior table and set the width 
		= 100%; leave the height blank, in pixels. The interior table should map perfectly 
		to the limits of the exterior table. </li>
	<li>You can also do other things to accomplish the same effect, such as coloring 
		the cells, etc. Experiment; it's a pleasant way to use up time<br>
		<br>
	</li>
</ol>
<h4>Interior Table Particulars<a name="inttableparts"></a></h4>
<blockquote> 
	<p>The interior table above has the following characteristics:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Border = 0</li>
		<li>Cell Pad = 2 (you can raise it; lowering it is not recommended)</li>
		<li>Cell Space = 0 or leave blank</li>
		<li>Content background: Pale blue (#fofofo) (as will all tables)</li>
		<li>Content text: Black, default font, no formatting. Size: you can shrink 
			the size to -1; that call is up to you.</li>

<h4>Sample Nested Table <a name="sampnestedtable"></a></h4>
<p>Here is a sample nested table. It may be easier to add content to the interior 
	table first, then cut and paste the completed interior table into the exterior 
	table shell. So, I've split them up.</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#99ccff" cellspacing="0">
	<tr bgcolor="#ffffff" bordercolor="#99ccff"> 
		<td height="16" bordercolor="#99ccff" bgcolor="#00315A"><font size="-1" color="#ffffff"><b>[Your 
			heading here]</b></font></td>
	</tr>

<h3>Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a></h3>
<h4>Another style guide<a name="otherguide"></a></h4>
<p>Todd Fahner has created a brief but beautifully clear <a href="http://collabnet.cleverchimp.com/notes/prodstandards/" target="_blank">style 
	guide</a> that also explains how to use style sheets. It is still a work in 
	progress, so be sure to check back on it periodically, but I heartily recommend 
	it.</p>
<p>And, if you have any questions, or wish to add (reasonable) material, please

*Makes drawing business processes and diagrams a snap!*

**Draw** - from a quick sketch to a complex plan, Draw gives you the tools
to communicate with graphics and diagrams. With a maximum page size of 300cm by
300cm, Draw is powerful tool for technical or general posters, etc.

'Park' your most commonly used drawing tools around your screen ready for
single-click access.

Use *Styles and Formatting* to put all your graphics styles at your finger tips.

*Manipulate objects*, rotate in two or three dimensions; the *3D controller* allows you to create
spheres, rings, cubes, etc. in a quick pinch.

*Arrange objects*, group, ungroup, regroup, and edit objects while grouped.
Sophisticated *rendering* let you create photorealistic images with your own
texture, lighting effects, transparency, perspective, and so on.

*Smart connectors* make short work of flowcharts, organization charts, network
diagrams, etc. Define your own 'glue points' for connectors to 'stick' to.

*Dimension lines* automatically calculate and display linear dimensions as you
draw.

Use the picture *Gallery* for clipart; you can also create your own art and add it to the
Gallery.

Save your graphics in OpenDocument format, the new international standard for
office documents. This XML based format means you're not tied into using Draw.
You can access your graphics from any OpenDocument compliant software.

*Import graphics* from all common formats (including BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF,
and WMF).

Use Draw's free feature to create Flash (.swf) versions of your work.

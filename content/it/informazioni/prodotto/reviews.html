<h3>Keynote Review</h3>

<p>
<b>PC Pro Magazine</b>
delivers its verdict on Version 1.1.2: <cite>The
best all-round office suite is also the cheapest. With excellent
Microsoft compatibility, a consistent interface and a good network of
ad-hoc support, this is the king of the business tools.</cite><br />

OpenOffice.org tops the poll and earns <img src="reviews_files/6stars.gif" alt="six stars" border="0" height="10" width="69" /> in a comparative
review of office suites in <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/labs/64884/openoffice-112.html">Issue
224, December 04</a>. The magazine's
review team conclude that they <cite>fully
endorse OpenOffice over and above Microsoft Office 2003 for both home
and corporate use.</cite></p>

Office 12 </a>Vol. 11 Issue 23 | 23 September - 6 October 2005 <b>Compterworld</b>
    <cite>
The industry's two major office suites, Microsoft Office and
OpenOffice.org, will soon be releasing new versions. Recent research
into these versions by large government departments indicates that for
many sites, it is now 10 times cheaper to migrate to the new
OpenOffice.org 2.0 than upgrading to Microsoft Office 12.</cite> </li>

is great alternative to Microsoft</a>
by Andy Ihnatko, September 22, 2005 <b>Chicago
Sun-Times</b> <cite>...you
won't use it because you hate Microsoft or because you
don't like tying your whole office's (or your government's) ability to
function to the proprietary whims of one single company. Maybe you
won't even use it just because it'll cost you $0 to Microsoft Office's
$365. You'll use it because OpenOffice 2.0 is an attractive and
compelling suite of office apps in its own right.</cite> </li>

original version, version 2.0 of this free productivity suite is
surprisingly slick and highly compatible with Microsoft Office file

It even offers features not found in its expensive Microsoft

2 - a new, improved version that gives Microsoft a run for its money</a>
By Cliff Joseph, 22 Jul 2005 <b>Personal
Computer World </b> <cite>...there's
no doubt version 2 is more than powerful enough for most home and
business users and can certainly give Microsoft a run for its money,
especially since it's free.</cite> </li>

By Simon London Published: April 21 2005 03:00 <b>Financial

forward to OpenOffice.org 2.0</a>
Joe Brockmeier, 5 Jan 2003, <b>Linux
Weekly News</b> <cite>From
a test of the 1.9.65 build, it's pretty clear that the OpenOffice.org
project has a way to go before it's finished. However, this release
does provide a pretty good overview of what to expect, and it does look
like 2.0 will be a formidable suite when finished.</cite> </li>

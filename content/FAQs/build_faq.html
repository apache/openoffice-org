available

close as
possible to the open source norm, the complexity and size of the
application

      <td>Release Engineering in Sun do a full build of StarOffice once
a week, in
an optimised environment. On successful completion of the full build,
the
latest solver is made available to all developers. Developers build
their
CVS module(s) against the current solver. After code changes,
developers
build the CVS module(s) and "deliver" the shared headers, shared
libraries
and binaries to their copy of the current solver for testing.
      <p>Incompatible changes are allowed between full builds. So that
incompatible
work is not mixed, the name of each shared library/DLL includes the
build
number, which is incremented by one each week.
      </p>
      <p>In order to assist the OpenOffice.org community, Sun plan to
provide a similar
environment because the code base is so large and current developers
use
this. Sun intend to provide one tarball of solver for each of a number
of platforms on a regular basis on www.OpenOffice.org. These will be
known
as milestones.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore the proposed process for development will be :
      <br>
1. Developer downloads milestone solver tarball for given platform
      <br>
2. CVS checkout of the relevant project for the same milestone
      <br>
3. Change code
      <br>
4. Build. (This will build against the contents of solver and, on
successful
completion, deliver the results to solver.)
      <br>
5. Test the new version.
      <br>
6. Submit patch
      </p>
      <p>OpenOffice.org has a large code base. CVS is used as a
synchronisation mechanism
between development teams. API changes in low level CVS modules are
checked
in to give higher level
modules a chance to reflect these. Between (incompatible) milestone
builds it's a common circumstance that API changes have started in low
level modules and not all modules using these APIs have been changed
already. Therefore, the build using the head
revision build may not always be successful.
      </p>
      <p>A new methodology is being introduced now. Head may be a
buildable master workspace shortly.

          <p>For *nix - there are lots, but others recommend kvirc

          <p>then, once your client is up, you can type in the

1 Introduction</H1>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Lutz Hoeger, July 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This document provides a
comprehensive, high-level overview of concepts for features in the
next release of StarOffice / OpenOffice.org (SO/OOo) currently in the
planning phase.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The specification for such a large
project covers many areas and many details.  Consequently, it will
not provide a complete list of all the details, but occasionally will
include some details to aid in clarifying the discussion. Many more
details have already been and will soon be submitted as feature
issues in IssueZilla, completing the picture.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In compiling this document, we've
gathered feedback from users, developers and existing or potential
customers: in direct communication at trade shows like Linux World,
during events like the OpenOffice.org Conference, using surveys, and
last but not least in discussions on the OpenOffice.org mailing
lists. We then put together ideas to respond to these requirements,
prioritized them, and finally assembled it all into the Product
Concept. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">During the prioritization for this
release, we had to strike a balance between the importance of each
requirement and the goal of an 18-month cycle for releases. We've
learned from discussion, particularly with enterprise customers, that
this is their expected &ldquo;heartbeat&rdquo; for major releases of
an office productivity suite.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The structure of this document
provides different levels of detail  about the concept:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The Executive Summary (0.5
  pages) is ideal for a &ldquo;Got-only-5-minutes-hurry-up!&rdquo;
  reader who wants to know what the overall direction is. It's a brief
  description of our answers to the highest priority requirements.
  This section contains neither any details  nor a full list of areas
  we plan to work on. 
  </P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The Concept Overview section
  (five pages) explains the prioritization and discusses all
  requirement areas.  This section should provide a good &ldquo;30-minute&rdquo;
  overview of the responses to the requirements.  While leaving out
  many of the details, it covers all the areas.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And finally, the Detailed
  Concept section (about 20 pages) completes the previous section with
  a much more detailed view into all aspects of the requirements, with
  some background information if available, and even illustrates parts
  of the concept by drilling down on some details.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Before beginning, let me introduce
one convention used throughout this document. Code name &ldquo;Geordi&rdquo;
stands for SO/OOo 1.1, and &ldquo;Q&rdquo; for the next major release
after 1.1.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">And one final note, you'll find the
document chapters tagged with different author names reflecting that
many people contributed to this document.  We all would be happy to
get your feedback.  So if you want to tell us something we could have
done better, we may have forgotten or just want to ask a question,
please refer in your comments to the section on which you are
commenting.  This will help us identify the person who can best
respond to  your feedback.</P>

2 Executive Summary</H1>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Lutz Hoeger, July 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; will be the next
major release of StarOffice / OpenOffice.org (SO/OOo).  Listed below
are the concepts to address the key requirements of our existing and
potential customers. These CTQs (Critical to Quality) are all
centered around the main theme:  migration to &ldquo;Q&rdquo;.</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Lower cost of interoperability
  with Microsoft Office.  By providing better interoperability with
  Microsoft Office, &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will significantly decrease the
  cost of conversion between the two applications.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Lower cost of retraining<BR>&ldquo;Q&rdquo;
  will lower the training needs for average users by enhancing feature
  areas toward better standards of interaction.  This will make the
  migration to SO/OOo cheaper.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Better Performance<BR>&ldquo;Q&rdquo;
  will come with noticeable improvements in startup performance as
  well as time to open or save a document.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">General usability
  improvements<BR>Redesigning parts of &ldquo;Q&rdquo; to increase
  usability will increase productivity of the average user and the
  overall level of satisfaction when working with the product.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Enhanced programmability<BR>&ldquo;Q&rdquo;
  will make it easier to automate typical office suite tasks. By
  improved extensibility, &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will be better customizable
  to individual customer's needs.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Better integration into desktop
  systems<BR>Particularly on Gnome desktop systems, &ldquo;Q&rdquo;
  will integrate better with the existing infrastructure. This leads
  to a more intuitive use of &ldquo;Q&rdquo; for users who are already
  familiar with the desktop system, and provides better
  interoperability between SO/OOo and other desktop applications.</P>
</UL>
<H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.Concept%20Overview|outline"></A>
3 Concept Overview</H1>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This section explains the
prioritization and provides a general overview about all concept
areas. More details are given in section 4, Concept Details.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The priorities used in this concept
have been set according to the general guidelines of priorities from
different bug tracking systems, including IssueZilla. Although the
<SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT SIZE=3>latter</FONT></SPAN> doesn't
specifically exclude feature issues from having priority 1, a P1
issue normally means that an area is broken and cannot be worked
with. Typically P1 is reserved for bugs only. That's why the scale
for requirement priorities ranks from P2 (highest) to P5 (lowest). We
assigned them in the following way.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.1.Key%20Drivers%20(P2)|outline"></A>
3.1 Key Drivers (P2)</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The overarching motto and strategy
for this release is to lower the barrier for customers to migrate to
StarOffice/OpenOffice.org (SO/OOo). Our concept addresses this at
various levels, in different areas of the product. The following
areas describe the key drivers for &ldquo;Q&rdquo; - the areas that
we hear about most in our customer research. These are the areas with
highest priority and also often the highest effort in development
engineering. 
</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.1.1.Microsoft%20Office%20Interoperability|outline"></A>
3.1.1 Microsoft Office Interoperability</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Dieter Loeschky, April 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Interoperability between Microsoft
Office and SO/OOo is generally influenced by three factors.  The
first factor is the quality of the filter component, that is, the
quality of the component that translates the content and structure of
a Microsoft Office document into the content and structure of a
SO/OOo document.  The second factor is the compatibility of the
feature set of the application in Microsoft Office versus the
corresponding SO/OOo application.  The third factor is the behavior
or interpretation of features that exist in both applications.  Even
if another application and SO/OOo both support a certain feature,
there might be differences in the way the feature is actually
applied, so that documents in fact might look different although they
have exactly the same values stored for the feature within their text
engines. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">One (already resolved) example of
this is the upper paragraph margin that exists in Microsoft Word and
SO/OOo Writer. The <SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT SIZE=3>latter</FONT></SPAN>,
like many DTP and professional word processing applications, ignores
this value for the first paragraph of a page. Microsoft Word does
not. The result of this is that the documents look different,
although exactly the same values are stored in both text engines.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.1.2.Usability|outline"></A>
3.1.2 Usability</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Matthias Mueller-Prove, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; will change its
overall appearance in order to improve the usability for the majority
of non-SO/OOo customers. These changes affect the menu structure, the
toolbar User Interface, the terminology, and finally the overall
window layout. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In general, usability is about task
conformance, familiarity, predictability, flexibility, robustness,
customizability, and learnability. Several minor usability
improvements support the usability of SO/OOo in aspects of these
usability qualities. All new features will be evaluated against these
qualities by the Sun StarOffice User Experience Team.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Task conformance pushes us to
reconsider the necessary steps for an action and reduce the number of
mouse clicks in &ldquo;Q&rdquo; as much as possible.  Predictability
demands that we strive for a consistent user interface.  We will
provide a conceptual model that is predictable and consistent for all
SO/OOo applications instead of conforming with the majority of
competing applications.  On the other hand, predictability calls for
conformance with styleguides for the target platforms.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.1.3.Performance|outline"></A>
3.1.3 Performance</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Matthias Huetsch, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo will improve its performance
in four areas that are especially important to customers.  The two
most visible areas of improvement will be decreasing the Startup Time
and Document Open/Save Time.  The third area of improvement will be
Responsiveness in rendering more complex drawing objects as they, for
example, occur in presentations. The fourth area is in the
Scalability of large scale multi-user deployments like on Citrix,
Tarantella, and SunRay servers. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The performance improvements in the
first three areas were identified as being mostly of an architectural
nature.  Significant improvement in any of these areas can be
achieved through either refactoring the current architecture, or
replacing architecture.  The fourth area of scalability issues 
originates in a number of areas that can be addressed individually.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.1.4.Programmability|outline"></A>
3.1.4 Programmability</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Kay Ramme, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Programmability describes the
possibility of usinge SO/OOo or parts of it in custom solutions
programmatically. The underlying technology for SO/OOo
programmability is the SO/OOo component model UNO (Universal Network
Objects) and the SO/OOo API .   &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will make it easier
on many levels to create solutions utilizing UNO and SO/OOo's API. 
This will be achieved through improved language bindings, IDE
integration, easier deployment of add-on components into a SO/OOo
installation, and a new scripting framework that allows use of other
languages in addition to BASIC for scripting purposes.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.1.5.Integration%20into%20Gnome%20Desktop%20and%20Microsoft%20Windows|outline"></A>
3.1.5 Integration into Gnome Desktop and Microsoft Windows</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Christof Pintaske, June 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The overall requirement is to provide
an easy to use desktop with an appealing and modern Look and Feel
that is consistent throughout all applications.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">To achieve a better system
integration, &quot;Q&quot; will make increased use of information and
infrastructure that is provided with the Gnome desktop instead of
creating platform independent solutions. 
</P>

<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.2.General%20Improvements%20(P3)|outline"></A>
3.2 General Improvements (P3)</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The next areas are still mandatory
requirements.  They fall under general improvements, that help
facilitate a successful deployment of SO/OOo.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="3.2.1.Stability%20and%20Quality|outline"></A>
3.2.1 Stability and Quality</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Matthias Huetsch, June 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; improves stability
and quality by  addressing the response to SO/OOo crashes with
unsaved documents, which can  result in lost data. Currently, SO/OOo
performs an emergency backup of those documents only. Upon next
startup, a Document Recovery dialog then offers to restore those
documents to a previously known good state.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The probability of data loss due to a
crash will be reduced by augmenting the current emergency backup with
regular backup copies of documents.  The Document Recovery dialog
will be improved by providing more guidance and feedback while
restoring documents. An Error Report tool, available in the &ldquo;Geordi&rdquo;

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">With regard to deployment, &quot;Geordi&quot;
offers a platform independent installation process, which can not
easily be managed by any kind of management software.  Instead of
adding additional management capabilities in this area, SO/OOo &quot;Q&quot;
changes the installation process. The platform independent
installation is replaced by the support for standard, platform
dependent installation routines - so called native installers - and
their native installation packages. These are the Solaris Package
(pkg) installation, the Linux RPM package manager (RPM) installation,
and the Microsoft Installer (MSI) installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The advantage of this approach is to

</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Digital signatures themselves are a
relatively new topic for office applications. The requirement to
protect data from being modified has existed for many years ,
however.  In the past, it has been addressed by features that
protected documents from being edited within the office application.
With digital signatures, these features will be enhanced to offer
secure protection of document content, inside SO/OOo, and outside of
it.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Encryption is a feature that has been
supported by office applications for a long time.  Enhancement in
this area mainly affected the encryption algorithm themselves, to
make them more secure. However, since there was no standardized way
in which encryption algorithms are applied to documents, processing
such documents outside an office application was complex.  By
supporting new XML encryption standards, and due to SO/OOo's XML file
format, this will become much easier.</P>

improvements and new features for SO/OOo, this section is reserved

4.1.1 Improving Microsoft Office Interoperability</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Dieter Loeschky, April 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In the past, interoperability between
Microsoft Office and SO/OOo was improved by completing the import and
export filters.  In &quot;Geordi&quot; interoperability between
Microsoft Office and SO/OOo was improved by also adding features to
SO/OOo and by changing SO/OOo's behavior and interpretation of single
features. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, interoperability
will be improved in a very large scale by continuing to add features
to SO/OOo.  Changes in the filters are of course still required to
support the new features or changed behavior.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The movement of effort from the
filter development into the application development is in fact a very
natural process. At a certain stage, interoperability of a certain
feature cannot be improved by the filter any longer, because it
already converts all data that is supported from one application to
the other. At this point, if the feature still behaves differently,
the SO/OOo  application itself may be enhanced.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.1.1 SO/OOo Writer</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For SO/OOo Writer, there are four
main areas in which interoperability with Microsoft Office will be
improved:  tables, drawing objects, numberings/bullets and spacing.
The improvements in these main areas will be completed by many other
small enhancements in other areas that also raise interoperability
issues.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Tables</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The most important improvement will
be the support of automatic page breaks within cells. Currently, this
can cause significant differences in layout of the same document
between a non-SO/OOo application and SO/OOo Writer if the document
contains tables that do not fit on a single page. Two other important
improvements will be the support of tables within tables and of
tables where text flows around them. Table interoperability will be
completed by a border model that provides better interoperability
with other applications, including Microsoft Word.  Interoperability 
improvements mentioned above are considered to be a much higher
priority than those that can be achieved by introducing a different
table model.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Drawing objects</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A second very important area where
interoperability will be improved is in SO/OOo drawing objects. The
most important improvement will be supporting other applications'
drawing objects within page headers and footers. In addition to this,
missing alignment, anchoring and position modes will be added.
Finally, there will be a unification of drawing objects and SO/OOo
Writer's so called fly frames, i.e. graphic, text box and OLE
objects. Many options that are available for frames will be made
available to drawing objects as well and vice versa. The user
interface of both kind of objects will also be unified.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Numbering and bullets</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Interoperability of numberings and
bullets, the third main area mentioned above, will also be addressed
by many small enhancements. Negative indents will be supported and it
will be possible to change the indent values for every paragraph
individually. Tabulators will be supported within numbers. Last but
not least, the the calculation of chapter numbers and table of
contents will be enhanced.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Spacing</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The fourth important area for
improvement can be summarized by the word &ldquo;spacing.&rdquo;
Although the differences are very small (typically less than half a
point) and will hardly be noticed by the user, the end result might
be that an imported page contains two lines less of text on a SO/OOo
Writer page. This again can result in images and text boxes appearing
on different pages, and the document may look completely different in
SO/OOo Writer.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.1.2 SO/OOo Calc</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Most interoperability problems
between Microsoft Excel and SO/OOo Calc that exist today result from
an incompatible feature set.  The biggest advance in interoperability
can be achieved by adding new and changing existing features in Calc
to achieve better compatibility.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Breaking the row limit</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently, 32,000 is the maximum
number of rows in a Calc spreadsheet.  Cell content beyond row 32,000
is lost when a file with more rows is imported into SO/OOo. If more
than 32,000 rows are needed for a specific spreadsheet, there's no
easy way to get equivalent results using only SO/OOo's 32,000 rows.
It is therefore important to adjust our row limit. The number of rows
in a spreadsheet will be increased to 65,536, with provisions to make
it relatively easy to further increase that number in later versions.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Calculation</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The second important issue is
calculation. Although the set of formula functions is very similar
across most spreadsheet applications, some special-case features of
calculation with these functions are not yet supported in SO/OOo.
Currently, when documents that use these additional features are
loaded in SO/OOo, the formula cells will show error values or even
different results from those in the original document.  To get the
same results as in the original, the spreadsheets would have to be
changed manually.  Especially in the case of array formulas, these
required changes would be quite extensive, making it difficult to
create an equivalent calculation in SO/OOo.  We have identified a set
of features that cause problems.They will be addressed in <SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Q&quot;</FONT></SPAN>.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Form controls</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Another important feature that will
be added to SO/OOo is the ability to create form controls (list
boxes, check boxes, etc.) that are connected to spreadsheet cells.
These controls get their values from the cells, and update the cells
if something is selected. With the increased flexibility that will be
needed to support the form layer's own new features, we will be able
to also implement this connection to spreadsheet cells.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Cell attributes</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo supports slightly different
cell attributes than competing applications.  This leads to
differences in the appearance or behavior of imported documents that
contain these attributes.  We will add corresponding features to
SO/OOo to eliminate the differences in imported documents.  We will
extend the validation feature, annotations, scenarios, ranges and
hyperlinks, as well as some cell formatting attributes. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">DataPilot</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently, basic functionality and
interoperability is available in SO/OOo's DataPilot.  In <SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Q&quot;</FONT></SPAN>,
we will extend the DataPilot to the state-of-the-art feature set for
reports based on spreadsheet cell data. The most important of these
features are page fields, settings for fields and individual
elements, and the table formatting options.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Sorting</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Finally, it's common amongst the
competing applications to preserve as much of the original sorting
order as possible, when sorting a spreadsheet according by some sort
keys. In SO/OOo they end up in a random order. We can change the
implementation of sorting so that the original order is preserved
where sorting criteria are equal.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.1.3 SO/OOo Impress</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;Geordi&quot; improved
interoperability with Microsoft PowerPoint in many aspects.  To
further improve interoperability completely new features need to be
added to the application and the drawing layer.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Build effects</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The current animation system of
SO/OOo Impress supports one effect per shape with all effect types
individually implemented. Execution of all effects is either
automatic or manually per slide. Users request to have an equivalent
set of effects and to preserve the order of execution of effects when
exchanging presentations between SO/OOo Impress and non-SO/OOo
applications. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Instead of manually implementing
every new shape effect, it is necessary to support an animation core
that is flexible to handle new effects that may be added later. The
first step is to add a core component that can fully load and store
non-SO/OOo effects for improved interoperability.  Due to the higher
demands for hardware supported rendering this first step will not be
visually equal on all effects. Also playing the effects in real time
will not be solved by this. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Timeline</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">To support a timeline concept, there
will be a timeline feature for SO/OOo Impress. With this timeline,
interoperability is enhanced by preserving the order and timing by
which the shape effects are executed. Users will be able to add more
than one effect to each shape and to have effects that are partly
automatic and partly triggered by mouse clicks. <BR>This will also
include a user interface to change the new introduced timeline and
effect features. &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will also provide a shortcut, for
the user to select an animation theme for a slide, so that the slide
and shape effects are automatically set to fit the theme.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Collaboration</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Interoperability with other
presentation programs, including Microsoft PowerPoint, will be
improved by adding means to use sticky note like comments in Impress.
 Currently, upon import, SO/OOo Impress ignores this information. 
This improvement will enhance interoperability by preserving document
content and by giving SO/OOo Impress users who need to interoperate
with other application users the ability to exchange comments on
their work.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Header and Footers</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Sometimes headers and footers in
Impress presentation slides get lost during a roundtrip from
Microsoft PowerPoint to SO/OOo Impress.  The reason for this is the
different way headers and footers are used in Microsoft PowerPoint
and SO/OOo Impress.  The SO/OOo Impress method for using headers and
footers is much more flexible than Microsoft PowerPoint's.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">To meet this requirement and to
improve ease of use, SO/OOo Impress will provide easier access to
it's header and footer feature. This will not only enhance
interoperability by keeping header and footer information persistent,
but will also provide the user with an easier interface to create
them in SO/OOo Impress. There will also be an easy to use dialog to
change the header and footer for the current page or for all pages.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Extended Drawing Shapes</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Often drawing shapes, such as 
&ldquo;AutoShapes&rdquo; in Microsoft PowerPoint, can be found in
competing presentation program applications.  They provide an easy
way of adding drawings to presentations. Therefore a set of
predefined shapes of different categories like 'block arrows', 'flow
charts', 'stars and banners', 'callouts' and 'action buttons' can be
provided. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For example, in the current version
of SO/OOo, imported  Microsoft Office documents that contain
Autoshapes are mostly displayed correctly.  There does not exist,
however, the ability to edit WordArt objects or to change 3D-objects.
 Interchanging documents between SO/OOo and Microsoft Office leads to
the loss of  functionality of these drawing objects.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">To meet this requirement, an
implementation for extended drawing objects in SO/OOo will be
designed, including new dialogs to edit imported WordArt objects and
to change imported 3D objects. This will not only enhance
interoperability through supporting all Microsoft Office AutoShapes,
but make them fully editable and allow SO/OOo Impress users to create
functionally equal drawing shapes themselves.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.1.4 SO/OOo Base (Forms)</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">An evolving standard for data entry
applications are W3C's XForms. XForm controls can be embedded into
any XML based file format like XHTML, and they support data entry
based on XML schemes. It is likely that XForms will replace at least
HTML/HTTP forms in the mid term future. By adding XForms support to
SO/OOo, it will not only keep up with recent development trends, but
in combination with the OASIS OpenOffice XML file format it also
becomes a powerful alternative to XHTML/XForms. What makes it
interesting to use an OASIS OpenOffice XML and XForms based SO/OOo as
a data entry client is that it offers much more layout capabilities
than XHTML/XForms based clients, but uses exactly the same open
protocols as XHTML/XForms based clients on the server side. Moreover,
since SO/OOo is also a powerful tool to create forms, even form
creation gets easier and does not require additional tools.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">While XForms are already an
improvement for data entry applications, it is conceivable that data
entry applications will improve further. In some of the recently
developed applications, data entry is not limited to classical form
controls, but arbitrary text or other content can by included into
the form data. Additionally, some applications provide the ability to
extend forms at run time. An example for this are meeting minutes,
where an agenda item might be duplicated any times. These
capabilities allow it to use data entry applications not only for
static and simple forms, but also for such complex things like
minutes, bills or letters. In any case, the actual form data will
stay in an XML schema. These schema could be either a user defined
one, or one that is standardized by organizations like OASIS. In the
later category are the UBL schemes that are currently developed by an
OASIS technical committee. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In such scenarios, the user creates
new documents based on existing document  templates. In the new
document, data can be entered only at predefined locations, for
instance within certain fields, controls or text boxes. Moreover only
very few editing features will be enabled. For instance, text
sections might be duplicated but not inserted at any location. This
way, it can be ensured that the document always has a defined
structure. This again allows it to bind every editable data to
elements of an XML schema and therefor to submit them as XML form
data.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo capabilities for such form
based work flows will be improved. The starting point is the XForm
enhancements described above. Further steps will be the inclusion of
for instance field or paragraph contents into XML form data and
possibilities to enter data into them in Writer's read only mode. The
capabilities to specify application behavior within templates will be
improved. Finally, certain complex editing operations, like
duplicating a section, will be allowed in Writer's read only mode as
well. By adding data entry capabilities to SO/OOo step by step, more
and more work flows can be implemented with SO/OOo. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo will also improve its
interoperability with the form functionality of Microsoft Office, in
particular of Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word features two completely
different concepts for form functionality: form fields and form
controls. Form fields are the more ancient concept and are not
supported by &quot;Geordi&quot;, but are nevertheless frequently used
by Microsoft Word users. SO/OOo will address this by implementing
equivalents for these form fields.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Form controls offer a functionality
similar to form controls in SO/OOo applications. For &ldquo;Q&rdquo;,
we will implement some new control types like scroll bars, toggle
buttons, and a rich text control, and enhance existing control types
with functionality currently not present, for example multi-columnar

added to the Chart core.  This added functionality will ease Bug
fixing and integration of new features.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The most important feature that will
be added will allow data series to get their input from individual
cell-ranges for x-values, y-values, labels, etc. Without it, some
imports from non-SO/OOo spreadsheets can only produce an empty
output.  Technically, this requires new interfaces for the
communication between SO/OOo Chart and either SO/OOo Calc or SO/OOo
Writer.  Moreover, the source data concept within the SO/OOo Chart
needs to be redesigned completely.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Some new chart types have to be
integrated too &ndash; especially bubble and surface charts. A bubble
chart requires an additional input range for the bubble sizes. As
this additional range does not fit into the current source data
structure the new source data concept mentioned above is a
prerequisite for offering a bubble chart  as well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Moreover, the integration of a new
chart type into the old SO/OOo Chart core could jeopardize existing
functionality, as chart type dependent code is spread over the whole
project. To eliminate this fundamental problem a new SO/OOo Chart
core will encapsulate chart type dependent code in separate UNO
components with well defined interfaces.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The re-implementation of the SO/OOo
Chart core is a necessary, long-lasting task that has to be finished
before any of the requested new features can be started. The
re-implementation of the current functionality is expected to take at
least until the end of the calendar year.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The missing features for

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.2.1 Menu Structure</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The redesign of the menu structure
will take the general concepts of the competing applications into
account. Two prominent examples of menu changes for &ldquo;Q&rdquo;
are the organization of menu items of the View menu and a new Table
menu for Writer.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.2.2 Toolbars</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The user interface of toolbars will
be completely redesigned. &ldquo;Q&rdquo; provides for small toolbars
that can be rearranged with drag'n'drop. The new design makes better
use of the screen estate by using the space more efficiently. The
dynamic exchange of toolbar content will be eliminated.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.2.3 Terminology</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The terminology used for the user

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.2.4 Window Layout</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Impress will get a new window layout

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.2.5 Application Separation</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For the user, &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will
also look more like separate applications. The Microsoft Windows

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.2.7 Usability of the Database
application</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Frank Schoenheit, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently, the database access (DBA)
functionality in SO/OOo exposes various differences from other
database applications.  Those differences can be assigned to two
groups:  usability and interoperability.  These issues are
predominant with users who are not able to locate the functionality
they need (though often it is present).  They then do not feel
comfortable with SO/OOo's user interface which follows a different
philosophy in this area.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Additionally, having a competitive
database application, instead of a set of database access components,
clearly is an important feature for potential users and customers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will address this with a redesign
of SO/OOo's database application.  In the first instance, this will
lead to it being recognized as a state-of-the-art end user oriented
database application, and make former users of other database
products, like Microsoft Access, feel more comfortable.  In the
second instance, it will address most of the problems customers have
with the current user interface.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A New Database Application</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo DBA (with a new name which is
to be discussed) will be an own application, instead of hiding within
Writer, Calc and Impress documents. This will be perceived as a
competitive database application then, which will be equal to the
other major applications in SO/OOo.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This new application will be
accessible from the main menu &ndash; File|New  is where users expect
to create a new database, so we will add a Database item, which opens
the application and offers the user a reasonable set of choices how
to proceed (e.g. create a dBase data source,  connect to an existing
foreign database via an auto pilot).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will not abandon the concept of
data sources.  This is not only for reasons of feasibility (a
database engine is a very heavy-weight project), but also for reasons
of openness: We continue SO/OOo's philosophy to allow the user to
work with whatever database is already present in her work
environment, from client-side single-user file-based databases up to
server-side databases participating in a corporate work flow.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The layout and user interface of this
new application will, at the first glance, be recognized as
relatively similar to what typical database application users already
know. Where it makes sense, the application will provide a look&amp;feel,
including functional concepts, that are intuitive.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">As a consequence of this new database
access application, we will give it its own top-level topic in
SO/OOo's help system.  This will increase the user's ability to find
help with database topics.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The functionality of the current Data
Source Administration dialog, and large parts of the functionality of
the current data source browser, will be merged in the new
application, providing one single entry point for database
functionality in SO/OOo.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Data Sources</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will re-implement the user
interface of SO/OOo DBA. We will move away from the current
technician-oriented user interface to a more end-user oriented work
flow and terminology.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In addition, several measures will be
taken to make the &ldquo;data source&rdquo; concept feel more like
the &ldquo;database&rdquo; concept the user is used to from other
office suites. Though the underlying core concepts will not be
changed, SO/OOo users then will have less problems when migrating
from other database applications.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will change the way that data
sources in SO/OOo are administrated &ndash; we will put more focus on
meeting the user in her own vocabulary of concepts, by creating a
more intuitive user interface, and by exposing most of the technical
details to advanced users only.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">An auto pilot will be created which
allows the import/export of data sources (file based), and thus
migrate them between installations.  This will not only unburden the
user from the manual work which is currently required for this, but
also support the impression of a &ldquo;database&rdquo; in opposite
to a &ldquo;data source&rdquo; which the user cannot really control.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Form Documents</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Form Documents provide a highly
customizable view to database data, thus they are the user's primary
choice when working with such data.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The main improvement desired by
SO/OOo users in the area of form functionality is usability. Thus, we
will make changes to SO/OOo affecting the user interface in several
ways. The user will recognize SO/OOo data-aware forms (which covers
form design as well as form usage) as a dedicated solution, in
opposite to the current situation, where form functionality is
recognized as a small and hidden add-on to SO/OOo text documents.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This list ranges from small and
rather cosmetic changes which will sum up to a much better user
experience, to larger projects such as a dedicated simple mode for
the property browser, which consists of specialized views for the
different object types, and presents only the most often used aspects
of these objects to the user, this way exposing the full power of the
property browser to advanced users only.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Additionally, functionality
enhancements will be made to SO/OOo's form layer.  Included here are
additions to the form controls which are required in the Microsoft
Interoperability Chapter, but also new implementations (such as
real-time filter controls) which will bring SO/OOo nearer to the
current state-of-the-art.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Common Tasks</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will provide the user with more
auto pilots for the most common tasks in the database area,
respectively enhance the existing auto pilots. In SO/OOo &ldquo;Q&rdquo;,
we will have an enhanced report and form auto pilot, and new pilots
for designing new tables, and designing customized data views aka
queries.</P>

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.3.1 Startup Time</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The most visible performance
improvement in SO/OOo will be the substantial shortening of the time
required for first startup, in particular when the system has not
been used for some time or after a system reboot. The improved first
startup time will correspond to the time used by competing
applications.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Generally, the decrease in startup
time will be addressed through refactoring the code and removing the
strong interdependencies between:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Application 'Core', 'User Interface'

</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In combination, these refactoring
actions shall result in loading a relatively lightweight framework
plus the necessary application code and document filters upon
startup, only, and will thus reduce both the startup time as well as
the initial memory consumption.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.3.2 Document Open/Save Time</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The second most visible performance
improvement in SO/OOo will be decreasing the time required for
opening or saving larger documents, in particular for documents in
the native XML format.  This time improvement will be comparable with
competing applications.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo will implement this time
savings with SO/OOo API enhancements that are optimized for XML
import / export and are fully supported by the application internal
implementations.  Code optimizations along the entire import / export
component chain will be evaluated to identify and eliminate
bottlenecks.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This improvement will be addressed
with a redesign of both the graphics toolkit, adding e.g., support

use of double-buffering and other caching techniques.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.3.3 Scalability</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Large scale multi-user deployments in
which possibly hundreds of SO/OOo application instances are running
on a single multi-processor server will be improved beyond what
&ldquo;Geordi&rdquo; already addresses.  Scalability issues can be
summarized and addressed as follows:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">System Load</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A high number of context switches per
second is caused by SO/OOo instances temporarily yielding control to
other processes or threads. This behavior induces a high load on the
system scheduler, and may as well adversely affect the responsiveness
of SO/OOo itself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This will be addressed by giving up
current cooperative and timer based polling concepts in favor of
preemptive and event driven concepts.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Memory Consumption</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The amount of non-shareable memory

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Stephan Bergmann, Daniel Boelzle,
Kai Sommerfeld, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The Office UNO API is very fine
grained. Although this offers maximum flexibility,  programmers often
want to have simplified high-level UNO interfaces. This enables rapid
application development and helps even lower-skilled developers to
reach their goals quickly. To address this problem we need to provide
a new set of task-oriented high-level convenience UNO services.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">UNO defines language independent
concepts like services, interfaces or the Any data type. The binding
to concrete languages often maps these concepts One to One. This is
not always the optimum because it may require the developer to learn
constructs that are unusual or even strange for a certain programming
language. A popular example for this is the queryInterface call,
which should be a simple cast in Java. For the next Office release we
will provide new UNO features which will simplify the usage of UNO in
general or for particular language bindings.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">With the language independent
scripting framework it will be possible to script SO/OOo in any

scripting IDE, which is integrated into SO/OOo and supports multiple
scripting languages including SO/OOo Basic, Java and JavaScript.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The scripting IDE will be based on a

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.1.4.4 .NET Bridge</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Joachim  Lingner, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo uses software bridges in order
to have pieces of code, which may be subjected to certain language-
and runtime specific requirements and restrictions, interact with
each other. For example, Java code or C++ code cannot interact
naturally. The same goes for C++ code compiled with different
compilers. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">All those particular requirements to
a piece of code is referred to as environment and it is said that a
piece of code lives (or runs) in an environment. Now, to have code
from one environment access code in another environment, one needs to
have a bridge. Because of the multitude of possible combinations of
environments, bridges use an intermediary environment, namely the UNO
environment. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">If a new compiler is to be used or
software written in a new language, then one only needs to provide a
bridge into the UNO environment and all other environments for which
there is also a UNO bridge may interact with the new environment.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The CLI &ndash; UNO bridge enables

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The development of 3rd party

adding or removing packages. It may be desirable that users can
deploy packages while running an office process and trigger removal

tool is a command line tool.  If deployment can be performed while
running the office process, a proper user interface is nice, too
(e.g. in &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu bar).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The need to shut down the offices
using a shared installation is even worse, e.g. Imagine having a

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Noel Power, April 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently Scripting support for
SO/OOo exists for one language only, SO/OOo Basic. Users, Developers
and ISVs who wish to extend SO/OOo using scripting are locked into
this single offering. It is advantageous from strategic point of view
to support Java and Java derivatives  such as JavaScript and
BeanShell for scripting.  Other scripting languages such as Python
could also be added as the market dictates.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A framework is needed to allow new
scripting languages to be added and supported. It should be possible
to easily plug in additional languages runtimes. The framework needs
to provide an environment to enable users to easily and quickly
develop, deploy and execute scripts. Scripting should be easy.  A
script developer should be able to write and test a script with a
minimal set of steps. They should be able to experiment and learn
within the scripting environment, enabling them to accomplish their
scripting tasks easily and quickly.   
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Scripting in SO/OOo will be made more
easy, intuitive and low cost. This is mainly due to the complexity
and low level nature of the current SO/OOo API.  In order for
scripting to be be easy, intuitive and low cost, the SO/OOo API needs
to be simplified. Such a simplified API should be well documented,
script focused and high-level. This would allow users to intuitively
discover the necessary objects and interfaces needed to program a
specific task rather than having to work through a mountain of

&quot;Q&quot; is required to pickup the style of all basic widget

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&quot;Geordi&quot; uses a proprietary

consistent with the Desktop and the major applications. Naming of
fonts shipping with &quot;Geordi&quot; or older versions of SO/OOo
must not change. Explicit settings for font replacement must remain
intact as well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This will be addressed by using the

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.2.1 Deployment 
</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The installation paradigm changes
from being primarily single user oriented to being administrator
oriented. It is looking for large scale installations and
administrations. This issue will be addressed by conforming the
installation process to the respective systems installer services,
since these services already provide or enable an existing
installation tooling.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The &quot;Geordi&quot;
user-installation as a required step of a network-installation will
cease to exist. The office applications will be fully functional from

Document and setting defaults will be generated on the fly during the
first start or on demand.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The repair mode of the setup will be
dropped. Repairing the installed files is already handled by the
native package mechanism (usually by a reinstall). This does not
affect user driven changes since user and system files are strictly
separated.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Upgrading and patching will be
performed by means of the respective system installer.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Since Solaris and Linux do not

<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.2.2 SO/OOo Configuration 
</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Improvements for the handling of
configuration data are planned that effect the whole application.
These are additions to the existing configuration technology:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Reset of configuration settings
  within the Options Dialog</P>
  <P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently, it is not possible for a
  user to return to his initial settings provided during the
  installation process.  This gap will be addressed with the
  introduction of 'reset to default' functionality in the SO/OOo
  Options Dialog. A user is able to select a specific settings page
  within the options dialog and can press the reset button and the
  respective settings will be reset to their installation default.
  Quitting the dialog with the OK button will make the settings
  persistent.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Protection of configuration
  settings.</P>
  <P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Administrators have the possibility
  to protect configuration settings against changes by the user, so
  that the settings are effectively read-only. &quot;Geordi&quot;
  reflects the read-only status only for a few selected settings in
  the option dialog. Settings not addressed could still be overwritten
  by the user and applied for the lifetime of the SO/OOo session. For
  the &quot;Q&quot; release this gap is closed and all read-only
  settings are reflected as such in the Options dialog.</P>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Notification handling</P>
  <P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Changes of configuration settings
  are currently very seldom reflected to the user. Only a few
  components within SO/OOo are able to listen and apply notifications
  of configuration settings. In some specific deployment scenarios,
  like SunRay deployments, it is very common that applications are
  long running.</P>
  <P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Therefore it is important that
  SO/OOo is able to react and apply configuration changes, when they
  occur instead of requiring a restart. &quot;Q&quot; addresses the
  misbehavior by introducing a consistent configuration notification
  handling.</P>

4.2.3 Modern Look &amp; Feel</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Christian Jansen, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Since we have started to improve the
look and feel in &quot;Geordi&quot;, we will continue this work with
&quot;Q&quot;. This chapter gives an overview of what will be done to
get a more up-to-date user interface which provides more satisfaction
to work with.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.3.1 Toolbars</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The look and feel of toolbars will be
improved by introducing a completely renewed technology for toolbar
handling. They will get a modern, intuitive look and will be improved
for usability.  For example, the handling of dragging a toolbar will
be improved by adding an area which indicates that it is possible to
drag a toolbar. Toolbars will also be improved by adding more
feedback during drag and drop interactions. This means for example
that toolbars will be &ldquo;magnetic,&rdquo; so that they jump
automatically to their correct position.  Another important feature
is that toolbars in &quot;Q&quot; will not use the whole application
width anymore when they are docked. From the visual appearance
toolbars will get a more flattened look.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.3.2 Widget style</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Another very important area to
improve is to renew the look of widgets (widgets in graphical user
interfaces, are a combination of a graphic symbol and some program
code to perform a specific function.  E.g. a scroll-bar or button.)
Depending on the level of system integration, SO/OOo will use the
widget style of the Desktop. If this is not possible for &quot;Q&quot;
the current widget style will be improved in a way that SO/OOo looks
attractive enough in environments like Gnome 2.x /3.x or Microsoft
Windows Longhorn (the successor of Microsoft Windows XP).</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.3.3 Tool Pane</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">With SO/OOo &quot;Q&quot; a &ldquo;new&rdquo;
type of dialog will be introduced. We call this dialog Tool Pane,
since it is related to tool windows, e.g. the Stylist.  It works like
modeless dialogs do. The Tool Pane by default will be vertically
docked and positioned to the left or the right of the document. Tool
Panes will be introduced in SO/OOo Impress first, because SO/OOo
Impress is an application where turning to more modeless user
interface makes most sense.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Tool Panes can contain for example a
list of predefined presentation layouts which can easily be applied
to the presentation by dragging a thumbnail of a layout onto the
slide. To give the Tool Panes a modern look they will come in a 
web-like style. Tool Panes will have less complex layouts than
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; dialogs, this assures a much easier handling
and saves time when creating a presentation.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.3.4 Dialog Design In General</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo &quot;Q&quot; dialogs will be
improved in the following areas:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Disabled items will not have a
  3D style, a disabled state will only be grayed out.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Tool Windows, like the color
  palette, will be modernized by removing the old fashioned
  3D-borders.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Selections, like they are  for
  example displayed in the Gallery, will be replaced by a more
  state-of-the-art look.</P>
</UL>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.3.5 AutoPilots (Wizards)</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently, many AutoPilots in
&quot;Geordi&quot; are designed differently from each other. Some of
them are more than five years old and never changed in their
appearance. For SO/OOo &quot;Q&quot; the look of the AutoPilots will
be unified to a design which is orientated towards a typical Wizard
design used by Mozilla or other applications like an Installer.
Having a consistent look over all AutoPilots within SO/OOo improves
usability and provides a higher overall satisfaction because users
will come faster to a result. The renewed AutoPilots will also come
with a minimum of technical expressions, users will be assisted
through the steps by adding short notes or explanations into the
dialog.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.3.6 System Integration</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Being a good citizen in a desktop
environment is a very important topic. The SO/OOo system integration
will be improved for Gnome based Desktops. System integration for the
look and feel means that typical desktop behaviors or looks have to
be also used in SO/OOo e.g., the mouse pointer has to look in SO/OOo
the same as on the desktop.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A good system integration includes
also a set of document and application icons which fit the style of
the desktop, on that SO/OOo runs. For &quot;Q&quot; we will have icon
sets, that will take care of the typical style of the desktop
environments.</P>

4.2.4 Integration (Plug-ins, 3rd party applications)</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Mathias Bauer, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The main subject of this chapter is
about linking and embedding data in or from SO/OOo. To better
understand this, here is a short description of the current
functionality and the history of its development.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In the past SO/OOo was made up by
single applications that supported the OLE compound document
architecture and so were able to embed and link objects from other
applications that also support this architecture. The same technology
was used to embed objects from the different SO/OOo applications into
each other.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The biggest drawback of this approach
was that it worked only on Microsoft Windows.  SO/OOo versions on
other platforms were only able to display a cached representation of
the embedded object (usually a GDI metafile).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When SO/OOo was redesigned to follow
a platform independent approach for its GUI, the support for OLE was
removed with the exception of the ability to embed 3rd party objects
into SO/OOo and activate them in an external window on Microsoft
Windows (so called &ldquo;Outplace activation&rdquo;). The more
advanced &ldquo;Inplace activation&rdquo; of 3rd party objects
(editing embedded objects in an own window inside the embedding
container document) was abandoned and also the ability to embed
SO/OOo objects into 3rd party applications was completely removed.
Another dropped feature was the ability to link to external files
instead of embedding them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The internal embedding functionality
(embedding SO/OOo documents into each other) still used the old code
formerly written to wrap the OLE interfaces, but most of the OLE
related parts of the implementation were removed. Because we didn't
have any replacement for OLE, all SO/OOo modules had to be put into
one single application, otherwise we would lose the ability to
activate SO/OOo &ldquo;Inplace&rdquo; even in our own applications.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Meanwhile, customers responded with
several suggestions for improvement.  These suggestions included the
following: 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Inplace Activation is seen as
  indispensable functionality of modern applications on Microsoft
  Windows.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The inability to embed SO/OOo
  objects into other applications is a strong competitive disadvantage
  against the competing applications if the customer uses such
  application techniques in his own IT solutions.</P>
</UL>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.4.1 Support for OLE</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The following concept will show how
SO/OOo can get the needed functionality and how we can develop this
in a multi step procedure.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo can embed its own formats on
all platforms and also OLE objects from other applications on
Microsoft Windows. &quot;Geordi&quot; adds the new feature that
SO/OOo objects can be embedded via OLE into other applications'
documents on Microsoft Windows. In this case and also in the case of
3rd party objects embedded in SO, activation of the object is only
possible &ldquo;Outplace&rdquo;, no &ldquo;Inplace&rdquo; activation
is possible. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&ldquo;Q&rdquo; will allow &ldquo;Inplace&rdquo;
activation in both cases and also add the currently missing feature
of linked objects.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Besides that the whole embedding
functionality and API (currently C++, in future UNO based) will be
redesigned to support arbitrary embedding techniques, objects and
persistence models. The switch to an API solution will also
drastically improve the maintainability, stability and extendibility
of the code.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Some examples for features that will
be enabled by these changes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">It might be possible to add
  support for comparable embedding and activation procedures from
  other platforms like Bonobo on Gnome (if there is a demand for
  that). This can be done without changing any existing code, only
  some new services have to be implemented that use the same
  interfaces as the services that are used to support OLE. Because the
  OLE and Bonobo interfaces are quite similar, this seems to be a
  reachable goal for later steps.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Embedding, persistence and
  activation will be treated as orthogonal functionality, that means
  embedded objects are not forced to support persistence or
  activation. So we can have embedded and activatable objects without
  own persistence data (&ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; objects) like
  embedded charts that get their data from an embedding container.
  This is a feature that makes our own charts more usable and more
  comparable to state-of-the-art solutions.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The enhanced embedding capabilities
also improve the interoperability of Microsoft Office with StarOffice
on the file level.  In StarOffice 6.0 embedded SO/OOo objects in
exported Microsoft Office documents are stored in Microsoft Office
file format or in our old binary format. The first alternative has
the drawback that the object must be exported and imported back when
loaded again and this export/import cycle may cause some data loss. 
The latter alternative has the drawback that there is no way to
activate the embedded object in the document if it is loaded into the
Microsoft Office application, and of course the old binary format is
also at risk to cause data loss, <SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT SIZE=3>e.g.</FONT></SPAN>
we will lose all CJK attributes). 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Since &quot;Geordi&quot; those
objects can be stored as full featured OLE objects using our XML file
format, with full support for activation in a Microsoft Office
container without any possible data loss. &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will add
the Inplace Activation of these objects in the Microsoft Office
container and so enhance the user experience and interoperability.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.4.2 Browser Integration</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A first implementation of a
Mozilla/Netscape plug-in for Windows already exists, along with
ActiveX control for Microsoft  Internet Explorer, and a signed Java
applet. All these objects when embedded into a browser use a local
SO/OOo installation to view SO/OOo documents inside a browser.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In &ldquo;Q&rdquo; the plug-in will
be completed and extended to other platforms. All objects will get
some enhancements and optimizations, because even the ActiveX control
and the Java applet suffer from some usability problems.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will enable editing functionality
for documents loaded by the embedded browser objects.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.4.3 Integration of 3rd party UNO
components</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In &quot;Geordi&quot; we developed
the very powerful Addon concept that already enables customers to use
our ODK to develop components that can be easily integrated into
SO/OOo and the SO/OOo GUI. Especially the GUI integration will be
enhanced in &ldquo;Q&rdquo; together with the changes in the
application framework GUI code.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.4.4 Integration with mail
clients</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Will be determined later.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.4.5 Integration of media files
into SO/OOo</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Currently SO/OOo can only use browser
plug-ins to play videos in <SPAN LANG="en-US"><FONT SIZE=3>e.g.</FONT></SPAN>
a presentation, and unfortunately these plugins do not work in SO/OOo
on Linux or Solaris. So a different and more powerful way to work
with media files is needed. Possibly this can be combined with the
new embedding API mentioned in the section about OLE.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.2.4.6 Support for filter
development</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo already has a concept for the
development of filter components. In the past very often the
necessary configuration files for filters caused some problems, so
the filter configuration will be changed for a better manageability.
Additionally all internal filters will be converted to real filter
components to make it easy to replace them.</P>

aims more on a sophistication and refinement of existing features.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">This applies to all applications such

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Text Grid</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For Asian users the text grid is a
valuable help to learn writing in school as well as a traditional way
of writing in good manner and style.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo text grid abilities will be
enhanced by more versatile printing options, more default templates
to choose from and additional adjustments that can be applied on the
behavior of Western text within text grid.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Doing so will put SO/OOo in line or
ahead of our competitors and enhancing our text grid it is a valuable
issue gathering more acceptance of traditional users.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Enhanced IME Support</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The IME is the most crucial
instrument for all East-Asian users. It enables them to input their
characters. While Sun Solaris provide standard IMEs, the Linux
community provides various ones.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Customers have requested that SO/OOo
support as many IMEs as possible. It will help SO/OOo to consolidate
its position within the Asian Linux world as it is already leading in
the Western world.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Furthermore we will have a more
sophisticated read-out of IMEs. Since the IMEs that come with
Microsoft Windows are all using an extensive unified interface
(contrary to Linux for example) users are used to certain amenities,
such as automatic language detection while typing. Unfortunately the
variety of different IMEs throughout Microsoft Windows, Sun Solaris
and Linux brought us to choose the smallest common denominator. This
will change.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Numbering and Bullets</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In Arabic and Hebrew regions people
write right-to-left (RTL). Therefore also they use numberings and
bullets on the right side with right alignment.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Since &ldquo;Geordi&rdquo; takes care
of basic features of aligning bullets, &quot;Q&quot; will give more
intelligent automatism like in well-known products on these markets.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Also a bigger variety on localized

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Special Formatting</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Like East-Asians also CTL users are
accustomed to various ways of formatting their text. These are mostly
minor issues but having them will give SO/OOo a more complete and
respectable estimate. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Also addressing certain features not
only to CTL users in general but to address them to the specific user
group (like Arabic) will enhance it even more.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><BR><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">RTL-UI</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">While a lot of Arabic and Hebrew
people are used to work in an English left-to-right (LTR) environment
to accomplish their (RTL) work, they highly value if a product is
also available in their local (RTL) flavor. Even if a RTL-UI is not
perfect and the users might switch back to an English LTR-UI the
RTL-UI can often be considered the &ldquo;door-opener&rdquo; to these
people.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">&ldquo;Geordi&rdquo; already provides
a framework for RTL-UI. Early adopters such as Tk Open Systems in
Israel have brought up first promising prototypes. &quot;Q&quot; will

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Documentation and UI Style</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Most users in East Asia and in CTL

SO/OOo will use this to ease transfer and learning for  the users. It
will also familiarize them quicker with our product.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Special attention has to be given on
possible cultural issues and clashes with UI terms as well as with
the localized documentation (see the PR China - Taiwan example in the

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Every country has its own special
cases and rules. And not all can be addressed by a single product
such as SO/OOo. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">But when launching in those markets a
build-in support for the most important tools and their vendors is
advisable. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Examples:</P>
<UL>

  countries like India (7 major languages and scripts) are used to use
  on-screen keyboards to visualize the various keyboard layouts.</P>

common:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">They all have local vendors that
create, program and sell value-added software for office productivity
suites.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Supporting these tools and/or giving
developers of such companies documentation at hand to provide tools
also for SO/OOo can raise the meter for acceptance considerably.

4.3.2 Digital Signatures</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Michael Brauer, May 2003)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">As said above, digital signatures
themselves are a relatively new topic for office applications, but
the requirement to protect data from being modified has always
existed.  In SO/OOo, like in other office suites, it has been
addressed by documents and document pieces that could be protected
from being edited, like text sections in Writer or tables in Calc. 
Sometimes the protection is a simple option.  Sometimes the
protection is combined with a password.  In both cases, these
features are nothing more than an edit protection built into SO/OOo.
They do not add any real security to a document, because they cannot
protect documents from being changed outside SO/OOo. This in fact has
become much easier with the introduction of the XML file formats,
that even removed the little piece of security that the proprietary
and undocumented binary file formats had.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Though the existing protection
features don't offer security, they show where demand for and benefit
of digital signatures seems to be highest. Therefore, adding digital
signatures to SO/OOo in &ldquo;Q&rdquo; will start with adding
digital signatures to the existing protection features. This not only
makes these features secure, it also allows customers to use
signatures with very little learning effort. Most important however
is that customers this way get a solid set of digital signature
features that they can use in their environment and in their
workflows. To better support digital signature based workflows from
the beginning, multiple independent signatures will be supported for
one and the same document piece. Based on customer experience with
these features, support for hierarchical signatures or other kinds of
nested signatures might be added in later SO/OOo versions as well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">To actually save digital signatures
in SO/OOo files, W3C's XML Signature recommendation will be used. It
is not only a standard that very well fits into the strategy of
reusing existing standards for SO/OOo's file format, but it also can
be assumed that this standard will be supported widely in the near
future.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">SO/OOo's signature features for
documents will make use of the same security framework that is used
for other security features in SO/OOo, like for Basic macros. That is
to say, there will be one key management and a common set of
signature methods in SO/OOo.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In contrast to signatures, encryption
is a feature that has been supported by office applications for a
long time.  In &quot;Geordi&quot;, encryption is available for whole
documents.  Since there was no encryption standard available at the
time the XML file format was introduced, encryption currently is done
as a SO/OOo specific extension of the ZIP packages that contain the
XML files.  As soon as encryption based on the recently finished W3C
XML Encryption recommendation becomes more widespread, that may be
the case for &ldquo;Q&rdquo; or later, it will be supported by SO/OOo
as well. It again will make use of SO/OOo's common security framework
for key management and encryption methods. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Since the W3C Encryption
specification does not only support encryption of whole documents but
also of document parts, future SO/OOo versions might also support
encryption for document parts only, like this will be the case for
signatures in &ldquo;Q&rdquo; already.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">(Kai Sommerfeld, May 2003)</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.3.4.1 SO/OOo Web-Services Client
(WebServices-1)</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Basically, from the current state,
there are three approaches to cover Web Services partly or fully. The
different approaches are:</P>
<OL TYPE=A>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Access Web Services via Java
  mechanisms from Java.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Use an invocation based
  approach.</P>
  <LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Have a full featured UNO
  language binding</P>
</OL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A: As UNO components for SO/OOo can
already be written in Java, there is already the possibility to
access web services. The usage of web services via Java is limited to
Java and does not allow to export the Offices API as a web service.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">B: A diploma thesis has been written
to have more direct UNO support. With this UNO component, it is
possible to seamlessly access web services from Star Basic (please
see
http://udk.openoffice.org/java/examples/wsproxy/component_description.html
for more details). The implementation of this component is not yet
feature complete.  Most Web Services can be accessed, but some, that
use special features currently cannot be used. To use it for general
purpose, it is necessary to extend the component to support this
features.  Being a UNO service, this component can be in principal
used from any language supported by UNO, for instance SO/OOo Basic,
C++ or Java.  But access to web services is only for these languages
seamless, which support the XInvocation and the XPropertySet for
invoking methods respectively accessing properties. The only language
currently doing this is SO/OOo Basic.  For all other languages it is
kind of nasty and inconvenient. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">C: The most general and most
expensive approach to web services support in SO/OOo respectively UNO
is a web services language binding. This renders web services to be
fully UNO accessible and allows the export of UNO objects as web
services as well as the import of any web service. Web services are
then directly programmable in any UNO supported language, without any
additional burden.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.3.4.2 SO/OOo UDDI Browser
(WebServices-2)</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">There are several free UDDI browsers
available from 3rd parties. A good example is a web based browser at
http://www.soapclient.com/uddisearch.html. This browser includes a
generic SOAP client, which supports even live testing of Web
Services. UDDI browsers can be used to obtain the URL of the WSDL
file for certain  Web Services. The WSDL file can then be used to
create a UNO component instance representing the Web Service, like
described above. There seems to be no real need for a SO/OOo UDDI
Browser, because the actual value-add is very small. The
implementation effort would be medium to high.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Another approach would be the
integration of Web Services into the coming Scripting Framework. Web
Services could then seamlessly be offered via the macro selection
dialog. Further investigation is needed, to clarify details.</P>
<H4 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">4.3.4.3 SO/OOo Web Services Provider
(not covered by requirements so far)</H4>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Web Services use SOAP for remote
method invocation. A UNO-SOAP language binding could be implemented
to offer every SO/OOo functionality that is available as a UNO
service as a Web Service. See also &ldquo;SO/OOo Web-Services
Client&rdquo;.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The effort to implement a  UNO-SOAP
language binding is very high (raw estimation: at least 3 months).</P>

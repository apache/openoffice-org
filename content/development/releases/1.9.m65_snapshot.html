<h1>1.9 m65 Snapshot <br>
</h1>
<h2>Release Notes</h2>
these notes contains changes between 680_m63 and&nbsp; 680_m65.<br>
this release will install as OpenOffice.org 1.9.65, it comes with ugly
hacked splash screen to make clear, that this is not the final 2.0
build.<br>
Sources can be received from cvs by tag SRC680_m65.<br>
<br>
<h2>Important Notes <br>
</h2>
<h3>File Format</h3>
Some documents that have been saved with SRC680 build prior to m64
cannot be loaded into SRC680m64 and future builds. This espacially
applies to Writer documents. To be able to load them, the file need to
be coverted. The conversion can be done as follows:<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;Create a backup of the document.</li>
  <li>Rename the document to a file with the same name but an
extensions that has the 2nd "o" replaced with a "d". For instance,
test.oot becomes test.odt. For drawing documents, use the extension
"odg". For templates,only the extension of drawing templates has to be
changed to "otg".</li>
  <li>Unzip the sub documents "mimetype" and "META-INF/manifest.xml"
from the document using an arbitrary zip tool.</li>
  <li>Within the unzipped "mimetype" and "META-INF/manifest.xml" files,
replace all occurencies of "x-vnd.oasis.openoffice" with
"vnd.oasis.opendocument".</li>
  <li>Add the "mimetype" file uncompressed to the document.</li>
  <li>Add "META-INF/manifest.xml" to the document.</li>
  <li>Load the document into OpenOffice.org and resave it.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
For a file called test.oot, on Unix/Solaris the following commands do
that job:<br>
<br>
<blockquote type="cite">
  <pre wrap=""><span class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>cp test.oot test.odt<br><span
 class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>unzip test.odt mimetype META-INF/manifest.xml<br><span
 class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>mv mimetype mimetype.bak<br><span
 class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>sed -e"s/x-vnd\.oasis\.openoffice/vnd.oasis.opendocument/"<br></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre wrap=""><!---->    mimetype.bak &gt;mimetype<br></pre>

</blockquote>

 class="moz-txt-citetags">&gt; </span>[start OpenOffice.org, load file and dave it again]<br></pre>
</blockquote>
<br>
Background: The OASIS Open Office Technical Committee (TC) recently
decided to rename its specification from "Open Office Specification
1.0" to "OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications
(OpenDocument) 1.0", abbreviated "OpenDocument". At the same time the
TC decided to use new extensions (odt, ods, etc. instead oot, oos,
etc.), new MIME types (application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text, etc.
instead of application/vnd.oasis.openoffice.text, etc) and new XML
namespace URIs.<br>
This change has been implemented in SRC680m64.<br>
Elizabeth explained the proper naming in
her <a href="http://l10n.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=4425">message</a> to the dev@l10n list.

      <td>Hangul Hanja feature changed </td>

      <td>In Korean apart from Hangul (Korean alphabet) Hanja (Chinese
characters) is often used for writing. Since all Hanja words have a
transliteration in Hangul Koreans often first write a word in Hangul
and convert it then to Hanja.
MS Word and Hancom 97/2002 provide special functionality to address
this issue. To stay competitive on the Korean market OpenOffice.org 1.1
will need to have such feature, too.
<!--
(According to SunONE Korea this feature is regarded as a show stopper
in case of not-having it!)
All of this spec has 1.1 Beta as a goal, apart from the sections that
are marked &#8220;Goal '2.0'&#8221;.

      <td>feature-info:<br>
As a small convenience improvement when designing form documents (and
as welcome side effect of another implementation in CWS eforms2), the
content of the form property browser now follows the user action.
That is: Previously, if you displayed properties of a form in the
property browser, and then selected a control in your document, the
property browser switched to the form which this control belonged to.
Effectively, this means the property browser content usually didn't
change, which was confusing.
Nowadays, whenever you select a form control in the document view, or
a control or form in the form navigator (or, in both cases: more than
one), the property browser will follow this selection, and display the
properties of the selected object(s). </td>

In the CWS presentationengine01, the Impress slideshow subsystem is

PPT effects.
On the UI, the new functionality is mainly reflected by two new task
panels, namely one for shape effect and one for slide
transitions. Overall, the workflow and controllability regarding
animation effects should be much improved. </td>

      </a></td>
      <td>feature-info:<br>
Currently, check box and option button form controls can be bound to
cells in spreadsheet documents, but are only able to exchange boolean
values with those cells.
That is, when the control is selected resp. checked, TRUE appears in
the cell, and when it's not selected resp. unchecked, FALSE appears.
The "indetermined" state is mapped to #N/A.
With the integration of eforms2, both control types are also able to
exchange strings with their bound cell.
That is, if the "Reference value" of the control is set to an
non-empty string, this string will be used for data exchange with the
cell:
If the control is selected resp. checked, the ref value appears in the
cell, and when it's not selected resp. unchecked, an empty string
appears. The "indetermined" state is still mapped to #N/A.
In the opposite direction, when you enter something in the bound cell,
the respective control will be selected / checked if and only if the
cell content evaluates to the reference value.
This allows new use cases: For instance, you could create a group of 3
option buttons, all bound to the same cell, but having different
reference values: Here, the cell will always contain exactly the
reference value of the selected option button.

specification at

Lotus 1-2-3 file without selecting a filter type now loads the file
into Calc instead of Writer. The feature set supported is similar to
the old *.wk? versions, with the addition of text attributes.
The following have been completed:
Rendering of Positive integers Rendering of Negative integers and
Character Data Rendering of Floating Point Numbers
Rendering of Numbers that are multiples of 10
Rendering of Long Numbers stored in IEEE Format

Xalan-J 2.6.0, together with the embedded Xerces-J 2.6.2 version, has
been added to the build environment.
A new module 'xalan' has been created containing the three mandatory
JARs 'xalan.jar', 'xercesImpl.jar' and 'xml-apis.jar'.
All three JARs will be delivered into the
'<office_path>/program/classes' directory. Office components, which
want to use it, should load the JARs by their
manifest.
For example, the line 'Class-Path: xalan.jar xercesImp.jar
xml-apis.jar' has been added to the manifest 'MANIFEST.MF' of the
XSLTFilter.jar. By this all XSLT filter of the Office uses Xalan2.6
now.
Exception: JDK/JRE1.4 users will still use the integrated Xalan.
All changes are integrated with the CWS xsltfilter04 and will be most
probably available with the src680_m63 build. </office_path></td>

in the table's properties. This new feature improves the Microsoft
interoperability and is also set as default for new created Writer
documents to improve the export to Microsoft Word format. But this new
feature has some side effects for new created documents: Writer
automatically assigns paragraph styles "Table heading" and "Table
content" to a table's heading and content. Due to paragraph spacing,
set in those styles, the spacing between the last paragraph at the end
of a cell and the table border is now much bigger than in OO 1.1.
Especially single line paragraph content will not be shown vertically

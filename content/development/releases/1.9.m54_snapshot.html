When executing a query, the preview window appears which displays the
result of the query. The only possible way to close the preview again
was a toolbox button "Close Window". This toolbox entry will be
deleted. Therefore the "View" menu will contain an additional entry
called "Preview". When the user toggles this menu entry, the same
execution will happen as if the user presses the "Exceute Query"
toolbar button.
- Toolbar button "Close Window"
+ Menu entry "View" -&gt; "Preview"

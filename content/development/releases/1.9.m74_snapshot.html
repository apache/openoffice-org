      <td>feature-info:<br>
Upon request of the documentation team, the "Default Filter" feature
in the data source browser has been renamed to "Standard Filter". That
is, the tooltip of the respective icon changed, and the title of the
dialog opened upon clicking this toolbar icon changed, too.
With this, the naming now is consistent with the very similar feature
in Calc.
This change affects en-US only, no other locales. </td>

      <td>feature-info:<br>
The character set restriction previously imposed on dBase databases
has been relaxed: Previously, it was not possible to use an encoding
where different characters are to be encoded to different by counts.
For instance, in UTF-8 encoding, a single Unicode character might be
encoded as one, two, or even more bytes.
With CWS dba22ui, all such encodings, and UTF-8 in particular, are
allowed (as long as the restrictions from
http://dba.openoffice.org/specifications/character_sets.html still
apply).
When using such an encoding, be aware that the "field length" of dBase
table columns becomes a somewhat fuzzy meaning: According to the dBase
file format, the field length denotes the number of bytes reserved for
data in this field. In the OOo user interface, people tend to assume
that the field length means the maximum number of characters which can
be written into the field. This is not true for the UTF-8 encoding
anymore.
As a consequence, when the user enters a string which has less
characters than specified in the field length, but is encoded to more
bytes than the field length, an error message is shown to the user,
explaining the situation. </td>

In database forms, date and time fields 'til recently had the habit to

is, when you had such a field in your form, and wanted to enter a new
record, then the fields were pre-filled with the current date
respectively time.
This behaviour, which is almost never desired, has been changed - the
fields are not pre-filled anymore. </td>

With the implementation of the "queries in queries" feature, it is no
possible to add both tables and queries to other queries. In the
graphical query designer, this means that now, it was not possible to
recognize whether a given existent object denoted a query or table.
To visualize the difference, the windows which represent a table resp.
query now show the proper object icon (table or query) in the upper
left corner.
Additionally, linked text tables in HSQLDB, which since a while ago
have a dedicated icon, are also represented with this icon.
Furthermore, the same applies to the relation designer (which cannot
include queries, but tables and linked tables). </td>

In the advanced database settings (menu: Edit / Database / Advanced

called "Use keyword AS before table alias names".
This option is enabled if and only if "Append the table alias name on
SELECT statements" option is checked, and itself checked by default
for newly created databases.
When checked, SQL statements generated by Base will use the AS keyword
as follows: SELECT * FROM "table" AS "table"
When not checked, the above statement would look like SELECT * FROM
"table" "table"
The first option is more human readable, the second option is required
by some databases (Oracle ODBC, in particular). </td>

      <td>feature-info:<br>
When a document is loaded in the OOo GUI a view is created at the end
of the loading process. Until now OpenOffice.org always grabbed the
focus to the window of this view. This is very annoying when a large
document was loaded and the user sent OOo to the background as he
wants to do something else while the document is loading. At the end of
the loading process the document suddenly was brought to
front and disturbed the user in what he was doing at this time (on
WinXP it might flicker in the taskbar only when the focus meanwhile
was transferred to a different application). Now OOo will bring the
window to front (or starts flickering the
window in the task bar) only when a modal dialog was opened in the OOo
document window as part of the loading process (e.g. a dialog asking
for granting execution of macros). The window could have been left in
the background even in this case.
But as modal dialogs could prevent OOo from opening other documents
until they are closed, users might get confused if they didn't notice
that their first document is still blocked by a dialog waiting for
being closed by the user.
As part of the fix for this annoying user interface bug it was was
also fixed that dialogs opened in the loading time sometimes had the
wrong parent window what especially created problems in the GUI test
tool.
As this bug fix has an impact on the visual experience of OOo I found
it's appropriate to send out this notification thought it's neither an
enhancement nor a feature change. </td>

Originally, it was planned to introduce actual extension dependencies
(see <http:>)
on a by-need basis. No needs for extensions depending on features
introduced in
OOo 2.1 have been claimed. However, kso raised concern for the
following
scenario: after OOo 2.1 has been released, someone writes an extension
that does
depend on features introduced in OOo 2.1. That extension cannot
declare its
dependencies adequately, unless we do introduce a dependency <openoffice.org-minimal-version
 value="2.1"> now. (Which has the
consequence
that people will assume that for future versions similar dependencies
with
value="2.2" etc. will also be available.)
Formally, the dependency is an empty XML element whose name consists
of the
namespace name "http://openoffice.org/extensions/description/2006" and
the local
part "OpenOffice.org-minimal-version". It shall have two attributes,
namely the
"name" attribute required for every dependency and an attribute with
unprefixed
name "value" whose value is the string representation of an OOo
version starting
with OOo 2.1 (in which case the value is the string "2.1"). The
dependency is
fulfilled if and only if the value of the current OOo version is
(element-by-element lexicographically) greater than or equal to the
specified value. </openoffice.org-minimal-version></http:></td>

acceptance of the software. Therefore the OpenOffice.org (OOo) Dialog
IDE will be extended to handle translation of GUIs build with the
internal dialog IDE. New languages for a dialog can be created and
switched on the fly by using the new Translation toolbar. </td>

When working in an English language locale, AutoFill now recognizes an

results in cells 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ... If the original cell was an
"edit cell" (formatted with in-cell attributes), for example because
the AutoCorrection option "Replace 1st... with 1^st..." was enabled
when entering "1st", the ordinal suffix will have the superscript
attribute. </td>

 class="SmallText1">osl[in|de]crementInterlockedCount(): don't use "lock" prefix on single processor, single core, non HT machines<br><br>The sal functions osl[in|de]crementInterlockedCount() use atomic operations to<br>increment and decrement a counter. On all x86 platforms this is done with a<br>"lock xadd" prefix. "Lock" means here to lock the bus, a quite expensive<br>operation on pre HyperThreading Intel processors and quite uncessary if there is<br>only one non HT, single core processor in the system (xadd with prefix is around<br>8 times slower on some processors than without prefix). The new implementation checks if we are on<br>a single processor single core non HT machine and leaves the "lock" prefix out<br>in this case.<br><br>Some benchmarks:<br><br>1) Just excercising os[in|de]crementInterlockedCount 100.000.000 times each. <br>Times are in seconds user time (Unix) resp. wall clock time (Windows).<br><br>Platform: Processor: hr39: m182:<br>Solaris x86 2x3.06 GHz Xeon 13.26 13.23<br>Solaris x86 1x800 Mhz AMD 10.44 13.95 !<br>Solaris x86 2.2 Ghz Opteron 3.66 3.93<br>Solaris x86 1.8 Ghz Pentium IV 3.76 23.61 !<br><br>Linux x86 2x3.06 GHz Xeon 13.14 13.09<br>Linux x86 1.8 Ghz Pentium IV 4.47 24.81 !<br><br>Windows 2x3.06 GHz Xeon 13.86 13.83<br>Windows 1.8 Ghz Pentium IV 3.43 23.83 !<br><br>2) Starting soffice, loading the spreadsheet "numbers_large.ods"<br>(which is kinda pathologic in its loading behavior), closing<br>the office.

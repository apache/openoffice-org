<h1>1.9 m49 Snapshot <br>
</h1>
<h2>Release Notes</h2>
these notes contains changes between 680_m47 and&nbsp; 680_m49.<br>
this release will install as OpenOffice.org 1.9.m49, it comes with ugly
hacked splash screen to make clear, that this is an interims build
between 1.1 and 2.0.<br>
for snapshot builds there will be no extra source tar balls created,
sources can be received from cvs by tag SRC680_m49.<br>
<br>
This version includes several new features that need to be mentioned:
<br>
<br>
OASIS Open Office file format as default file format
<br>
(Attention: The newly integrated OASIS Open Office file format
implementation within OpenOffice.org will change within the next minor
versions and saving files within this format won't be reliable within
this version. On the other hand it would be helpful if some users will
have a look at this format)
<br>
<br>
Increased row limit to 65k rows in Calc
<br>
This feature should work and it should be tested extensively
<br>
<br>
File locking enabled by default on UNIX/Linux platforms
<br>
If problems occur with this change it would be good to know about
<br>
<br>
New toolbar concept and design
<br>
As far as I know there are several changes which haven't done it into
this version. It would be very helpful to get feedback about usability
problems regarding this feature
<br>
<br>
Automatic Java Configuration, Java Options Panel
<br>
OpenOffice.org should find a Java version by itself and it can be
configured in /tools/options/java
<br>
<br>
Some known problems are left:
<br>
<br>
There are several known bugs which might restrict users from using the
application as it should be.
<br>
<br>
issue 31854&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "presentation shows multipane view in
presentation mode"
<br>
issue 31402&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "presentations first slide is painted
black"
<br>
???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Crash when exiting the application if Draw or Impress
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
have been used before.
<br>
<br>
These bugs were introduced by the implementation of the new multipane
view within Impress and they will restrict the use of doing
presentations.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Native Installer</h3>
OpenOffice.org 1.9.49 is now available with native installer. This
includes the Windows Installer for the Windows platform, RPMs for Linux
and Packages for Solaris Sparc and Solaris x86. These installation sets
were built in the cvs project "instsetoo_native", which will substitute
the current "instsetoo" in the near future.
<br>
<h4>Windows: </h4>
Change into the directory where you unzipped the download file. There
you find the complete installation set. Please use the setup.exe in the
root of the installation set to start the installation process and
follow the instructions in the installation wizard. To deinstall the
product again, you have to use the "Add or Remove Software" applet in
the Control Panel. That's all.
For 1.9.49 this version will only install on Box where the .Net
Framework has been installed before, this will be fixed with 1.9.50.<br>
<h4>Solaris:
</h4>
<br>
For Solaris you download a file tar.gz. You can unpack this file with
"gunzip" and "tar -xvf". After this unpacking you find a Solaris
package, that can be installed using pkgadd. The normal way to install
a package requires root privileges. You can use the commands:
<br>
<br>
pkgadd -a adminfile.txt -d .
OOOopenoffice-core&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (relocatable with the
optional admin file (parameter -a)&nbsp; in which
"basedir=/opt/myBaseDir" has to be defined)
<br>
<br>
For the deinstallation the corresponding command is
<br>
<br>
pkgrm OOOopenoffice-core
<br>
<br>
Attention: The maximum length for names of Solaris packages on Solaris
8 and Solaris 9 is 9 characters. To extend this to 25 characters the
Solaris system has to contain the following patches:
<br>
<br>
The longer packages names we introduce by Bug 4025718.
<br>
If your building packages on S8 you need patches: 110934-12 (sparc)
&amp; 110935-12 (x86)
<br>
If your building packages on S9 you need patches: 113713-03 (sparc)
&amp; 114568-02 (x86)
<br>
<br>
The following packages are available
<br>
<br>
OOOopenoffice-core, the base package that must be installed. This is
required by all other packages
<br>
OOOopenoffice-writer, the writer application
<br>
OOOopenoffice-calc, the calc application
<br>
OOOopenoffice-draw, the draw application
<br>
OOOopenoffice-impress, the impress application
<br>
OOOopenoffice-math, the math application
<br>
OOOopenoffice-graphicfilter
<br>
OOOopenoffice-javafilter
<br>
OOOopenoffice-spellcheck
<br>
OOOopenoffice-testtool
<br>
OOOopenoffice-xsltfilter
<br>
OOOopenoffice-mailcap
<br>
OOOopenoffice-gnome, gnome system integration
<br>
OOOopenoffice-cde, cde sytem integration
<br>
<h4>Linux:
</h4>
For Linux you download a rpm file, that can be directly installed using
the rpm command. The normal way to install a rpm or a package requires
root privileges. You can use the commands:
<br>
<br>
rpm -i openoffice-core-1.9.49-1.i586.rpm
--prefix=/opt/myBaseDir&nbsp;&nbsp; (relocatable with the optional
parameter --prefix)
<br>
<br>
For the deinstallation the corresponding command is
<br>
<br>
rpm -e openoffice-core-1.9.49
<br>
<br>
The following RPMs are available
<br>
<br>
openoffice-core-1.9.49-1.i586.rpm , the base package that must be
installed. This is required by all other packages
<br>
openoffice-writer-1.9.49-1.i586.rpm
<br>

The OASIS Open Office XML File Format has been development and
standardized by the OASIS Open Office XML Format Technical Committee
(TC). Support of the OASIS Open Office XML Format has also been
announced by Koffice.
New extensions are used to be able to divide the new from the old
format and to prevent loading file with new format in an earlier
released OOo 1.1. The new file names are the same regardless of the
product vendor. So OOo and SO files are called the same. </td>

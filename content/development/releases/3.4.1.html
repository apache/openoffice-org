<p>Additionally, starting with version 3.4.1, Apache OpenOffice now has the benefit of static
analysis provided by <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> to detect software defects
before the code is even released. Special thanks to Coverity for providing access to their award
winning tool!</p>

<h2 id="AOO3.4.1ReleaseNotes-PerformanceImprovements%2FEnhancements">
Performance Improvements/Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cleanup of temporary areas used by extensions installations. This will reduce the
  per-user disk footprint for multi-user installations.</li>
  <li>Keeping only one English dictionary for US-en installations instead of 5. This will save
  user space. Users will be able to add other English dictionaries (Canadian, Australian,
  New Zealand) as desired</li>
  <li>Hunspell library upgraded to version 1.3.2 from 1.2.9. This version contains several
  improvements especially for Dutch, German and other Germanic languages with extended compound
  word usage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="AOO3.4.1ReleaseNotes-MicrosoftWindows8Compatibility">Microsoft Windows 8 Compatibility</h2>

<p>With this release we have tested with Windows 8. So far it looks good. We are in
the process of going through the official Windows 8 Certification checklist and some minor
issues still remain. See the wiki document below.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Windows_App_Certification_Kit_-_Test_Results_for_Apache_OpenOffice_3.4">
http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/Windows_App_Certification_Kit_-_Test_Results_for_Apache_OpenOffice_3.4</a></p>

<p>Note: the improvements made in Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 to better support Windows 8 will also
benefit Windows 7 users.</p>

<h2 id="AOO3.4.1ReleaseNotes-KnownIssues">Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 manage the user profile differently than previous
  versions. The old user profile is automatically converted so that users can keep their
  extensions and settings. In a minority of cases, especially with highly customized profiles
  (many extensions or customizations) the conversion doesn't succeed. Common symptoms are:
  frequent application crashes, problems with dictionaries or thesaurus, OpenOffice starting
  and crashing after a few seconds. To solve this, just reset/rename your user profile as
  explained in the official OpenOffice forum.

  http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12426</a></li>
  <li>Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 will be flagged by the new Gatekeeper facility in OS X
  Mountain Lion. This is a new feature to help guard against malware on Mac systems. There is
  a procedure laid out at the following link to allow applications not installed from the Mac
  App store to run. See the article at Mac support at
  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290</a>.</li>
  <li>Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0 and 3.4.1 support Java 7, which is the recommended configuration;
  but (especially on 64-bit Windows) you might receive warnings about the Java version being
  defective. In that case, download and install the
  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/B/C/5BC5DBB3-652D-4DCE-B14A-475AB85EEF6E/vcredist_x86.exe">
  Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package</a>. If you still have problems, install
  <a href="http://www.java.com/java6download/">the most current JRE 6 version</a>. Make sure
  you get the file "Windows x86 Offline (32-bit)". Then configure OpenOffice to use it at
  "Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - Java". See
  <a href="http://user.services.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=54974">
  this forum topic</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>The Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 installation package for Windows will expand the installation
  files and immediately start the installation wizard. In rare circumstances, probably because
  of incompatibilities with other installed software, the installation wizard might not start
  automatically. In that case, just locate the "OpenOffice Installation Files" folder on your
  Desktop, open it and double-click on the file named "setup.exe" to start the installation
  procedure.</li>
  <li>On recent versions of Mac OS X it might happen, especially after a "Force quit", that
  the following error message appears: "Restore Windows - The application OpenOffice.org
  was forced to quit while trying to restore its windows.  Do you want to try to restore its
  windows again?". If you cannot get rid of it: Option-click the "Go" menu; choose "Library"
  from the menu to open the folder in the Finder; click on the folder "Saved Application State";
  delete the file "org.openoffice.script.savedState". See <a
  href="https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=119006">bug 119006</a> for more
  information.</li>

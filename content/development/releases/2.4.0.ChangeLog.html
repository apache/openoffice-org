      <td>feature-info:<br>

With the integration of CWS dba24c, you will be able to edit views in
embedded HSQL databases.
In the context menu of views (as well as in the Edit menu of the main
window, as usual), the entry "Edit" will be available, which opens the
same UI as used when creating a new view, or creating or editing
queries (vulgo: The Query Designer).
As a consequence, when you create a new view and save it, the query
designer will *not* automatically close itself after saving (which was
previously done since altering the view statement was not possible
anymore).
With this, views now behave more like queries than before.
One notable difference is that the UI information of the view design -
table window layout, column widths, and the like - are not preserved.
That is, after changing this UI layout, and saving and re-opening the
view design, the UI layout will be lost. This is due to the fact that
it cannot be stored (in opposite to the view's statement, naturally)
in the underlying database. </td>

      <td>feature-info:<br>

With the integration of CWS dba24c, you will be able to invoke the
query designer not only for the "Content" property of a database form
(if it's content type is "SQL command"), but also for the list content
of a list box control (or grid column), if its list content type is
"SQL".
The SQL command which you design in the query designer will, when
saving it, be set as the respective property at the list box. </td>

      <td>&nbsp; </td>

      <td>feature-info:<br>

From within the property browser for a database form, you can open the
query designer, to graphically design the SQL command underlying the
form.
With the integration of CWS dba24c, this is also possible when the
"Escape processing" property of the form is set to "No", which is
usually done when you enter a SQL command which is not understood by
Base's parser, but by the database engine.
In such a case, the designer is opened in SQL mode (as opposed to
graphical mode), where you can enter the mere SQL command somewhat
more conveniently than in the property browser. The "Run SQL command
directly" setting in the designer's toolbar will be ON then.
Adequately, changing the "Run SQL command directly" setting will be
reflected in the "Escape processing" property of the form whose
command is currently being designed.
Also, the same functionality is available for list boxes, whose list
content, in case of a list content type "SQL command (native)", can
also be edited in the query designer's SQL view. </td>

      <td>There are some Options in the Applications Draw/Impress

which were historically used to reduce display complexity. They were
implemented at times where a screen refresh was drastically slower when
showing layouted texts, complex fills or thick lines. None of this
mechanisms is really useful today, but increases UI and code
complexity, especially further support when migrating to more modern
display mechanisms. I already discussed with all involved project
owners and everyone agrees that removal of that options is the best
thing to do. </td>

Koffice.New extensions are used to be able to divide the new from the

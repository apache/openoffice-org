<h1>URE&nbsp;1.0 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The Uno Runtime Environment (URE) is the well-known UNO component model of
OpenOffice.org, packaged up as an individual product.  It offers you a flexible,
low-overhead component model that is most ideal for (but not limited to)
combining in one application components written in different computer languages,
and developed by different parties.  You can use it to create any kind of
application, in whatever application domain you can imagine.  The URE is made
available under the LGPL.</p>

<p>URE&nbsp;1.0 (released at the same time as OpenOffice.org&nbsp;2.0) comes as
a platform-native installation set.  See the included <code>README</code> file
for further information.</p>

<p>If you want to program for the URE, you additionally need the OpenOffice.org
Software Development Kit (SDK), available at <a
href="http://download.openoffice.org"><code>download.openoffice.org</code></a>.
Tests and examples accompanying the URE are available as
<code>uretest.zip</code> in any OpenOffice.org build
(<code>common.pro/bin/uretest.zip</code>) or for easy download at the
<code>udk.openoffice.org</code> <cite>Documents &amp; files</cite> section at <a
href="http://udk.openoffice.org/files/documents/23/2909/uretest.zip"><code
>http://udk.openoffice.org/files/documents/23/2909/uretest.zip</code></a>.</p>

<p><em>Have fun!</em></p>

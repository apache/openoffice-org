feature-info:<br>

Image controls can now be bound to images which are embedded in the
document where the control lives in.
More precise, when you select an image to be displayed at an image
control, the "Link" option in the file picker is not disabled anymore.
When you uncheck the option (the default is "checked", to mimic the
legacy behavior), then the image is displayed in the control, and upon
saving the document, it's embedded in the document itself.
This way, you can create documents with image controls which are
exchangeable with other people/installations/platforms, which formerly
was much more difficult due to the need to also copy the images, and
place them in exactly the same location as on the originating machine
(which often is simply impossible).
Thanks for Noel Power for providing the patch for this.

feature-info:<br>

At the moment, when you create a file-based database (such as dBase or
Spreadsheet), the URL to the files (let's call it the "data URL") is
stored in
an absolute manner - that is, something like "file:///c:/foo/bar".
As a result, when you move the database document (the .odb file),
together with
the underlying data, to another machine, you need to either duplicate
the file
structure on this target machine, or to adjust the settings for the
database.
Now it is possible that the path is stored relatively when the option
"Save URLs relative to file system" setting in the
"Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Load/Save" dialog is checked.

"Empty string is NULL" behavior refined

feature-info:<br>

In the course of fixing issue 90403 and issue 92471, the behavior of
form controls whose "Empty string is NULL" property is set to "Yes"
has been refined. This change might make existing forms behave
slightly different than before, but certainly more
expectation-conformant now.
First, the property is now also respected when you never touched the
respective control before saving the record. That is, imagine a
control which has this property set to "Yes", this way declaring that
if the control contains an empty string, then this should be
propagated to the database as (the dedicated) NULL value.
Formerly, when you moved to the insertion row of the form, so the
control was initially empty, entered some data into other controls of
the current record, and saved the record without actually touching the
first control, then it actually updated an empty string. Now, with the
change, it updates NULL, as this is what "Empty String is NULL" =
"Yes" requests.
Second, when a control was bound to a database column which was
declared as NOT NULL, then the control *always* updated an empty
string instead of NULL, no matter what its "Empty string is NULL"
property requested. Effectively, this killed server-side defaults of
database fields, as such defaults are only applied when the field is
NULL. Now, with the change, controls always update NULL in such a
setup, this way enabling server-side defaults.

Image controls in database forms can now be bound to text columns.
Formerly, you could only bind them to columns whose content could
reasonably be interpreted as binary (BLOB etc.). Now, when you select
a text database column as source for the image control, then it will
interpret the content of the respective column's content as URL, and
load and display the image pointed to by this URL. Also, the URL might
be relative to the document which the image control is embedded into.

form controls: new property "Input Required"

      <td>
feature-info:<br>

All form controls which can be bound to a database column (i.e. have
the "Data field" property) now have a new property called "Input
required".
Description
=========
This property controls whether or not the input of this field is
checked against being empty (NULL). It is evaluated for controls which
are bound to a database field which is defined as required (i.e. which
is not allowed to contain the special NULL value), immediately before
the current record of the form is to be written into the database.
If the property is set to "Yes", and the field contains no input when
the current record is to be written to the database, then an error
message will be shown to the user, and the respective control will be
focused afterwards. Note that this is the known behaviour so far - the
property defaults to "Yes" so that newly created controls behave as
they would do in previous OOo versions.
If the property is set to "No", and the field contains no input when
the current record is to be written to the database, then this is
ignored. It's up to the underlying database to either reject the
update, or fill the respective column with a server-side default value.
Functional Constraints
=================
If the "Form data input checks for required fields" option in the
advanced settings of the database document (Edit / Database / Advanced
Settings ...) is *not* checked, then the "Input required" property for
all controls in all forms in this database document does not have any
effect, since the document-wide setting overrules the per-control
settings.
UI
==
In the property browser, the "Input required" is located immediately
below the "Empty string is NULL" property, if it is present, otherwise
immediately below the "Data field" property.
If the "Data field" is not set (i.e. empty), then "Input required" is
disabled, since it would be evaluated for bound controls only, anyway.
If the "Empty string is NULL" is set to "No", then "Input required" is
also disabled, since "Empty string is NULL" being "no" implies that
when the user does not enter any value in the control, then an empty
string, instead of the dedicated value NULL, is written, so there's
always a non-NULL value no matter the user's action.

image controls: scaling the image by keeping the ratio

      <td>
feature-info:<br>

Image form controls in documents got an additional mode for scaling
the image they display.
Previously, you could control the scaling by setting the "Scale"
property to "Yes" or "No" only, where "Yes" implied an anisotropic
scaling, i.e. one which distorted the image's dimensions.
Now, the "Scale" property allows the values "No" (same as before),
"Keep Ratio" and "Fit to Size" (equivalent to the old "Yes"). When
"Keep Ratio" is selected, the image is still scaled up or down to
match the control dimensions, but it's ratio is aspect kept constant.
This is especially useful for controls where the designer of the
document does not know, at time of designing the document/control, the
dimensions of the to-be-displayed images. In particular, this is
useful for image controls in database forms, displaying images
obtained from the database.

      <td>As practice has shown, it is a quite common case that
OOo is used to
edit documents of alien formats on network.
Unfortunately it looks to be impossible to let the file be locked
using file system locking, since it does not work in heterogeneous
file systems as expected, and the mentioned scenario has been
recognized as very important one. Thus the locking mechanics of OOo is
not recognizable for third-party applications, except they implement
support for OOo locking mechanics.
The implementation in childworkspace fwk94 let the alien files be
locked using the OOo file locking mechanics as well. That solves at
least the cases when a file of alien format is edited only by OOo3.x
in network. </td>

<h1>OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 Software Development Kit (SDK)</h1>

<p>The OpenOffice.org SDK is an add-on for the OpenOffice.org office suite. It provides the necessary tools and documentation for programming the
OpenOffice.org APIs and creating own extensions (UNO components) for OpenOffice.org.</p>
<br/>

<h2>What's new in OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 SDK?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Rebranding</b><br/>
      The branding of the SDK documentation pages has changed.</li>
  <li><b>MacOS and 64 bit Java</b><br/>
      Not really new but still important to know that if you use the 64 bit version (default on Snow Leopard) of Java on MacOS you have to use
      the -d32 switch to ensure that your program using the simple bootstrap mechasnism use a 32-bit data model.
      Otherwise you will get an UnsatisfiedLinkError when loading the PipeConnector.</li>
  <li><b>Examples</b><br/>
      There are still examples that are not working on Mac. There is still an issue with awt in the office with the Mac Java version.
      That means that it is not possible to use Java awt with OpenOffice.org on Mac OS right now.</li>
  <li><b>API's</b><br/>
      The OpenOffice.org API covers now 4185 UNO IDL type definitions. For OpenOffice.org 3.2.1 we have introduced no new UNO IDL types.
      The UNO IDL <a href="http://api.openoffice.org/docs/common/ref/com/sun/star/module-ix.html">reference</a> documentation gives you an overview of
      available types.</li>
</ul>

      <td>feature-info:<br>
Until now calling "soffice -calc" or "scalc" from the command line
could be used only for creating a new empty document. Adding a file
name to this command line ("soffice -calc foo.bar") resulted in two
windows, one with the empty Calc document, the other one with the file
opened in the default application for this file type.
There are two good reasons to change this:
(1) It is confusing.
(2) There are a lot of requests to open certain document types from
the desktop or the command line by an application different to the
default application OOo would chose for this file. Most often this
request is done for text files with arbitrary extensions (others than
csv) that should open in Calc.
Now soffice -calc foo.bar will open foo.bar in Calc if possible. That
means first OOo tries to
find a suitable Calc filter for the file and only if it doesn't find
any it proceeds as usual.
Of course this feature works for all applications (not only for Calc)
and on all platforms.
This feature can also be used for system integration, f.e. by
registering "scalc" as the default application for all files with
extension "bla". Then every doubleclick on a "bla" file will load it
into Calc (if possible, if not, OOo finds a suitable module). </td>

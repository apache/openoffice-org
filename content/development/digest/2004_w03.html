<a name="specs"></a>
<h2>So whats currently being implemented for OOo 2.0?</h2>
The next major version of OpenOffice.org is currently planned to be 2.0 and is
hoped to be released sometime in early 2005.
<p>
So what features are planned for version 2.0 ?<br>
There are alot of features planned, many of them to help with the compatability with MSOffice,
many to improve performance (especially startup performance), more usability improvements,
better desktop integration, easier administration, and some extra XML features.
The general concept document giving more context and a bit more detail for all of this is available
in the <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/q-concept.html">
Product Concept Document</a>
(OOo 2.0 is also codenamed "Q" similarily to OOo 1.1 being codenamed "Geordi")
<p>
The <a href="">OpenOffice.org Specification Project</a> currently contains over 70 document which explain
exactly how these concepts will be implemented. <br>
Many of these documents contian very specific implementation details with proposed screen shots,
shortcuts, and APIs. You can comment on all of these documents, but be aware (and have a look
at the CVS digest) that many of these features are currently being implemented.
The categories available are : Writer(24 documents), Application Wide(14), Calc(12), (data)Base(10),
General User Interface(6), Globalization(3), Scripting Framework(1), and Installation(1).
There are currently no specification documents available for the other projects.

<h2>In Other Development News</h2>
<h3>Release of developers snapshot m20</h3>
The developers snapshot <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/680_m20_snapshot.html">m20</a>
has been released. Changes in most areas including new controls, a dialog factory which
will be used to improve performace by loading dialogs only when they are first needed,
many improvements to controls, continues improvement in compatability for MSWord files and RTF files.

<a name="thesauri"></a>
<h3>OOo thesauri development</h3>
Giuseppe Modugno has written an application (called <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ooodocs/thescoder.zip?download">thescoder</a>) which creates the
files needed by the thesaurus in OOo from a simple list of words in text format.<p>
The advantages of thescoder in comparison to previous solutions are:
<ul>
<li>it is possible to insert spaces among different synonymous
<li>if a synonym is not also present as word, such word
<li>is added automaticly without synonymous (it is displayed a warning for such operation)
<li>if a word is present without synonymous this is preserved (and also in this case a line of warning is displayed)
<li>the list of words doesn't necessarily have to be sorted
</ul>
This tool is <a href="http://native-lang.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=2298">
already being used</a> by the <a href="http://it.openoffice.org">Italian OpenOffice.org Lang Project</a>


<a name="native_za"></a>
<h3>Native Lang Translation Tools</h3>
The <a href="http://translate.org.za">translate.org.za</a> project has been working on the
localization for several South African languages including Zulu, and Africans.
Many of these tools may be useful for other native-lang teams.
<p>
Some of these tools include:
<ul>
<li>oo2po - converts gsi style translation files to the Gettext PO format.
  This makes it possible to use many of the rich featured PO editors
such as Kbabel and POedit instead of a text editor.
<li>po2csv - converts PO files to comma seperated value (CSV). We needed
this for translators running Windows so that they could edit the
translations in a spreadsheet.  Rather ironic doing OpenOffice.org
translations using Microsoft Excel.
</ul>
And of course tools to convert these back.
<ul>
<li>checker - checks for various portential errors in translations including:
<ul>
<li>starting and ending punctuation
<li>variables
<li>simple capitalisation
<li>accelerators
<li>whitespace only translation, translation = original and very short
translations
<li>escapes and quoting
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Dwayne Bailey writes:
<ul>"Currently checker only runs on PO files but the tests evaluate only the
strings and are seperate from the input format.
Checker is invaluable in idetifying some very silly mistakes and provide
a nice approach to cleaning up translations."
</ul>

The translate.org.za team also have started work on a portal to allow easier web-based
translations and they have a preliminary patch againts OOo to allow it to use GNU
Gettext for localisation. This makes OOo much more usefull and usable
on a Linux in that new localisations can be easily installed and
seperate from the main OOo build. Although this is not necessarily the direction that
will occur in OpenOffice.org for 2.0 as this approach is seen as quite specific to
Unix/Linux platforms.


<a name="grammar"></a>
<h3>The start of a grammar checker?</h3>
Many people request that a grammar checker be added to OOo, but as many would remain quite
happy without it as they consider most languages to be much more complex than a grammar
checker could really deal with. They say that in general grammar checkers give as many
false warnings and many people also complain that they do not give warnings when they should.
<p>
However, as we are dealing with open source software, if there is an itch it will get scratched.
As <a ref="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=326">reported on
the native-lang list</a>, in this case Kevin Patrick Scannell, the author of the
myspell-ga package for openoffice, has written a GPL grammar checker for Irish called <a
href="http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/index.html">An Gramad&oacute;ir</a> (and for those of you
who are unsure that is Gaeilge Irish).

<a name="api_newsletter"></a>
<h3>The dev@api.openoffice.org newsletter</h3>
The dev@api.openoffice.org mailing list is used to ask questions about using the OOo object model
and associated APIs.
Michael Hoennig posted the <a href="http://api.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=9299">
December API newsletter</a> to the list. Topics include:
<ul>
<li>JVM Configuration for OpenOffice.org/StarOffice;

<h3>Developers Guides in multiple languages</h3>
The <a href="http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/817-1826?q=StarOffice">StarOffice 7 Software Basic Programmer's Guide</a>
 provides an introduction to StarBasic and the API and provides a lot of useful hints
for migrating from another well known Basic language to StarBasic/OpenOffice.org Basic.<p>
This document is now available in :

<a name="icons"></a>
<h3>Separation of icon set from build process</h3>
On the <a href="http://installation.openoffice.org">installation project</a> dev mailing list there was a
<a href="http://installation.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=423">short email</a>
on how to deal with different icon set in OOo in the future.
<br>
The idea is to separate the different sets of pixel graphics in a zip-archive.
This probably also means separating these graphics from the build process.
But this conversation is not finished yet, so stay tuned.

<a name="macosx"></a>
<h3>Separate builds of 1.1.1 for Mac OSX 10.2 and 10.3</h3>
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=releases&msgNo=6686">Kevin B. Hendricks mentions</a>
that for Mac OS X we are going to need to have separate Panther and Jaguar builds in the long run anyway.
Right now a build on Panther it will not run on Jaguar and a Jaguar build will probably not run on Panther either.
<br><bold>If you are an Apple developer</bold> and would like to see OpenOffice.org on Mac OSX why not contribute a small
amount of time and see how you can help on the <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org">porting</a> dev mailing list.

<a name="mingw"></a>
<H3>MinGW + tcsh build efforts started</h3>
The <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> compiler is a "collection of GNU toolsets that allow one to produce native Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C runtime DLLs". With this work it be should be possible to compile OOo code on Windows without having to have the latest version of Visual .Net tools from Microsoft.
<br>
A few patches are currently needed and they are listed in IZ<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=24588">#24588</a>. If you want to comtribute or to ask a question the <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org">porting project</a> dev mailing list is the right place to ask.


<a name="multiple"></a>
<h3>Multiple-Inheritance Interface Types</h3>
On the <a href="http://udk.openoffice.org">UDK</a> dev mailing list Stephan Bergmann <a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=2307">wrote</a> to tell
us about the <a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/draft/multinherit.html">Multiple-Inheritance
Interface Types</a> for UNO APIs.

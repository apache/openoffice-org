development.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Following what's happening in OpenOffice.org code development is not so
easy, not because there is no information, but rather because that
there is so much information and it is so spread out. Hopefully this
digest will help to summarize all of that information into something
reasonably readable and useful.
<p>Most of this digest will be concerned with what code has changed in
CVS, and presenting that info in a readable format, but I also hope to
include news and information from other OpenOffice.org projects
including <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org">QA</a>, <a
 href="http://native-lang.openoffice.org">native language projects</a>,
<a href="http://api.openoffice.org">API</a>, and any other interesting
projects.</p>
<p>Obviously I could really use help with all of this so if you have
something you would like to contribute, or you see ommisions or
mistakes please <a
 href="mailto:cphennessy@openoffice.org?subject=OOo%20Digest%20Suggestion">email
me</a> your contribution to the digest.</p>
<p>Some of the areas which are not related to development I do not plan
on covering, these include the <a href="http://user-faq.openoffice.org">user
support</a> lists, <a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org">marketing</a>,
<a href="http://documentation.openoffice.org">documentation</a>, and
the <a href="http://website.openoffice.org">website</a>. However, I
will include any interesting news sent to me about these projects.</p>
<p><a name="intro_help"></a></p>
<h3>So how can I help?</h3>
There are several teams who could do with your help :
<ul>
  <li>for the non-programmers there is the <a
 href="http://qa.openoffice.org">QA team</a> where you can help to get
enough details to reproduce bugs and triage them, help the <a
 href="http://documentation.openoffice.org">documentation project</a>
by contributing templates and clipart, and the <a
 href="http://native-lang.openoffice.org">localization projects</a> (
e.g. <a
 href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=965426&amp;listName=dev">help
to improve compound word spellchecking</a> );</li>
  <li>for the script programmer there is the <a
 href="http://api.openoffice.org">API project</a> where you can develop
on top of OpenOffice.org and program in StarBasic ( very similar to VBA
), java, python, C++, and perl. A good project to learn the object
model on and improve your OpenOffice.org scripting skills might be the <a
 href="http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/">bibliographic project</a>
where a <a
 href="http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=965024/&amp;listName=dev">programmer
new to python and OpenOffice.org APIs</a> was able to help after only a
few days!;</li>
  <li>for the XML programmers, there are also interesting projects
which you could help write using various technologies to transform
OpenOffice.orgs based XML based to other formats. Two transforms which
come with OpenOffice.org 1.1 are DocBook, and XHTML. There is
infrastructure to use XSLT directly from OpenOffice.org, but there are
also several projects which are generating OpenOffice.org formatted
files outside of the OpenOffice.org suite. To help get you started, <a
 href="http://books.evc-cit.info/">OpenOffice.org XML Essentials?Using
OpenOffice.org?s XML Data Format</a> is a book in progress written by
J. David Eisenberg for <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O?Reilly
&amp; Associates</a> using the <a
 href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0">Creative
Commons License</a>.</li>
  <li>for the developer there are many areas to get involved in
including a call for helping to <a
 href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=965426/&amp;listName=dev">improve
the code for the spellchecker ( especially for German)</a>(which is
also use in Mozilla.org), help to <a
 href="http://sc.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=965017/&amp;listName=dev">increase
the number of rows Calc can handle</a>, or <a
 href="mailto:dev@gsl.openoffice.org">help with the native widget
framework</a> for Aqua or KDE ports which compliment the official Win32
and GTK work.
    <p>It is not always necessary to recompile all of OpenOffice.org to
work on only one of its components, but if you do then a very good
place to start would be the <a
 href="http://ooo.ximian.com/hackers-guide.html">Unofficial OpenOffice
Hacker's guide</a> which explains how to build and work on
OpenOffice.org source code. If you have development related questions
then please send an email to <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">the
development project</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
Over the next number of weeks and months I hope to add more information
here to help you understand how and where you can contribute, how
OpenOffice.org the community works, and how the various components
within OpenOffice.org the product work.
<p><a name="intro_branches"></a></p>
<h3>So what are all these branches?</h3>
There is alot of OpenOffice.org development happening as can be seen
from the details below.
<p>As with many very large projects with many developers, development
is going on independently in parallel. To help manage the code in a
reasonable way a feature of <a href="http://www.cvshome.org">CVS</a>
called branches is used quite extensively. Basically each major feature
is developed on a branch by one developer (or a small team of
developers).<br>
This type of branch is called a "child workspaces"(CWS). Usually when a
feature has been completed and some fundamental testing has been
performed, the branch is then marked as ready for merging to a master
branch.<br>
Sometime later the developers branch with the feature is then merged to
the "master workspace"(MWS) branch where further testing happens to
make sure that features from different branches do not conflict and
cause errors.</p>
<p>At some point a master branch is labelled and a public release of
code is made.</p>
<p>An overview of which features will be implement on which branches
can be found <a
 href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/OOo_2_0_timetable.html">here</a>.
There is a <a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/builds/index.html">more
complete (and accurate) description of important branches currently used</a>.</p>
<p><a name="intro_cvs"></a></p>
<h2>Current organization and contents of the CVS log</h2>
The CVS summary linked below is organized into what has changed on a
particular branch by a each developer. There is currently a color
coding on the left side to make it easier to see what type of change
has occured. For each change you should see :
<ul>
  <li>a link to the relevant bug in <a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/query.cgi">IssueTracker</a>
(except for bugs over 100000 as these are currently Sun internal);</li>
  <li>a comment the developer made while checking in those changes; and</li>
  <li>a link to the difference of each change in webcvs.</li>
</ul>
There is also two indexes, the first lists all of the development
branches and logically groups these branches.<br>
The second index lists all of the OpenOffice.org components which were
worked on and lists those branches which have changes on those
components.

<h2>In Other Development News</h2>
<h3>Easier builds for MacOSX Panter</h3>
<a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=users&amp;msgNo=51329">Building
OOo for MacOSX 10.3 ( Panther) is now reasonably easy</a>, but
volunteers are desparately needed to build and package on 10.2 and 10.1.<br>
<h3>Contributions from the Japanese project</h3>
Takamichi Akiyama wrote to me about developments contributed by the
members of&nbsp; the <a href="http://ja.openoffice.org">Japanese
project</a>:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Graphic Applications (aka graphics)<a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=9391"><br>
Enabling the DXF import filter to handle Japanese texts</a><br>
Status: Done (Integrated in OOo 1.1.1)<br>
Todos: To cover more encoding types for other languages<br>
    <br>
OOo 1.0 can import a DXF file, but cannot properly handle Japanese
texts in it. This effort has solved this problem caused by ethnic text
encoding and given OOo more flexibility.<br>
DXF file format is one of the AutoCAD drawing file formats, especially
designed for data exchange between different application software.It is
composed of certain sections and includes drawing objects such as a
line, polyline, oval, text, and so forth. A type of encoding is stated
in the HEADER section and texts are encoded in the encoding type.<br>
Mr. Miyazaki, a member of ja.openoffice.org, initially reported this
issue in November, 2002 and Tora collected related information, then,
Kevin B. Hendricks wrote source codes for this new function.
HiranoKazunari verified it. Stefan Baltzer, wg, sj and msc have kindly
supported us.</li>
  <li>Graphic System Layer (aka gsl)<br>
    <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=22367">Finding
out font names of garbage characters in Asian version</a><br>
Status: Done (Integrated in cws_src680)<br>
OOo Asian versions sometime display unexpected garbage characters due
to insufficient font names in the default font name lists that keep
several different font names for each specific use such as UI, fixed,
etc. Linux distributions vary and their primary Asian font name might
differ, and thus, OOo's default font name list could be improved in
order to cover such Linux variants.<br>
This debug version of vcl module helps users find out a font name that
is improperly chosen and used for displaying Asian characters,
resulting in garbage characters. Instructions and sample outputs are
available in a&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&amp;msgId=951064">post</a>
by Hirano Kazunari.<br>
For quick solution to the garbage characters, find out the improper
font name and replace it with correct one using Tools &gt; Options
menu. For practical solution, tune up the default font name list in
share/registry/data/org/openoffice/VCL.xcu on the basis of the debug
outputs.<br>
This effort comes from Herbert Duerr's debug codes and Tora's
additional codes. Hirano Kazunari has tested it on his Linux machines
and widely informed this function to the OOo community.<br>

<h3>Contributions from the French project</h3>
Sophie Gautier wrote to me to tell me of the various contributions from
the <a href="http://fr.openoffice.org">French project</a>:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=23428">Integration
of dictionaries installation macro for 1.1.1</a><br>
This macro by Laurent Godard should help users to install the relevant
dictionaries for their needs. This will be a much appreciated item on
the <a href="mailto:users@openoffice.apache.org">users</a> mailing list</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=20181">OOoVirg
integration</a><br>
This is a mechanism by R&eacute;my Peyronnet to allow the use of a
comma instead of a period as a decimal separator. Very useful for
French, Spanish, and many other languages.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.oooconv.de">A new home for OOoConv</a> <br>
OOoConv is a website where you can upload your OOo documents and get
them translated into many supported formats. This site is also has
interfaces in many languages for our international users.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=23756">Pinceau</a>(a
brush to duplicate styles)<br>
Another useful add-on.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Progress on native widgets for GTK/KDE/Win32/Aqua</h3>
The <a
 href="http://gsl.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&amp;msgNo=1167">progress</a>
of the integration of native widgets for GTK, KDE, and Win32 desktops
also received alot of attention. This is still moving along quite well
and alot of progress seems to happen each day. The collaboration
between the GTK and KDE developers is excellent. However the work on
the Aqua widgets could really do with some <a
 href="http://gsl.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&amp;msgNo=1168">help</a>.<br>
<br>
<h3>Release of developers snapshot m17</h3>
A developers snapshot release (read do not even consider this alpha
quality) called <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/680/index.html">680_m17</a>
is now available and contains many bug fixes (including valgrind
indicated problems, cleanup of compiler flags for gcc, and more VCL
cleanups). This builds on the earlier developer snapshot releases <a
 href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/680_m15_snapshot.html">m15</a>
(with the new VCL plug which will allow native toolkits to be used
instead of the OpenOffice.org one, improvements to the scripting
framework, lots of compatability and rtl fixes, improvement in graphics
handling and the draw tool, and changes in the installation process), <a
 href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/680_m13_snapshot.html">m13</a>
(mostly bug fixes), and <a
 href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/680_m11_snapshot.html">m11</a>(with
many features). Note the temporary <a
 href="http://graphics.openoffice.org/unbranded-source/browse/%7Echeckout%7E/graphics/svx/res/Attic/openintro_sun.bmp?rev=1.1.2.1&amp;content-type=image/bmp">splash
screen</a>! ( <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">Maybe you can
contribute</a>? )<br>
<b>Note: these are all developers releases so be careful and do not
complain if it crashes, burns and/or eats your computer! </b>However
if you do test these please report all errors in IssueTracker (to
report a bug or request a feature http://openoffice.org -&gt;
"Register", then when you receive a confirmation email, "Login" and
"File an issue" ).<br>
<br>
As progress to the next major release there should be <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">development snapshots every 2 weeks</span>
with more features for you to examine. <br>
<h3>Convertor from xfig to OOo draw</h3>
Alexander B&uuml;rger <a
 href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&amp;msgNo=9419">announced</a>
a program to convert files from xfig format to OOo Draw. This program
is now in a usable state (for Linux) and available for <a
 href="http://fig2sxd.sourceforge.net">download</a>.&nbsp; There are
still a few issues but it is generally very usable.<br>
<br>

<br>
Please note that even though the unconfirmed issues remain a bit high,
the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org">QA</a> team is really doing
some great work in keeping the bugs triaged ready for developers to
disect. If you dedicate some of your energy on this project it would be
very worth while.

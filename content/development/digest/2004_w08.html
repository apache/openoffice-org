<h3> New cvs module scp2 instead of scp </h3>
<span class="author">Ingo Schmidt</span> wrote to the dev@porting mailing list
to tell them about the replacement of an old core module with a new module.
<div class="quote">
Beginning in src680m25 (post cws_src680_ooo20040225) <i>[Ed:and hence in m26 above]</i>
the new cvs module
scp2 replaces the old scp module. The old scp is no longer part of the
build process. scp2 is the new module describing the OOo installation sets.
<p>
<h3>Why these changes?</h3>

The new scp structure allows the creation of difference scp files in
which you can define and undefine scp defintions to describe the
difference of two products.
<p>
Example: To undefine the defintion of gid_File_Abc you only need to add
in the scp project the following code line:
<code>
UnFile gid_File_Abc
</code>
and the file defined with gid_File_Abc is no longer part of the product.
<p>
There is another big advantage. Because of the undefining mechanism it
is no longer necessary to use product defines like #ifdef OSL_PRODUCT
inside the scp files. Therefore every scp file will only be built once,
leading to a dramatic decrease of build time for the scp2 project
compared with the old scp project.
The removal of product defines inside scp files also leads to more
simplicity of this files.
<p>
A more detailed documentation of the new scp can be found
<a href ="http://installation.openoffice.org/How_to_scp_in_ooo.html">here</a>

<h3> N steps to adding a new menu entry </h3>

<span class="author">Duncan Foster</span> (from the scripting project) recently was
working on add a new menu entry for a scripting need. I asked him to summarize the steps necessary
as it may be of interest to others. He kindly responded with :
<div class="quote">
First note that in the OOo 2.0 tree, some or all of this is going to
change in the near future. I think the slots stuff will remain the same,
just the way the menu entries are defined. Also note that the following
is based on experience of working in the SRC680 branch. I think the menu
entries have changed slightly from SRX645, with things being moved out
of the offmgr project.
<p>
So, say for example I want to add an entry, "Script organizer", below
the entry "macro..." in the Tools->Macro sub-menu.
<p>
The first step is define a new "slot" that links the menu entry to the
code that it will execute. these are defined in sfx2/inc/sfxsids.hrc. I
define a new slot SID_SCRIPTORGANIZER to be same value as the existing
SID_SFX_free_START, and incremented the SID_SFX_free_START by one.
<p>
Next I define the link between the slot, and the code that handles it.
For my slot, the application code should handle the execution so this is
done in sfx2/sdi/appslots.sdi. See also other files in this directory,
or similar sdi directories in other modules (eg basctl).
<p>
In the section that starts "shell SfxApplication" I add the lines:
<pre>
SID_SCRIPTORGANIZER
[
        ExecMethod = OfaExec_Impl;
]
</pre>
which means that my slot will be handled by the method
<pre>
SfxApplication::OfaExec_Impl.
</pre>
Then in sfx2/source/appl/appserv.cxx I add code to the method
SfxApplication::OfaExec_Impl to handle the case for the new slot.
<p>
In sfx2/sdi/sfx.sdi, I duplicate the SID_BASICCHOOSER entry, and change
"MacroDialog" to "ScriptOrganizer", and SID_BASICCHOOSER to
SID_SCRIPTORGANIZER.
<br>
This is the slot definition file
where attributes for a slot can be defined, like this is a user
interface command which can be customized to tool bars, menus and
accelerators. You can define if the slot is a state, a function or both.
You can add parameters and define the type of a state slot. Don't ask me
what the entries mean!!
<p>
In sfx2/sdi/sfxslots.src, added an SfxSlotInfo for the slot. These are
the localized names for the slot.
<p>
Build & delivered in sfx2. We now have the back end, handling the execution.
<p>
The actual menu entries are defined in a number of places. For things
that are duplicated across several apps, such as the Tools->Macros
submenu, we find the definition in svx/inc/globlmn.hrc. Here I add a new
menuItem for the new slot to the
ITEM_TOOLS_MACROS (using the existing entries as a template). The
identifier and helpid are the SID, the command
is .uno:ScriptOrganizer. The command name is what we will see if we
record a macro that uses this slot.
<p>
Run the built & deliver commands in svx. The globlnm.hrc is included in
offmgr/inc/offmenu.hrc, so we must build & deliver this project too.
And then rebuild each of the application projects (sw, sc...). This is
necessary to deliver the slot.ilb files which are merged from lower
libraries. And finally build in instsetoo and install the rebuild app with your new
menu entry!!

<h2> Other development news </h2>
<a name="oasis"></a>
<h3> Oasis Open Office file format status </h3>
The Oasis Technical committee on Open Office XML Formats had a meeting on Feburary 16th and the meeting minutes are
<a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/office/200402/msg00019.html">available</a>.
The specifictaion is at draft 6 at this stage, os it is getting very close to a final 1.0 release.

<h3> Interesting LinuxJournal feature articles </h3>
In the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=NS-lj-issues/issue119&file=index"
> March 2004</a> issue of Linux Journal there are several features which may be of interest to OOo develoeprs
including :
<div class="quote">
      The OASIS Standard for Office Documents  by Marco Fioretti<br>
       A common file format lets apps compete on features and ease of use.
</div>
and
<div class="quote">
      Manipulating OOo Documents with Ruby  by James Britt<br>
       XML and Ruby let your scripts and your office suite handle the
same files.
</div>
There are also other articels in that issue which are of more interest to users.

<h3> Encouraging more developers </h3>
During a conversation on the discuss mailing list I asked what people thought would be
of interest to prospective developers to help them understand and use OpenOffice.org APIs.
<span class="author">Daniel Carrera</span> replied with:
<div class="quote">
This is what I think we should do to attrack developers:
<ol>
<li>Simplify the Python bindings. There seems to be a lot of unnecessary work that could be done behind the scenes.

<li>Create Ruby bindings (Ruby is a fantastic language, imagie taking the best bits of Perl and Python and then making it better).
<p>
<p>
(steps 1 and 2 would make it easier to develop for OOo).

<li>Write tutorials that walk the reader through making simple extensions using Ruby or Python.
</ol>
</div>
<span class="author">Alexandro Colorado</span> (the Spanish translator of this digest)
replied with his own comment and list :
<div class="quote">
The Developer's guide successfully goes through a remote
script-generated OOo document. So does the PyUNO binding, however I
would love to see more of these tutorials, independent from the
developer guide.

Something like:
<ul>
<li>How-To make your first plug-in
<li>From SXW to XHTML - a XSLT Tutorial
<li>Launching a calculator software from OpenCalc
<li>Explaining VCL - How OOo interface really work
<li>Make OOo your publishing app - OODocuments
<li>Transform your OOo aplication into your RSS blog feeder XML-RPC and
XSLT
</ul>
I love the way the kde-look developer used Tcl to skin OpenOffice.org, a
tutorial to maybe do it in some other language (using native OOo
bindings) could also be interesting. Of course this is a little harder.

<H1>The OpenOffice.org Development Digests</H1>
<H4>
This is the index page for the development digests where I hope to be able to
bring the general OpenOffice.org development community (and the "lurkers") a reasonable
summary of each weeks news, hopefully some new development info so that the beginners
and lurkers can also contribute, a summary of Issuezilla statistics and a digest of the CVS activity.
</H4>
If you would like to contribute or see something in particular in the weekly digest then please <a href="mailto:cphennessy@openoffice.org">drop me an email</a>.

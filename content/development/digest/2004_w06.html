<h2>New Canvas API status</h2>
I asked Thorsten Behrens about the status of the new Canvas API
and he wrote to tell me :<p>
<div class="quote">
The new 2D graphics output API, dubbed the 'Canvas API', is a
candidate to replace VCL's OutputDevice as OOo's standard rendering
facility. The API was designed with contemporary graphic subsystems
like Java2D, Windows GDI+ or Cairo/XRender in mind, and should support
most modern concepts like paths, affine transformations and alpha
compositing now standard across graphics APIs (and lacking in
VCL). Since the Canvas API is based on UNO, it is more or less a
runtime-choice which implementation to use: if you as a developer are
dissatisfied with speed or quality or what else of one of our default
canvas implementations, it's simply a matter of downloading the SDK,
implementing the fraction of the API we're currently using, and
registering your component with OOo as the new instance to use for
canvas rendering.
<p>
Speaking of, we currently have working canvas implementations based on
VCL, Java2D and, for Windows, a native GDI+/DirectX version. You will
notice that native implementations for X11 and MacOS are missing from
this list, so this would be an opportunity for volunteers to help out:
MacOS X should probably map directly to Carbon; for X11, I would give
Cairo/XRender a try, which is comparably high-level and gives you
anti-aliased rendering for free.
</div>
You can browse the new Canvas APIs <a href="http://gsl.openoffice.org/canvas/api/module-ix.html">here</a>.

<h2>Second pre-release of 1.1.1</h2>
Martin Hollmichel on the <a href="mailto:releases@openoffice.org">releases@openoffice.org</a> mailing list
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=releases&msgNo=6746">announced</a> the next pre-release
of OpenOffice.org, 1.1.1b. There are about 90 more bugs fixed in this pre-release compared to 1.1.1a.
<p>
It is hoped that the next pre-release will be available within 2 weeks
and that it should be very close to a final version ready for the official 1.1.1 tag.

<h2>Native Language News</h2>
<a name="ca"></a>
<h3>Catalan version of 1.1.0</h3>
Alexandro Colorado (the translator of these digests into Spanish) forwarded an email from the
<a href="http://ca.openoffice.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=users&msgNo=36">Catalan users mailing list</a>
which informs us that Sun Microsystem and the Open University of
Catalunya have release OpenOffice.org 1.1.0 in Catalan.

<a name="lao"></a>
<h3>Lao native-lang site now live</h3>
On the <a href="mailto:dev@native-lang.openoffice.org">dev@native-lang.openoffice.org</a> Anousak Souphavanh wrote to
tell us that the
<div class="quote">
Lao team his finally completed the translation and we uploaded files to the server: <a href="http://lo.openoffice.org">
http://lo.openoffice.org</a>. It's now live and fully functional.

<h3>224 page users document available in Japanese</h3>
Yutaka Kachi emailed the <a href="mailto:dev@native-lang.openoffice.org">dev@native-lang.openoffice.org</a>
list to inform them about the release of a 224 page user document for Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, and data sources.
<div class="quote">
You can download sxw-file and pdf-file from [Documents & files] section
of <a href="http://ja.openoffice.org">ja.openoffice.org</a>.
<p>
In 2002, I wrote a guidebook titled "OpenOffice.org 1.0 StartKit"
to describe an older version of OpenOffice.org.
"OpenOffice.org Open Manual 1.0.0" is an improved version of
this commercial guidebook.
<p>
Creation of this document is sponsored by IPA(Japan Information-technology
 Promotion Agency). I had the cooperation of AIST(National Institute of
Advanced Industrial Science and Technology), Good-day Inc and mokuba-sha.
I would like to say thank you to everybody who gave me a chance and support
me to create this document.
</div>
Yutaka release the document under the PDL license and will be maintaining this document.
He also welcomes translations of this user document.

<h2>In Other Development News</h2>

<h3>GDB weekly snapshot now contains support for pending breakpoints</h3>
Caol&aacute;n McNamara wrote to tell the <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org</a> mailing list
about
<div class="quote">
the latest <a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/gdb/snapshots/current">gdb weekly snapshot</a> which now
contains support for "pending breakpoints", aka future-breakpoints, aka deferred-breakpoints. So you can place
breakpoints on methods and lines in sourcefiles which cannot be resolved at insertion time.
</div>
The gdb tool is used by developers to debug programs and this feature is very helpful when trying to
debug a program with a lot of shared libraries, as currently you have to wait until the library you want to
examine is loaded before you can insert a breakpoint. This new features means that you can insert the breakpoint
before the shared library is actually loaded.

<h3>Thessalonica: a new package for multilingual word processing in OOo</h3>
Alexej Kryukov emailed the <a href="mailto:users@openoffice.apache.org">users@openoffice.apache.org</a> mailing list to announce
a tool for multilingual word processing he migrated from MSWord to OOo so that he could work completely with OOo.
<div class="quote">
Thessalonica provides 2 main functions: it allows to easily input foreign (e. g. accented) characters using custom
input methods, and also to convert texts from various non-standard 8 bit encodings to Unicode and vice versa.
Currently all this functionality is oriented mainly to classical Greek, but Thessalonica may be adapted for other
languages, e.g. it also includes an input method for accented Latin letters.
<p>
Since Thessalonica for OOo is written in Python, it may be of interest also for OOo programmers as an example of
a large project based on PyUNO.
<p>
If you find Thessalonica useful, please consider supporting some issues mentioned in the documentation. Of course any
submissions like new conversion tables, input methods,translations of interface strings and/or help pages to other
languages are very welcome.

<h3>Opening Open Formats with XSLT</h3>
Bob DuCharme in  <a href="http://www.XML.com">XML.com</a> wrote<a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/02/04/tr-xml.html">
an article</a> explaining how he used XSLT on Impress slides to produce speaker notes:
<div class="quote">
Once I saw the XML that its slide presentation program created, it took me less time to write a stylesheet that did exactly what I wanted than it took to download OpenOffice over the conference hotel's T1 line.
</div>
As well as describing the exact XSLT used, Bob, finishes with:
<div class="quote">
OpenOffice's ability to read PowerPoint, Word, and Excel binary files and to then save them as XML means that XSLT developers can take advantage of vast new sets of data. You can also create documents using OpenOffice instead of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, and add XSLT stylesheets to your workflow to let coworkers do new things with their documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

<h3>Faire-part - Announcement Tool</h3>
Laurent Godard one of the macro experts announced on the <a href="mailto:dev@native-lang.openoffice.org">
dev@native-lang.openoffice.org</a> a new tool to
<div class="quote">
It is a draw document that let you build some announcements by folding a
sheet (something that i used long time ago in a "published" commercial
application

<h3>Mailing list problems</h3>
OpenOffice.org mailing lists were again severely affected by the MyDoom virus. It is hoped that new hardware for
the http://openoffice.org site will help the situation.

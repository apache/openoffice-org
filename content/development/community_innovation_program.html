<p align=center><strong>OFFICIAL RULES<br>
  NO PURCHASE NECESSARY</strong></p>
<h3>Update 2008-10-06</h3>
<p><strong>Awardees <a href="awardees-2008.html">announced</a>!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On 7 December 2007, Sun Microsystems Inc. <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/awards/index.jsp">announced</a> a new million-dollar program to foster innovation in six of the open-source projects it sponsors and contributes to. We are pleased to report that OpenOffice.org was included.</p>
<p>The “$1 Million Open Source Community Innovation Awards Program,” is generous in many ways. Although Sun will be handing out the actual cash and is ultimately the arbiter of who is eligible to be granted those cash awards, each community has been given the freedom, within limits, to devise its own focus and administer the program. </p>
<p>OpenOffice.org's interest lies in encouraging the development of technology and endeavours that advance the community and its products, and our Community is international. Accordingly, we have established “The OpenOffice.org Community Innovation Program,” which takes the form of a world-wide contest, with contestants competing for Gold, Silver, or Bronze prizes. Cash Prizes will be given to the winners in accordance with these Official Rules, as well as to those who have earned &quot;Honourable Mention,&quot; except where international legal considerations prohibit payments of this nature. In that case, OpenOffice.org will give the winners public honour and attention for their work.</p>
<p>A PDF version of these rules and other ancillary information can be found at <a href="community_innovation_program.pdf">http://development.openoffice.org/community_innovation_program.pdf</a>.
<br>
For examples see the
<a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Community_Innovation_Program/proposals">proposals for possible entries</a>.
These should be seen as suggestions, but should in no way limit the creativity of Entrants.

<ul>
  <li value=1>

  </li>
  <li>

If any persons appear in the Entry, the Entrant is responsible for obtaining, prior to sending the Entry, any and all releases and consents necessary to permit the exhibition and use of the Entry by Sponsor as set forth in these Official Rules. If any person appearing in any Entry is under the age of majority in their state, country or province of residence, the signature of a parent or legal guardian is required on each release.</p>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

</ul>
<h3>Categories of Interest</h3>
<p>Entries must be submitted in one of the following six categories. Entrants must specify the Category of Interest and can submit each Entry under one category only. If you are unsure about which Category to use, use “Special.”</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> <strong>Technical</strong>: core code, extensions, ports</p>
    <li>
      <p> <strong>Community</strong>: new methods of community cooperation, new marketing efforts, artwork, and other efforts that significantly further OpenOffice.org use and development, or the efficiency and effectiveness of the Community</p>
    <li>
      <p> <strong>Tools</strong>: those that help the community build, distribute, work on OpenOffice.org, including infrastructure development, localization tools, as well as a working environment, management system, and other developer support</p>
    <li>
      <p> <strong>OpenDocument Format (ODF)</strong>: work that advances ODF development, OpenOffice.org's implementation, or makes the ODF more accessible through the ODF Toolkit project </p>
    <li>
      <p> <strong>Documentation</strong>: both enduser and developer documentation and/or training materials; articles on OpenOffice.org for developers or endusers</p>
    <li>
      <p> <strong>Special: </strong>a catch-all category to submit innovative Entries that significantly further OpenOffice.org, its applications and projects, and furthers the Community as a whole</p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Note</strong>. All Entrants are urged to work with the Community using the accepted community tools, such as mail lists, forums, IRC channels, wikis, and so on. Entrants, whether individuals or teams, should work under the supervision of their OpenOffice.org project lead or leads (“Project Leads”). The judges will take into consideration community participation and consider the advice of the relevant Project Leads when judging. Entries submitted without the input of an OpenOffice.org Project Lead will be at a disadvantage in the judging.</p>
<h2>Judging</h2>
<p>All Entries, regardless of Category, will be judged by a committee comprised of members of the OpenOffice.org Community Council. This Community Innovation Program Committee (the “Program Committee”) will judge Entries on the following equally weighted criteria to decide, in its sole discretion if the Entry should be selected for one of the Four Award Levels outlined in the “Prizes” Section: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Originality, which includes the nature of the problem addressed and the innovative nature of the Entry;</p>
  <li>
    <p>The difficulty of the Entry, which includes the nature of the problem addressed and the difficulty in fashioning a solution;</p>
  <li>The current relevance of the Entry to the OpenOffice.org Community, and its completeness;
  <li>
    <p>The extent to which the Entry provides utility to the Community either by providing code that the Community uses and values or by fostering the Community's growth and development or; and</p>
  <li>
    <p>Community participation by the Entrant in developing the Entry. </p>
</ul>
<p> The Program Committee will consider the advice of the Project Leads in judging the entries in accordance with the criteria set forth above. An Entry that is submitted without having been worked on in the relevant project or projects and which is outside the supervision of any OpenOffice.org Project Lead (including Co-Lead) is at a disadvantage. Entrants are strongly encouraged to work within the community structure and with the Project Leads and other project members.</p>
<p>Note. </strong>The Program Committee reserves the right not to award any or all prizes in any Category or Award Level if, in their sole and absolute discretion, they do not receive a sufficient number of eligible or qualified Entries. In the event that more than one Entry is received with the same or nearly identical submission, only the first submitted Entry will be eligible. Winners will be notified by email on or around 21 July 2008, although the judging period may be extended without notice in the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Decisions of the Program Committee are final and binding in all respects.</p>
<h3>Prizes</h3>
<ul>
  <li value=1>
    <p> A maximum total of $175,000 USD may be awarded, provided that there are a sufficient number of meritorious Entries from eligible Entrants that meet the criteria set forth below.</p>
  <li>
    <p>Prizes are awarded for merit, meaning that it is entirely possible that there may be no winners in one Category of Interest or Award Level and several in another. </p>
  <li>
    <p>There are four Award Levels: Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Honourable Mention. </p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li value=1>
      <p> Gold Awards will recognize outstanding achievement in advancing the OpenOffice.org Community or product. Silver Awards will recognize a significant achievement, and Bronze Awards a substantial contribution. In its sole discretion, the Program Committee may recognize Entries that although they do not qualify for a Gold, Silver or Bronze Award, nevertheless satisfy each of the four criteria set forth above by being original, non- trivial, useful to the community, and produced through Community participation. </p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li value=1>
    <p> The total $175,000 USD cash prize fund will be divided among the Award Levels as follows: </p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li value=1>
      <p> Gold - $75,000 USD;</p>
    <li>
      <p> Silver - $50,000 USD;</p>
    <li>
      <p> Bronze - $25,000 USD;</p>
    <li>
      <p> Honourable Mention - $25,000 USD. </p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Gold, Silver, and Bronze Award Level cash prize pools will be divided equally among the Prize Eligible Territory Entrants selected by the Program Committee for that Award Level. The Honourable Mention Award Level cash prize pool will also be divided equally among the Prize Eligible Territory Entrants selected by the Program Committee for that Award Level; however, $5,000 USD is the maximum cash award that can be made to eligible Entrants selected for this prize pool. Any funds remaining in the Honourable Mention prize pool after the cash prizes have been made will be added to the Gold, Silver and Bronze prize pools in a 3:2:1 ratio.</p>
  <li>
    <p>If the Program Committee does not select any Prize Eligible Territory Entrants in one or more of the four Award Levels, the Sponsor reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to either (1) not award that prize money or (2) allocate that prize money in equal amounts to the remaining Award Level prize pools.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li value=1>
    <p> If the Program Committee selects an Entry for an Award Level, but the Entrant is not a legal resident of a Prize Eligible Territory, and therefore not eligible for a cash prize under this Program, the Entrant will receive a public declaration acknowledging that the Entry was selected for the particular Award Level.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If a team should win any Award and be eligible to receive the associated cash prize, the cash prize amount will be apportioned equally among the team members as identified at the time the Entry was submitted.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All amounts will be awarded in U.S. dollars and all costs associated with currency exchange are the sole responsibility of the winners.</p>
</ul>
<p>Other expenses and costs. </strong>All other expenses not specified herein are the responsibility of the winner. All costs associated with currency exchange are the sole responsibility of the winner. ALL TAXES AND ANY APPLICABLE WITHHOLDING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CASH WINNER. </p>

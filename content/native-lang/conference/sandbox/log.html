<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]

  My .sxi is here: http://native-lang.openoffice.org/conference/
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I have been travelling around Japan to meet people
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  whom I would like to ask to join, and to discuss with them about vision of NPO, OpenSourcers (tentative name) and our dreams.  
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Becase I think it is very important that NPO founders trust each other.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I have just been back from Tokyo.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  OK, let me start my presentation.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 1:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  My talk will be on Non Profit Organization (NPO) to Support OpenSource Developers
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 2:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  My talk will be short.  I would like to have your advises and comments, more time for Q & A and discussion.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  After my presentation I have questions for you.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Please think about these questions while seeing, listening my presentation.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  My questions are:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What NPO law do you have in your country?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Are you planning to establish an NPO?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Do you know contributors, developers or translators  who need financial or material help?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What do they need, What do they want?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Why are you working for OpenOffice.org the product and the community?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What is your motivation?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Do you think that money can help OpenSource development? :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Here is the Agenda
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Speaker Introductions
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Japan
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  OpenOffice.org Ja Native Language Project
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Japan OpenOffice.org Users Group 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What we really need
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What if we have money
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO Law in Japan
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO Activity
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  and Q & A
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 3:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  My name is Kazunari Hirano.  
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  When I introduce myself with my full name in Japanese, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I say my family name first, and then my given name,
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  so I say, my name is Hirano Kazunari.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We use Chinese Characters. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can't express well without using them.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Chinese Characters are ideogram. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  When we see it, we can imagine what it means. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  In my name you can see a Chinese Character "One," very easy one to understand :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  My name literally means, "Plain Field, One Success."
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 4: Japan
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I made this Japan language map based on information given by:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=JP
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I don't think it's a correct map 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  because their information is old and often incorrect
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  but it's ok, one of the very interesting view on languages in Japan.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I am a member of the OpenOffice.org Japanese Native Language Project,
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I am a Japanese living in Japan.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I am an OpenOffice.org blogger :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  http://openoffice.exblog.jp/
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  There you can see my face :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Japan is often called Japanese archipelago or Japanese islands.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Bigger islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I live in "Ichinoseki" City, "Iwate" Prefecture, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  northern part of Japan Main Island, "Honshu."
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 5:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Japanese Native Language Project
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Ja NLP membership
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  http://ja.openoffice.org/servlets/ProjectMemberList
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We have around 800 observers registered and around 20 developers registered.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We form OpenOffice.org Japan Users Group, core of which is OpenOffice.org Japanese Native Language Project.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  For this group we have 15 managing staffs, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  core of which are OpenOffice.org Japanese Native Language Project members who have signed JCA and have commit rights.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  The Users Group has a users mailing list outside the OpenOffice.org Japanese Native Language Project to embrace as many users as possible,
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  which is openoffce@freeml.com
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  It has Near 3,000 subscribers
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Sure we have Project Mailing Lists:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We use discuss@ja.openoffice.org to discuss about management of the group, marketing, events, and general questions regarding OpenOffice.org
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We use translate@ja.openoffice.org for translation works, translation collaboration with Sun Microsystems, OpenOffice.org translation bug reporting etc.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 6:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  OpenOffice.org Japan Users Group
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  It is just a group.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We don't know who are members.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  It is not a legal entity.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  All activity is based on volunteers.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We don't have accounting function.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can't receive money.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  When we need money or have a chance to receive money, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  we ask an individual, a staff member, to voluntarily open a bank account.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  The group often creates OpenOffice.org CDs and distributes free to people at events and conferences in Japan.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  When we organized the OpenOffice.org Conference Japan 2005,
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  a company wanted to contribute to us.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  A staff member asked a CD manufacturer to press hundreds of OpenOffice.org CDs and pay for them.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  And after the conference, the company donate the amount of money what he paid to his own account.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  This was heavy burden and risk for him.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 7:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What we really need
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We don't want money.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want People
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want Developers
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want Translators
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want Contributors
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want Motivated people
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want to have quality OpenOffice.org
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want to contribute to society
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want Communication
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We want to Help people
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Now do we need Money?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 8:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What if we have money
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We don't work for money. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  But what if we have money:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can get more contributors, developers and translators.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Skilled developers are busy. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can ask developers to share their time.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Tools are needed for development.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can provide them with equipments.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Developers need information and exchange of ideas.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can help them go to conferences.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can do a lot of activity you can imagine :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Marketing activitiy, Organizing activity....
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 9:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO Law in Japan
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  It was enacted on Dec. 1, 1998 and revised on May 1, 2003.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  The revised law simplified the application and grant process.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Under the NPO law, Japanese government grants a volunteer group as a legal entity
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What is benefits to become an NPO, a legal entity
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Can open a bank account as a group
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Can open an office as a group
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Can register its real property as a group
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Can perform other various legal action as a group
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 10:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  The NPO law provides Authorized NPO.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  National Tax Agency grants an Authorized NPO.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  If individuals and organizations donate to the Authorized NPO, they don't have to pay tax for the donation.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  The law provides expansion of tax breaks for donations.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  It facilitates individuals, companies and other organizations to danate to NPOs :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 11:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO requirements
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO must have certain purposes
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  such as promotions for welfare, social education, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  for local community, academic and scientific research, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  for environment, security, human rights, children, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  for information society, economic revitalization, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  for employment, consumer protection, etc.., 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  which benefit general public
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO is like a company
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  A company makes money for profit.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO makes money but not for profit,
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  which means NPO members don't share profit. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Not more than 1/3 of board members get compensation.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO must have at least 3 bord members and 1 auditor.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 12:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NPO should have Business Plan:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  They may be:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]

  developers and translators from OpenSouce communities and other fields.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We will meet them and discuss what they want to do,
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  what they need and what we can do together
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  to develop OpenOffice.org and other OpenSource Software.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We encourage them to work together and provide them with what they need by giving them resources, information, money, etc.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We encourage them to join our activity and dispatch them to the conference by giving them transportation and accomodation.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 14:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I would like to focus on Translation Works.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Translation is essential to Japanese OpenSource Communities.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  to provide developers with information
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  for good communication with world developers
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  to motivate developers to join development works
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  For example: TCM (Test Case Maintenance)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  When 1.9.79 test, Japanese Version TCM registered testers were 3, 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  as TCM test cases was all in English.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Then TCM test cases have been translated in Japanese.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  1.9.95 Japanese Version testers increased to 11.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Japanese Translation facilitates Japanese contributors and developers to join OpenOffice.org activity.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 15:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  What would the NPO like to do in future?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  to help world OpenSource developers
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  to help communication and collaboration between various OpenSource communities and businesses
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  OpenOffice.org Aynu Localization
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  OpenOffice.org Klingon Localization
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Verious localization works
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  ??
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Host OpenOffice.org Conference in Japan
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  and to help all the projects you can imagine.. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  correction: Various localization works
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I would like to add some future projects to the slide.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Under the NPO law, NPO can establish a school.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  So the NPO would make a school to educate OpenSource developers and send them to the society.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  cloph: let us talk about Klingon later :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  So the NPO would make a school to educate OpenSource developers and send them to the society.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  And the NPO can set up a research institute for OpenSource Software, attached to the school.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Slide 16:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Thanks for your attention and Q & A :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  simple questions please :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  So what about klingon? Do you really meant the klingon from the enterprise-series?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  cloph: yes!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  I really wonder who will (or better can) use an Office Suite in klingon... :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  cloph: so let us talk about it later, one reason is that it is fun!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  that's all, and I can think of marketing purpose :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  Thanks, khirano, this was both interesting and familiar because we already have a foundation/NPO that funds OOo work in Norway. Where will the Japanese NPO get money?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  ..But according to german wikipedia it is a registered language! And there even is a wikipedia in klingon :-) but enough about this... Sorry for disturbing/being off-topic :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  khirano: Is this the Q&A now?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  gautehk: the NPO do business and ask companies and local governments,  japanese government to donate.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  khirano: Sounds very familiar (and sensible)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  the NPO publishes magazines and others, and sell them.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  the NPO collect membership fee, also.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  cloph: it's ok.  I want to discuss about it later :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  khirano: who are members? Individuals or large-scale users (companies/organizations/government)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  gautehk: Both
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  they would be members.  they can join the NPO as individuals and organizations.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  And membership fees would vary
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  the NPO can decide the membership fee for individuals and organizations.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Do the NPO members get an allowance for their work?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  the NPO can employ staffs, who would be paid, allowance.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  It could employ developers and documentation writers! :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  DanielC: right!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  I'd like that a lot. I think it would help OOo to have more developers, and in particular, some who aren't tied to any company.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Even if we don't hire people full time, if we just hire a couple of guys part time, that would be something.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Or we could work on commission.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Like, get someone to write SVG import.  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  DanielC: thanks for good ideas
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Yeah, that might work well. Comission would work for a beginning NPO.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  khirano: Is your NPO setup already?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  For comparison, here's briefly what we do: The Norwegian foundation employs part-time translators. It has no membership fee. Some of the board members represent large-scale users.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  NOT YET! 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  SVG-import already exists as a xslt-based solution (at least it was started)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  cloph: Yeah, but it needs work.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  gautehk: You have an NPO already?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  DanielC: yes, for a year or so
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  cool.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Do you now other projects that do too?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  I think I heard that French NL has one.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Don`t you think there will be conflicts of interest if there are developers who are employed and others who are not?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: How so?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour: I am thinking about it too.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  Volunteers do the fun stuff, paid employees do the boring work. (Basically :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  So we will meet developers and ask them whether they want to be supported or not.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  and the NPO will open all the information it has, whom it supports and others
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Germany has such a NPO too... but we have problems to separate between "NPO interests" and "own business interests" of the members
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour:  the NPO will help their communication and understanding
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Its not the problem of the members, more the critical voices you hear in the de-community
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour:  yes, it is.  we have to think about it.  but I think we can solve the question by communication and mutual understanding
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Whats about the ja-community? How does they think about it?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Not all the people among ja-community think that the NPO is the best solution
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Yes, thats right. Communication between community an NPO is very important. It`s very important to have strict rules how to handle with the earned money
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  The present ja-community can not handle money at all.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Do they have alternatives? Or do they think, its not important to handle with money?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  But we know we have to have some measure to handle money and to further develop our works and community
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour: No, they don't have alternatives, I think.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: That`s true... we concentrate on marketing activities at the moment, I don`t think, we can manage it in the next years to employ people
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I think they are OK with present situation to do the same as past.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  But I think we have to do more to keep the community survive and be active.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Actually it is difficult to keep motivation of developers and translators among ja-community.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: How did the qa-community increase in the last two years? Do you know, how many observers and developers you had 2 years before?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahempour: I don't know exactly how many
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  khirano: I can imagine motivation being difficult. OOo is a lot harder to work on than most other open source projects.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  but OpenOffice.org development so far is itself very interesting and we got many users.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  khirano: I guess it's an issue of making it easier for developers who are already interested to not be distracted by "work".
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  khirano: Kind of like what they did for Linus.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  DanielC:  it is true :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  hhmm... maybe this also leads into "who do we hire?"
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  The NPO would hire people who have been working for a while and have shown commitment.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  it is the most important question.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  But that wouldn't address problems like hiring someone to finish SVG import. That is, problems for which no current member can help.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  It's a difficult question. Discussion is good.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We have to meet them and discuss.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  To meet them, we have to travel, we need money :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  If you focus on local developers it might be easier.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Or... you can arrange for "potentials" to go to OOoCon.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Hhmm... I like that idea.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Pick a few people who are good contributors and sponsor them to go to OOoCon.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Then meet them there.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  sounds good.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Even if you don't "hire" them later, you still did something valuable with that money.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  You know what I mean.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  yes, definitely
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  I only see the problem... "who decides it" and how to prevent, that the others not think to get a raw deal
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Magi</span>]
  I've heard that SVG is hard to implement? Possibly it can't be done with XSLT at all.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: I guess that you need some sort of committee. So no one person can choose arbitrarily (or be /seen/ to choose arbitrarily).
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour: You have the OpenOffice.org non profit association in German, right?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: But no matter what you do, someone will always be upset.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Magi: I hear that an "ok" filter is doable, but a "complete" filter is very hard.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Magi: But I don't know.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Yes we have... and we have exact this kind of problems with it
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour: I would like to share knowledge and activity with yours
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: How do you decide right now?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  DanielC: We don`t decide much at the moment. We focus on marketing activities. We pay for things, the members had to pay for theirselves before
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: Ok. That's still a good way to spend the money. You don't *have* to hire people.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  (IMHO)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  We have a "board of directors" (Vorstand), who decides, how to spend the money... we are 3 persons
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  I see.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  DanielC: But its always the problem, not to be inequitable
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: I don't envy your position. No matter what you do, someone will be unhappy.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  But we surely spend money for community members who are not members of the NPO
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  So all one can do is minimize the number of unhappy people.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Perhaps it's safer to "sponsor" people so they spend less money themselves? Like taking them to OOoCon.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  But this is a problem too... we have laws, that we are not allowed to spend too much money for non-members
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: Do you have a lot of complaints over how DE-NL spends money?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  DanielC: Yes, we had terrible discussions about it in the beginning of this year
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-(
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>gautehk</span>]
  (unstable network ...)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  But it was at a time we did not spend much money at all. We were at the beginning of our activities... and it slowed down our motivation...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: May I ask what the money argument was about? Or do you prefer to not discuss it?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>hfischer</span>]
  This is hot stuff.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  let's not get into it then.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  DanielC: No, its ok! But I don`t know the arguments exactly. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>hfischer</span>]
  I for myself can't explain the discussions exactly.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  The main problem with this whole discussion was that it was not arguments that were discussed but personalities.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  cloph: Yes, that`s right
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :(
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  But that's not a fundamental problem with NPO's. That can happen with any kind of decison.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Its a problem to get active people for the work at a NPO... the others mistrusts them and think, they only have personal interests
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  oh
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Trust, it is important.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Yes.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  The only "money" related thing was that there was a sponsered weekend in a hotel (the owner of the hotel sponsored the stay, the members only had to pay for food/drinking). Members of the e.V. had to bay 5 € less. But this really was a very marginal point of the discussion.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>hfischer</span>]
  For me was the foundation of the german NPO not really anchored at the online community. The right communication between a very active group and the online volunteers was missing. So I think. That is my personal opinion, I speak only for my self.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  hfischer: So they felt left out.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>hfischer</span>]
  Yes, I think so.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Ok.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Well... we've learned something. That when you setup an NPO it's important to involve as much of the community as you can.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  And not just do it yourself.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>hfischer</span>]
  DanielC: Yes.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  We didn´t do it ourself in germany. But not all community members noticed it
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Its a difficult topic... involving the community is very important, but you have to make a decision sometime
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>hfischer</span>]
  It is a arduous way to communicate special facts all over the net and through mailinglists. Some people want to get results very quick, but that is not even possible in a online community who could speak together realtime.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  hfischer: it's true.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>AietKolkhi</span>]
  Hello DanielC, Khirano, Helga and  everybody. I am sorry I was not able to join earlier. The topic seemedvery  interesting, so I will have to see the logs I guess :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  We talked about the foundation for more than 2 Years...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  AietKolkhi: Good to see you.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  jrahemipour: That seems like plenty of time...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Of course, I don't know the details.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour:  you started a local foundation actually, it is a good progress.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  we start a NPO in Japan and would get some experience.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Another point is, that the people who are not only working online, spent a lot of money for fairs and so on, so they saw many good reasons 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  We can share our knowledge and many things.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Yes, certainly. Feel free to ask, if you have questions!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  jrahemipour: yes I will :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I am happy to get some good ideas and experience here :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Will you attend the next OOoCon?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  the NPO would start next month
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I hope.  I am writing Business Plan of the NPO now:)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  khirano: Oh, good! Please don`t hesitate to contact us
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I will make another presentation about the NPO's experience.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  That would be very interesting
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  OK, thanks all, I will go to bed now.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  May I see you all at the next OpenOffice.org Conference?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]

   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Ok I'm assuming everyone is now on slide 1
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 1 - The Native American Proverb provides a link to the idea of community participation. Learning through participation is the theme for the INGOTs. Its also very attractive to educationalists and their professional values.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 2 - This is just an index of what is to follow.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 3 - INGOT is an acronym International Grades in Office Technology. It means something in English! - A gold bar full of value ;-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  In German Barren, Dutch BAAR, Spansh LINGOTE, French LINGOT, Portuese INGOT, Italian INGOT, so very similar in quite a few languages. I hope it doesn't have some bad meaning in any language I haven't found yet :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Note that INGOT certificates are independent of any particular software in terms of the skills required. They are only dependent on the OpenOffice.org community insofar as the community service aspects are concerned. But more of that later.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 4 - Bill Gates wants a Windows computer on every desk. I want everyone on the planet to have at least one INGOT certificate. If there was a dollar revenue from everyone on the planet we would have plenty of money for OOo development, probably all the development on generic FLOSS applications. Ambitious perhaps, but if you don't try you don't succeed!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Teaching children about FLOSS and how to take part in projects will guarantee the next generation of contributors. They can also be productive while they learn. This provides us with more human resource and motivates the children because their work can be recognised and is genuinely useful to others.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 5 - We do not have a lot of capital to invest so we need methods which do not take a lot of time initially but can grow easily across the world. While it would not be difficult to get Venture Capital, VCs would want to grow the business then sell it. We need to keep control to ensure that substantial parts of the revenue go into Open Source development and furthering the OpenOffice.org cause. Non-profits also cause problems and as a small business we get s
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  ome support from the British Chambers of Commerce to support export development.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 6 - The INGOT website is at www.theINGOTs.org. So are INGOTs just another IT couse and exam? Let's see.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 7 - The first INGOT I designed was the Bronze. It was easy to do and will be the certificate done by the most people. Its very simple but a lot of thought has gone into making it simple. We want to make it as easy as possible to take part. We want everyone to be able to do it.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 8 - The criteria are practical and lend themselves to be accredited by direct observation. Operating a computer is a practical activity. It might be convenient to have a written test about operating a computer but would it be valid? It would certainly bey bureaucratically expensive.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 9 - The criteria are there to be shared with the students. There is no secret about them. We want students and teachers to discuss them, to develop their language and communication skills, to learn through this interaction. This is education, not training.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 10 - The certificates build progressively on each other. We give rewards for early success to motivate the student. We tell the student what she needs to do to be successful and we provide practically useful outcomes from the learning to further motivate the student.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 11 - We make the learning process contribute directly to our project.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 12 - We accredit good practice that should already be there but often is not. Most children will have to build a simple web site as part of their school studies at some time, but here in the UK nothing is said about using appropriate tools or testing for compliance with standards. At this point we don't need to be too rigorous but we can flag up the principle. "You should not try and use MS Word for everything"
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 13 - I hope you can see that although simple, there is a lot of good education pedagogy in the INGOT certification. Ok, onto Gold 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 14 - A unique requirement of the Gold INGOT over all other certificates is the requirement to participate in an Open Source project.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 15 - At this level it probably won't be contributing code although there is no exclusion of this. There are plenty of things to do without the need for coding.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 16-18 - This series is an example of how a pupil contributed a useful teaching resource for maths in OOo Impress. Most schools in the UK use data projectors now so it makes sense to provide those things that used to be written in chalk as professional presentations and make these available for home use using free software and creative commons licensing. We can structure and organise these resources on the INGOT website using the work of the students and so
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  me funding from the certificate fees. We then will have a sustainable and ever growing bank of free educational resources that run on Open Source software.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 19 - We can povide support for students using mailing lists. This teaches them how to participate and takes pressure off hard-prerssed teachers. We also have a discussion forum on the web site.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 20 - By popular demand from primary schools we have just developed My First INGOT and the concept of Otto's club for 5-7 year olds.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 21 - To administer the certification we use the web site with a database to store the names of certificated students and each certificate has a unique number and entry against which it can be authenticated. INGOT assessors are all trained by an assessor trainer and I have personally trained all the assessor trainers travelling around the world to do it.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 22 - Ok, not everything is FREE as in beer. If you want an official certificate you have to pay a few dollars. We will soon have a system on the website so that assessors can buy certificate credits through paypal or a similar mechanism. They can then award certificates to suitably capable students. By keeping the costs low and getting large take up all over the world we hope to generate substantial sums to put back into development.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 23 - We only launched properly in September after some pilots. Considering the lack of resources and the fact that I have to do this development alongside other work, I'm very encouraged by the rate of progress. We already have Polish, translation and some Romanian with promises of Spanish. Obviously things have gone quicker in the UK because I know the system here better and I can exploit particular initiatives. A solid basis in the UK can help finance de
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  velopment further afield.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Ok, that#s it. I hope I got the pace OK for everyone - questions?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Very good timing Ian.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  great
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>lgodard</span>]
  clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  APPLAUSE!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#854; font-weight:900'>simonbr</span>]
  applause
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  APPLAUSE
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  applause
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>brko</span>]
  interesting....
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Bows modestly
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a73; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  thanks, ian!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  heh
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Agerskov</span>]
  Great presentation
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>lgodard</span>]
  Great work
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Now we are in the Question and Answer period.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  good I got some:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  Q: A major flaws of the computer courses is that they want to push the application as the solution ot all challenges. For example, using a spreadsheet to create a website, or code on a word processor instead of a text editor. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Yes using the right tool for the job is an important INGOT theme
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  But we often have to teach teachers as they don't know any better
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  So we start gently
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Anyone else? :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#458; font-weight:900'>pseudo_daoist</span>]
  Q: For the web page creation project  do they have to use an HTML editor? Can they use a regular text editor  (VI, EMACS, VDE)  with the appropriate HTML tags?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Agerskov</span>]
  When designing a website with 5 pages you tell that open standards are importent and then you tell them to test the site with 3 browsers - why not http://validator.w3.org ?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Why is the service requirement on for OOo. Shouldn't it be for any free Office suite or any free program?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Agerskov</span>]
  Peschtra: I second that
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  They can use anything appropriate. Its probably simpler to say we don't accept MS Pubkisher because that is probably the most common bad practice we come across
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  I think MS Word is an equaly bad HTML editor.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Why not make them use HTML in notepad or somthing?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  These are beginners starting from scratch. We want them to understand the principle that more than one web browser needs to be supported . We will scare off the teachers if we make it too complex too early
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>lgodard</span>]
  Agerskov: validator is great, but the aim of three different browsers is to know alternatives
<br />
   [<span style='color:#854; font-weight:900'>simonbr</span>]
  Does INGOT prescribe or suggest certain teaching materials?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  In practice we would accept a student working on say Mozilla, but since I need to support them and I am on OOo its easier to be specific
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Agerskov</span>]
  ianL: I would suggest two browsers and W3C's validator
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Is that in reference to my question about which project to volunteer for?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  where did the spreadsheet gets introduced in the INGOT
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  No INGOTs is an accreditation frame work not a course. This is deliberate. If you try to force new courses into an over-crowded curriciculum you will fail
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  We keep things as open and as inclusive as possible to maximise our client group
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  We will be creating support materials but these will always be optional
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  ianL: Can you tell us what you are going to do in Prague in detail, how long will you stay there to do it?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Spreadsheets come in Silver
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Can you come to Japan and do the same?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>brko</span>]
  I think that this is a great idea.... I work for a company (steel industry), which has switched to OpenSource few years ago. And one of the big problems is, that when we employ a new person directly form school, the only thing the know is Microsoft and usually they are supprised, that something else exists. In case this certificate would be obtainable here in Slovakia I would definatelly put it on the requirement list for job application in our company.....
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Is slide 20 the bronze requirements?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#854; font-weight:900'>simonbr</span>]
  Are there guidelines about what sort of software and materials can be used to attain a certain certificate?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>lgodard</span>]
  Is there some system that alloows to say that is silver/gold at on place/time is the same at another ? Does it make sense ?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  I think also this is a great program for senior citizens, handicap resources 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I will be in Prague from tomorrow evening to the following day. I am relying on Robert to direct the time. Main objective is to train Robert as an assessor trainer but this doesn't take long so we will also enjoy Prague :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>artietee</span>]
  ianL: Is INGOTs comming to The Netherlands soon ?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>artietee</span>]
  ianL: Are you?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Slide 20 is below bronze. Its for the little kids. You can download the handbook with all the specifications from www.theINGOTs.org. All CC license
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  ianL:  how many organizations got in the USA?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#548; font-weight:900'>technomajian</span>]
  Have any other open source projects, such as Mozilla, indicated an interest in contributing to or participating with INGOT?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  No guidelines on software apart form it should be appropriate eg not Publisher for web sites. We want to get to the die hard MS users so let them take part using MS Office. They will have to also install OOo for educational reasons ;-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I haven't approached other projects - LPI are interested in cooperating with a Platinum INGOT. Its really time I'm short of!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Who is "supposed" to pay the fee, the students or the school?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Yes we have got interest from Adult education. I was a bit surprised but some people see this as a far better framework than ECDL/ICDL. Its certainly less expensive and more flexible
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  ianL: how did you get supports or subsidy from british government?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Fee payment will depend on the locality, clients etc. In the UK the schools pay. I have also arranged it so that schools can use grants that are normally targeted at proprietary software ;-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I am encouraging people to set up small businesses to teach basic IT skills and charge for their time. The certificate fee is then negligible compared to the teacher's costs
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  I was just thinking, this could incorporated into the normal teaching of most schools' business classes, but the fee may be prohibitive.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  It would be nice though, because this is the kind of thing that might look good on a college app for someone entering into a computer/business field.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  INGOTs will come to the Netherlands or indeed any country when someone says they are interested in being trained. I will come at no expense to the host country and do the training. I was in Slovenia with Urska to-day. Czech Republic with Robert tomorrow
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>artietee</span>]
  ianL: Thanks for your well prepared talk
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  INGOTs are designed to be incorporated with existing courses. We are flexible on prices. We can vary that to suit the local economy. I have just used prices that I know UK schools are prepared to pay. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>artietee</span>]
  everybody: bye
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  What is 2 pounds in Dollars roughly
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  $4
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  ianL: so if you train others in this country, then there is no need for you to go back to that country?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  unless the trainer can't for any reason.. I guess
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  How long would you for see it being before an INGOT certificate was recognized as an "accomplishment" by unviersities and such when applying to college?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  In prionciple I train assessor trainers who are then able to train other assessors. This is out quality control and we need it as I will later approach the UK exam authorities for official recognition
<br />
   [<span style='color:#458; font-weight:900'>pseudo_daoist</span>]
  Q: Are you still desiging the Platinium  level?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Haven't started with Platinum simply because of time but we have Birmingham University CS department involved and possibly LPI. Its less urgent because it will affect fewer people.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  ianL pseudo_daoist : any outline on what Platium will intend to achieve?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>Jzarecta</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Programming contribution
<br />
   [<span style='color:#458; font-weight:900'>pseudo_daoist</span>]
  thanks
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I don't want people to get too hung up on costs. To start with everyone can do some certification free to try things out. We need an income though for development so we have to charge something.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Agerskov</span>]
  Could FLOSS participation also be error reporting?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Of course
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Anythng that is useful to a FLOSS project 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Help on the OOo Users list
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  That would be a good way to learn
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  How can I introduce INGOT to Japanese people, translation of INGOT website into Japanese?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I welcome anyone who can do translation. We can come to an arrangement where if someone does the translation, we will give free certification credits in return
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Start small, build incrementally from grass roots. This is the bazaar, not the cathedral
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Did you mention alreayd where the funding is currently coming from? You are doing a lot of travel.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  My company and the UK government
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  cool
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  This is why we have to make it sustainable by having a business model to generate income. I have a lot of contacts and influence in UK education so its easy for me here but that also provides us with a platform for international development
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I seriously believe we can earn enough income to provide all the resource needs of the OOo project and more. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Agerskov</span>]
  Leaving
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  This makes us a lot less dependent on Sun which I thnk most people believe is desirable
<br />

  good talk ianL 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  Thank you, Ian. I'm sorry I was late. I'm looking forward to getting the IRC log so I can read what you said before I arrived.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  If anyone wants to be trained as an assessor just contact me by private E-mail
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Think you have heard most of it before! :-)
<br />

  Doesn't one need to know how to do everythin that the Gold or Silver Level requires, before applying tobe an assesor?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  True, but in bits and pieces, not all organised with slides -- I didn't see your presentation in San Diego.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#548; font-weight:900'>technomajian</span>]
  Well, I need to run as well.  ianL, a wonderful talk!  I look forward to hearing more about INGOT.  Keep us informed, and again, thank you for your hard work!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  technomajian: Thank you for comming :-)

   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  You can become a Bronze or Silver Assessor trainer. Yes you would have to know whow to do the things but in general I think anyone capable of IRC would find Bronze easy
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  I think a big problem tha tthe program faces is the mindset that schools need to teach the students MS or else they won't be ready for life. I guess INGOTs incorporates that, but what plans do you have to soften people towards accepting FLOSS and OOo?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  That is part of the strategy. You can do Bronze on MS Office. No worries. But for Silver you need to burn an OOo CD and for Gold you need 25 hours community service. We take out the emotiveness of the technology politics. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  What does that last sentence mean? emotiveness?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  INGOTs educate people about FLOSS and OOo. Let them then decide after they are educated
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Emotion taking over from rationality. We can't immediately kill emotion so lets not try. Lets do it gentler and from a starting point everyone can accept
<br />
   [<span style='color:#458; font-weight:900'>pseudo_daoist</span>]
  ing
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#854; font-weight:900'>simonbr</span>]
  Thanks Ian, bye
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  A key feature of the INGOTs is to lower the barrier to entry for even the most relucant. A lot of thought has gone into this aspect and it fits Christensen's disruptive technology theories
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  makes sense
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  Its why the criteria are kept as simple as possible but guiding the main ideas of freedom. These are difficult concepts for the uninitiated.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>Peschtra</span>]
  Yeah, there were for me. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I think we too often try to take too big steps with people who are not ready to take them. Some people are but most aren't
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  IanL: I agree on that!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  INGOTs -----> OOo-------->Linux
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  And let's take some money of MS users to develop FLOSS :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  Need to do things(and introduce ideas) in ways that have meaning for people when they are doing them.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  yeah!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  Yes!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  it is important to get as many people as possible touch an idea of FLOSS.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  yeah!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  I like irony, I'm a Brit ;-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  If you think education is expensive, try ignorance :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  heh
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>jeanw</span>]
  indeed
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>ianL</span>]
  khirano, I have always wanted to visit Japan so we need to work out a way of getting INGOTs in to Japan. I have had an interest in Japanese culture ever since studying Judo :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  ianL: sure, let us think about it :)

   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  the title, as you must have noticed already is The Adriatic Experience
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  ....for the OOoCon05
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  why Adriatic?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  that's what our sea is called.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  so: slide 1
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  here, you can see that this year's conference will be organized by the slovenian and the italian OOo teams
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  together
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 2
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  today's topics
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  as you can see on slide 2, i will say something about the organizers, location, OOo in slovenia and italy, and, of course, about the conference program.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  let's keep moving on...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 3: the organizers
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  that would be the OOo teams i have already told you about
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  both have already done some great things for OOo
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  localization, implementation, support...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  both have also wanted to arrange some kind of a meeting for a long time, but have just gotten the chance to do it this year
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  with OOoCon05
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  this is a good time to thank all of you who voted for koper, by the way. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  ;)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  no problem :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  moving on to slide 4...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 4: locations
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  for the location we chose immediate town center of Koper-Capodistria, because we wanted to give a different feel to the whole event. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  usually, conferences are held in boring conference rooms and centers, so we decided to lighten the thing up by using rooms from the theater, a gallery and similar
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-D
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  these rooms are still  presentation rooms, already used for conferences, except they have an ocean view. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  Sounds good and interesting...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and some artwork
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-D
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  eskroni: the rooms or the ocean view?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  both :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 5: a map of slovenia, italy and koper
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Nice map!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (created by our very own danielC)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  Daniel, are you "fishing for compliments"?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  there are plenty of other maps, but this one was done in OOo Draw, so...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  as you can see in this nice map, Koper is situated in the coastal region of Slovenia, next to the border with Italy. Trieste, Venice and other beautiful sights are just 0.5 to 1 hour away. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  note: bobe has warned me about the map missing corsica, sardinia and sicily. i hope noone will be offended by this. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  how do you like it so far?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  cosa nostra, if noone else :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and now to the conference things:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (i mean the official conference things)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 6: the program-wednesday
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  as you all know, OOoCon05 is listed for 28.9.-30.9. (3 days alltogether)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  but:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  wednesday will be focused on the community and preparations for the next two days. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  right now, the plan is to keep these events semi-closed ...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  ...which means that only community members would attend the afternoon and evening event.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (by community members we mean all people involved in the project)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  so: wednesday is officially the start of the conference, but there will be no presentations and official conference program yet
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  this is important for those, who don't know when to book a flight or reserve a room
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  if you are coming for the conference itself, you can come on thursday.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  that's all on wednesday.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 7:  program for thursday
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  general topics will be covered on thursday and friday. this will include all of the topics mentioned, and others that will not fit into any other category but might be interesting.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  thursday will also be focused on the development of OOo, since we expect many developers and OOo experts in Koper¸
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  we hope to have the privilage of having pavel janik as a guest speaker, since he has done much for the slovenian OOo builds (amongst others)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  the public administration and enterprises topic will cover presentations of large implementations and uses of OOo in government establishments and enterprises.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  his will be of interest to those who are thinking of migrating but are not yet sure of how it works.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  his>this
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  this part will also include case-studies of using OOo in different production environments
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  so that's thursday
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 8:  friday's program
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  besides general topics, this day will also focus on XML technology on the one hand and integrating and using OOo in schools on the other
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (hi pperez)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  we hope to get many on-hands presentations and workshops here, by people directly involved in the educational process
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  for one, ian lynch (the INGOTS lead) has already confirmed his involvement, which makes us very happy :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  that's all on the conf program. the topics have been roughly defined, variations will be possible
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  but that's basically most of it
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  at this point I would also like to invite everyone who believes he/she has anything (nice) to say about OOo on any of the topics, to send their paper
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  ...and have a presentation
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  now, to the leisure activities :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 9: additional activities
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  besides the official conference program, conference atendees will also be able to do many other things
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  since this is one of the best wine regions in the world (ok, i'm really not being modest here :) 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  we will try to arrange something like a wine-tasting party or a visit to a wine cellar
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  yey!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  i thought you'll like that
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  hi louis_h
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  koper is a tourist-focused town, so there are numerous things to do, especially in the summer
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>louis_h</span>]
  hi all
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  some will probably want to visit Trieste or Venice in Italy, or any other slovenian or italian tourist attractions
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>louis_h</span>]
  ursacol02: you have probably discussed--yes?--but any good tips how to get there?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>louis_h</span>]
  esp. coming from, say, north america
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  yes, i have some. I thought we would discuss about this later, too. i get a lot of questions like that.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  depends on where exactly you are coming from and which day you are arriving
<br />
   [<span style='color:#5a0; font-weight:900'>louis_h</span>]
  k
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  ?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  kansas?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  k = ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  sorry :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  oh, right
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  anyway, about the additional activities I was talking about...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  before the conference, on wednesday, we are planning a community get-together in the evening :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (hope to see you all there already)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  what will happen there? Do you have some ideas?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  just ideas. just a casual meeting of folks who keep running into each other on mailing lists and IRC chats, but have never met before.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  this was actually davide's idea. he said he was planning on doing this for a long time (for the italian OOo team), but never had the time to go through it.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  so we thought it might be a nice idea to meet people around music and drinks (not too much)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Andre_S</span>]
  this is always a good idea
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  i agree
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  as I said, this will be totally casual.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  well, back to the slides.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  slide 10: OOo in Italy and Slovenia
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  here you can see that OOo in slovenia and italy has already had some success (awards, integrations...)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bottom line: government, enterprises and home users know about it, have at least tried it and most of them have it on their computer
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  i guess this is pretty good.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  for OOo
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (for such a small country)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  on slide 11 you have our contacts (urska and robert from the slovenian OOo team and davide from the italian)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  all info on the conference will also be available on the website
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and on the last slide...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (is it over yet? but i have so much more to say :) )
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  this slide says it all. if you wish to participate in any way, you are welcome to do so
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Andre_S</span>]
  So .. just tell ,-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  we will be happy to simply have you as a visitor, but if you feel the need to dispose of some financial assets, too, we won't stop you either :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  well, i guess that's it.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  from me
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  clap clap clap clap clap
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  thank you
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  clap clap clap clap clap
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Andre_S</span>]
  Thanks for you presentation :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  (deep bow)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Thank you Urska.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a73; font-weight:900'>pperez333</span>]
  thank you for your speech
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  now to your questions
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  you're welcome
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Andre_S</span>]
  For the financial assets: who should be contacted?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  first off, the confsponsor mailing list
<br />
   [<span style='color:#800; font-weight:900'>Andre_S</span>]
  (ok, just seen the sponsorship link)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  Where can we find info about motels, prices :) Not very expensive.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  that's confsponsor@marketing.openoffice.org
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  IcoBgr: i'm putting together Travel&Accommodation.html, which will be on web site ASAP
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  first, try looking for 'koper hotel' on google. that will throw out some nice links
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  with some useful tips
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  all the relevant links are in the list
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  but if you need anything specific, you can ask off-list
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  I have a question :)  are you planning "home stay" or can you think of "home stay" project?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  right. and all the info will also be on the website
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  first, i would like to save money for accomodation :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  khirano: what do you mean by home stay?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  and i prefer "home stay" to "hotel stay" :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Staying at someone's place instead of a hotel?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  oh, right
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  for example, i stay your home, may I?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  only Davide is from Koper
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  the closest you get to home stay in slovenia is by staying at a pension
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  right.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  We can all go to Davide's house  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Good idea :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  Good idea :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  yap
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  All the others are 100 km or more away so we'll be all staying in some hotel/hostel
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  great idea. they have nice wine there.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-)) Davide will be happy
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: will you tell him or should I?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  What about youth hostels - are there some nearby?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  yes, there is one in koper, but we're still arranging a meeting with them.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  to see if they can offer any discounts.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  ursacol02: i leave this nice job to you ;-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: thanks, you are so kind :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: the same goes for hotels in koper and vicinity. there might be some discounts for you.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  youth hostels: there is one in the (Urska, help me with translation of "dijaski dom", please :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  but is full because Eaptember is a time when school starts.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  September
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  One bad thing about youth hostes is that they often have curfew hours...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  dijaski dom=dorm, student board
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: why? do you plan to stay out longer?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  cloph: but you didn't have to care about, when you registered and have your own key...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  about accomodations: we will try to find the best possible deals for visitors
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>stx12</span>]
  ursacol02, bobe: so what can we do to help you? spread the word (CfP), answer people's questions at ooocon2005_discuss@marketing? what else?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  Only /if/ you have your own key...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  stx12: the most important thing IMO is that we get the word out. the more people we can expect at the conference, the more discounts hotels will be ready to give us. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  Too bad that school starts, otherwise we could all have stayed in a sports hall :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02: And the more fun the conf will be...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  stx12: you can also try to attract sponsors :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  stx12: help us find some sponsors - how are things arround big companies going?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :) bobe and I are on the same level here.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-) money money
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  stx12: great! :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: or, even better, why don't we all just party all night long and not go to sleep at all?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  yeah!
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  you wouldn't need a key then
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  good experience :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  Yeah -thought of this as well - let the beach be our realm....
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  or money for accomodation
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>stx12</span>]
  what will the police say if we sleep at the beach?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  oh, they won't mind. teenagers do it all the time.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  it might get cold at night, though.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02: Define "cold".
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  can we have fire there? :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  You do not feel your legs and arms :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  well, look at it this way. in summer, daytime temperatures rise up to 35 degrees (C). at night, they fall to 20 degrees
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  stx12: well, if you mean to bring a tend with you and pay in a camp, no problem. but sleeping on the beach will call the cops, that's a sure thing
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  so that's not cold really, it's chilly
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02: 20 C is very nice.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#50a; font-weight:900'>jrahemipour</span>]
  Thats enough for us :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and you still feel your arms and legs
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Koper sounds great.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  oh, right. there are also some nice camps nearby.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  do you do tents and camps? they are pretty cheap
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  That's an idea.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Tents are fun.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  DanielC: koper is great.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  we'll visit all (well, most) of hotels, hostels... and try to arrange some discounts for OooCon folks.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  I do not know how is in Slovenia now but if September is like June in Bulgaria, It will not be very nice :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and if you have the tent, more of you can stay together.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and you only pay for one tent
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  How much do the camp sites cost?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  let me check
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>stx12</span>]
  bobe: do you have a timeframe for your hotel check trip in mind? 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  http://www.teni.si/adria/pricelist.htm
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  stx12: not yet. we must visit them and a Mayor and restaurants (them too about discounts, special offers...) - we'll tell ASAP
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>stx12</span>]
  thx
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe is right. as soon as we know anything more, we will post it on the website. besides, the website is not yet finished, so there is much more info to be added.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a37; font-weight:900'>stx12</span>]
  ursacol02: would you recommend the camp we have your link for?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Camp sites seem more affordable.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  Camp Adria Ankaran is 10 km away so you need some kind of transportation
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  yes, the camp is pretty nice. it has been renovated
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  even though the website is not much
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  8.75 EUR per day.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  Urska, how are things about "transportation-sponsor" going on?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  if we get a big car for use on ooocon (and a driver, who will not drink :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: they are interested. they just need some kind of info on how many people to expect.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: do you know a driver in slovenia who will not drink? :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  he he
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  ah, ok - so - how many of you on here would stay in camp?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  ha ha ha
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  I'll no drink :) But I do not have drive license :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  I'm interested in staying on the camp. 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: don't worry. i already have a driver
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  Camp sounds interesting.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  but i can't promise he won't drink
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-))
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  who is your driver?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  One other question: Do I need an international driving license in slovenia? Or is my german driving license enough?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  If I can get some course for driving license can I use it in Slovenia? :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  german would be ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  DanielC: a friend. with lots of driving experience.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  (or any other, i guess)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ok
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  OK :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  eskroni: don't know, but i can check. i think german would be ok.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  eskroni: Remind me to tell Agnes about the camp.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  OK, I'll do that. :) 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  IcoBgr: you can try, but our police is not famous for being nice :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  DanielC: i'll put info about camps on wesite too.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  Did you read "hot shower is charged separately" :-) Thank god I got used to cold showers during military service ;-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  bobe: Thanks.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  Camp! +1 :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: that must be a joke, right? who has ever heard of hot showers being charged separately?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  one more idea.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  Why, I cann't use Bulgarian driving license in Slovenia?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  No, I know from other camp sites, that hot showers are charged separately. I don't think it's a joke... 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  I once was on a sailing trip in denmark, showers only worked with coins.. the hot water stopped after a while - cold water did continue
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  IcoBgr: You can't?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  nearby is a "Youth culture club" - terrible translation - wait, i'll check for website...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  IcoBgr: well, you probably can. i misunderstood: i thought you said you would get some kind of a license, not a driver's license.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: the translation is awful, but at least it's funny.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  I'm planig to go to a driving cource soon :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  i like the Consume of electric current translation
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  ursacol02: :-) ok, help me with this one: http://kid-pina.si/~mkc/klarinet/
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  IcoBgr: i can't believe you don't have it yet. in slovenia, everyone has the license when they are 18
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  3,-€ for electricity seem much too me...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  ursacol02: I never have the time to get cource or money :). But most of all time :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02: In Canada everyone has a "learner's license" when they are 16. You can drive, but only with an adult.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: what is the site about?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#008; font-weight:900'>IcoBgr</span>]
  ursacol02: But after the childe birth I have to get one :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  :-) it's a homepage of MKC (Mladinski kulturni center), Marko Brecelj and Ariana.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  DanielC: that would be a bad idea in slovenia. at 16, anyone drives anyway, without the license. this would only make it legal. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: aja
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02: Slovenia reminds me of Venezuela. My mom taught me how to drive when I was 11.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  IcoBgr: i should say so. i can't imagine not having a drivers license right now or if i had children.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02: (but I only drove in "safe" places with her on the passenger seat).
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: 3 EUR is much, but electricity is quite expensive in slovenia
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  DanielC: so did my brother, but that didn't stop him from wrecking the car. :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  i was just talking to Andraz (cyberpipe.org) who would help us organize ooocon
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  ursacol02:  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: what did he say?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  cyberpipe can stream some talks, take care of photos (for ooocon)...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  help to prepare evening evend on thursday (some DJs...)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#a73; font-weight:900'>pperez333</span>]
  i have found a couple of links about slovenia: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/europe/slovenia/index.htm && http://www.slovenia-tourism.si/intro/
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  Just saw another  (unfortunate) thing: "campsite is open from 25.04. till 30.09." So they'll probably kick us out. No way to stay longer there..
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  good resource.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  and if these would be in the MKC, they could offer some VERY cheap sleep.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  i especially like the 'naturally good looking' part
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  BUT it's not a hotel/hostel - you would need a sleeping bag.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  cloph: but you can get there earlier...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: i guess that would do for some visitors.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  bobe: you also need a sleeping bag, when you stay at the camp...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: i don't think they would kick you out. we might make a deal with them.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#808; font-weight:900'>cloph</span>]
  eskroni: I'm a poor student - I don't know for how long my money lasts.. :-/
<br />
   [<span style='color:#880; font-weight:900'>eskroni</span>]
  I'm also a poor (unemployed) student too...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  eskroni: right :-) to be honest, i didn't think about camps till today.

  cloph: as a student, you might get some cheap rooms at the student dorm in koper. they only offer them to students.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  cloph: but you'll need an international student ID for tha.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  for that.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  it would be nice if you have a student card with you.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]

<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe wouldn't be too happy about this, obviously.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]

<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  if we'll manage to arrange all we have in our heads (and what is still comming in)...
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]

<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]

<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  good - it's getting late and i'm looking on my left eye only.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: you're that optimistic and you're only using one eye? 
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  all: did you get some feeling about ooocon? any more questions?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]

<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  :)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]

  louis_h asked something about coming to koper from north america
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  louis_h: are you still here?
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  DanielC: me too
<br />
   [<span style='color:#080; font-weight:900'>DanielC</span>]
  :-)
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  one idea about coming to koper:
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  if you're coming by plane to europe, you can check who else from that city is going to koper.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  and you can drive together from austria or germany, for instance.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#088; font-weight:900'>bobe</span>]
  all: see you arround. it was nice talking to you.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  bobe: good night.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#05a; font-weight:900'>khirano</span>]
  ursacol02: I know one: swimming :)  the sea is one.
<br />
   [<span style='color:#37a; font-weight:900'>ursacol02</span>]
  by stx12, see you around

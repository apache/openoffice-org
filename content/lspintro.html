<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My overall title is Community Development Manager, which is shortened to &quot;Community
  Manager.&quot; It's
  a term that includes strategy planning, project management, political and technical
  coordination, business development, and marketing. Plus a lot of other stuff
  too tedious to bear mention. Periodically, I write articles on open source
  and OpenOffice.org, and I present on OpenOffice.org and open source at major
conferences. Previously, I was employed by Sun Microsystems and then Oracle.</p>
<p>My contact aliases:  <a href="mailto: louis@openoffice.org">louis@openoffice.org</a>.</p>

<p> In addition to my work on OpenOffice.org, I also consult on setting up open-source
  and other collaborative communities and on strategizing open-source projects.
  Meanwhile, I continue, on my own time, to write and present articles and papers
  on US culture from the Postbellum period through the present (I received a
  PhD in English from U.C. Berkeley), though recently I've been broadening the
  scope of my analyses to include the problematics of "infonomics," or the political
  economy of information. Some of my publications and conference papers can be
  found on my more or less defunct <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/luispo/">homepage</a>.
  One of my <a href="http://ooo-speak.blogspot.com/">blogs</a> touches on OpenOffice.org
  and open source; <a href="http://offpress.blogspot.com/">another</a> on cultural
  criticism. A <a href="http://luispo.wordpress.com/">third</a> is on WordPress,
  and works through the news. All of my blogs and public comments represent my
  own views and not any prior or current employer's. I welcome comments, critique,
  even support,
  and encourage all to contribute to the community.</p>

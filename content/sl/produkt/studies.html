<h3>Firm Deploys OpenOffice - Where It Makes Sense</h3>
<p>With open-source productivity suites getting better and
better, the cost of
Microsoft Corp.'s Office is looking higher and higher to FN
Manufacturing LLC. FN Manufacturing began
testing OpenOffice.org 1.1.1 in 2004 with the hope of mitigating the
costsassociated with an enterprisewide upgrade to Microsoft Office
2003. FN
Manufacturing's goal was not necessarily to entirely replace
Microsoft's Office suite, but to find and deploy a more cost-effective
office solution where and when possible.</p>

<h3> Moving to an OpenOffice Culture</h3>
<p>OpenOffice offers the entire organization immediate savings.
Now that's something everyone can understand. Even with the moderate
costs
associated with training and support for a new application, Novell
calculated it could achieve seven-figure savings just by cutting back
on its MS Office licenses as it also streamlined its Windows contracts.
Adopting OpenOffice for Windows, with an eye to eventually going all
the way with Linux, made that possible.

5000 users to OpenOffice.org

Office software subs well for costly version</a> By Al Fasoldt
Sunday, February 19, 2006 <b>Syracuse Post Standard</b>
<cite>I've been using a free alternative to Office for many
years, through a number of revisions.
The latest version, called OpenOffice, is exceptional in some ways.
Considering the price, it's downright outstanding

</a>By Nick Francesco - February 19, 2006 <b>Rochester

<cite>Open Office (or, as they prefer, OpenOffice.org) is a
complete
office suite, much like the more familiar Microsoft Office. For those
of you
who are familiar with Microsoft Office, you'll feel right at home with
OpenOffice.org ... Give OpenOffice.org a try. It's free and you can
have it loaded on the same
computer at the same time as Microsoft Office.

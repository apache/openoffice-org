<H1><A NAME="dba_dev_projects"></A>Developer Projects</H1>
<P>Below is a list of projects which could be implemented by
interested developers. Most of these projects are relatively
self-contained, and do not require too much knowledge about OOo's
code infrastructure.</P>
<P>Note that this list doesn't claim to be a complete repository of
what will be done in the near/medium future. There may be items on
the list which will never be realized, and there definately are items
which are not on the list, but will be implemented.</P>
<P>If you are interested in anything from the list, please speak at
<A HREF="mailto:dev@graphics.openoffice.org">dev@graphics.openoffice.org.</A>
We'll gladly help you to get started on this.</P>
<P>Also, make sure you don't miss <A HREF="http://development.openoffice.org/todo.html">OpenOffice.org's
global TODO list</A>, which also contains interesting projects for
developers.</P>
<H3>General Notes</H3>
<P>Whenever we talk about user interface work, this implies working
with VCL, the Visual Class Library in OpenOffice.org. If you are not
familar with it, you will curse it, since especially some of the
older parts never heard the word &quot;documentation&quot;. On the
other hand: In opposite to the native platform controls, everything
is there as source code, so if you like &quot;learning by debugging&quot;,
you will love VCL 
<IMG SRC="../images/smile.gif" NAME="Grafik1" ALT="smile" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=19 BORDER=0>.</P>
<P>Additionally, be aware of the fact that feature implementations in
OpenOffice.org require a specification (you may visit <A HREF="http://specs.openoffice.org/">the
specifications project</A> for more information). There's a rule that
nothing is checked into the master branch which doesn't have a
specification which all stakeholders agreed upon - so unlike other
open source projects you may know, the specification really is an
important part. Stakeholders are: the documentation team, the user
experience team, the quality assurance team, and development.
Usually, one representative from every team needs to accept your
specification.</P>
<P>Well, don't let this hinder you in starting. Just be aware that
there will be a time when a specification is finally needed. Most
developers don't like writing such documents (and some people even
claim that <A HREF="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000034.html">they
shouldn't</A>). Thus, you need to clarify who will take this for you,
if you can't/don't want.</P>
<P>A note about the effort: This is a rather rough guess at the
moment. In general, it may be a good idea to add two or more weeks or
so simply for becoming familar with the code and some concepts, so if
it is &quot;2 weeks&quot;, don't expect to start today and finish it
in 14 days ...</P>

<H2 CLASS="ueberschrift-western">Creating a Visio filter for OOo Draw</H2>
<P>OOo currently lacks support for a Visio import filter, so that it

<H2 CLASS="ueberschrift-western">Creating an OrgChart component</H2>
<P>Currently, the OpenOffice.org package does not have a tool to
allow users to easily create and manipulate organizational charts. 
OpenOffice.org's main competitor, the Microsoft Office suite, does
provide such a capability for its users. Therefore the addition of
such a tool to OpenOffice.org will help.</P>
<P>OpenOffice.org to attract new users and retain current users. The
user will be able to create org charts using a library of pre-defined
objects.  These objects will support multiple user-definable fields.
Objects will be manipulated using a drag-and-drop interface.  An
auto-alignment function will allow the user to place objects easily.

<H2 CLASS="western">Creating a MultiPage-Tiff importer</H2>
<P>MultiPage-Tiff files are oftenly generated from FAX documents and

herself, or to just embed it into the final document.</P>
<P>The current TIFF filter is able to import such files. We now need
to ask the user what the destination for his Multipage TIFF file

<H2 CLASS="ueberschrift-western">Enhanced SVG export filter</H2>
<P>Due to the limitations the old export filter has, there have been
made some efforts in the past to create an optimized export filter.
This already available filter offers the possibility to create SVG's
containing multiple slides, that you can navigate trough with mouse
or key events. The functionality of this filter module is comparable
with the functionality of the Flash export filter contained in
StarOffice 7, which means that it doesn't offer any slide
transitioning effects, object animations or sound support at the
moment although the current internal structure of the new filter has
been prepared to handle such topics more easily.</P>
<P>Availability in this case means that there exist some source code
inside the filter project of StarOffice, that can be build upon
request. Due to the fact that there have been strong requests for a
filter containing such functionality for quite a long time, the 
suggestion  in this case would be to release a development snapshot
on OOo within a package component.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">SVG Tiny import filter</H2>
<P>Their have been several inquiries in the past, asking for a SVG
import support in StarOffice. Beside integrating SVG graphics into a
document, people are also asking for a vector  based interchange
format that doesn't rely on the proprietary WMF/EMF
(WindowsMetafile/EnhancedMetafile) format offered by MS. This format
could be used to store OLE replacement graphics within our XML file
format or to offer SVG content via Clipboard.</P>
<P>Due to the fact, that SVG itself is a very complex format,
offering support for stylesheets, scripting, animations, complex
clipping, (clip) pathes and many more sophisticated features, the
effort to create a full featured SVG import would be way beyond our
current possibilities reagarding development resources. But taking
into account, that such a full blown feature set is not needed for
interchange features, a possible way to go would be to write a SVG
import filter on our own, that offers support for the 'SVG Tiny'
format, that is a subset of the pure SVG specification, concentrating
mostly on graphics primitives, which is exactly what we need in this
case. 
</P>
<P>Taking a look at the export side, we should take care of offering
the possibility to save content only with respect to this special
'Tiny' subset, so that we're able to read our own created SVG files.</P>

<h2>Ideas and Feature Wishes for the new Chart</h2>

<h3>Core</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Titles for all axes</li>
    <li>Chart type percentage: allow negative values (group positive and negative values)</li>
    <li>Net chart: allow negative values</li>
    <li>Spline for area charts</li>
    <li>Spline on/off for single series</li>
    <li>Custom increment for logarithmic axis</li>
    <li>Draw/interpolate empty cells</li>
    <li>Mark interpolated points (e.g. of missing data values) with different color</li>
    <li>Pie/donut chart: correct orientation of data series/data points (clockwise)</li>
    <li>Anti-aliasing!</li>
    <li>Offer option to disconnect / connect / reconnect external data from / to a chart. E.g. copy
        a chart via clipboard from Calc to Draw. The chart inside the draw still gets the data from
        the Calc document. But it should be possible to disconnect the data, so that the chart has
        its own data.</li>
    <li>Pie chart: Set different radius for different pie segments</li>
    <li>Set source data for each separate series, in XY-charts each series can have its own X-value
        range and Y-value range, set default values for X (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...), if missing
    <li>Set source data for series titles (e.g. for legend). These source ranges could consist of
        several cells, concatenate their content (optional with/without space)</li>
    <li>Each source data range can be a range list</li>
    <li>Line/XY charts: Draw every 2<sup>nd</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup>/...  point symbol only</li>
    <li>Y-axis (and X-axis in XY charts): Scale axis month-wise (e.g. every 15<sup>th</sup> of a
        month)</li>
    <li>For calculated curves like regression curves or trend lines it should be possible to display
        their parameters (or formulas) in the legend.</li>
    <li>New chart types: bubble, surface</li>
    <li>Set fixed data as source for series, like '={1, 2, 3, 5}'</li>
    <li>Set axis properties like minimum and maximum from cells of a spreadsheet</li>
    <li>Allow change of spacing between axis and axis labels</li>
    <li>grid-areas in addition to grid-lines: like in a spreadsheet, where you
        have an alternating background color for odd and even rows.  Open
        question: How do you combine vertical and horizontal <em>stripes</em>,
        e.g., checked rectangles or combining the grid-colors</li>
    <li>Make it possible to plot error-bars for <em>x</em>-values as well as
        <em>y</em>-values.  Allow errors for error bars to come from a data
        source, e.g., a column or row of a spreadsheet.</li>
    <li>Allow axis to go from right to left or top to bottom instead of the
        other way round (like usual)</li>
    <li>New chart-type: multiple pies in one chart.  If you have a rectangular
        range of data you can visualize these as rings, but instead you can also
        put multiple complete pie-diagrams in a grid.</li>
    <li>If an x-axis shows categories and you have too many of them, the labels
        may be reduced, so that you see only some of them (such that they don't
        overlap).  This should also affect the tick-marks.  Maybe a user should
        also be able to enter a number (n) such that only every n<sup>th</sup>
        tick-mark is drawn.</li>
	<li>Regression curves should also allow extrapolation (trend-lines), i.e.,
        if the input data goes from 1.0 to 8.0, but the <em>x</em>-axis scale
        goes from 0.0 to 20.0, you should see a linear regression in the entire
        range from 0.0 to 20.0</li>
    <li>Regression curves for <it>x</it>-values in addition to the existing
        regression curves for <it>y</it>-values.</li>
    <li>It should be possible to add multiple regression curves to one data
	    series.</li>
    <li>Average value line not only for <it>y</it>-values but also for
        <it>x</it>-values, and in addition a symbol marking the intersection
        point (the center of gravity).</li>
    <li style="color:#080;">Formatting of single line-segments in a line- or
	    scatter chart.  (Probably by changing data-point line-style for the
	    point to which the segment leads?)</li>
</ul>

<h3>API</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Set/get diagram area position/size with <strong>and</strong> without axis caption/data caption</li>
    <li>One class for all axes [ no more (X|Y|Z)AxisSupplier, only AxisSupplier ]</li>
    <li>New property LegendPositionManual</li>
    <li>Properties for legend orientation: horizontal/vertical, multiple rows/columns</li>
    <li>Allow access to single series of data rather than the entire array.</li>
    <li>Customizable axis labels.  Set label texts and numbers independently from the
        underlying scale or categories array.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GUI</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Pie chart: change properties for all data points together</li>
    <li>Sizeable legend</li>
    <li>Data point symbol: change line and fill color</li>
    <li>3d controller for rotation, Reset button</li>
    <li>Set dimensions for diagram size</li>
    <li>Apply vector graphics to chart as skin</li>
    <li>Flexible selection, intuitive navigation through objects</li>
    <li>Percentage data labels with flexible decimal places (less than two)</li>
    <li>Rotatable data labels</li>
    <li>Animation for chart elements</li>
    <li>Fully formatable legend</li>
    <li>New Data Editor</li>
    <li>Data Import from several data sources (Internet, Calc, Excel etc.)</li>
    <li>Created Chart as template on other charts assign.</li>
    <li>Easy to Use AutoPilot</li>
    <li>Provide Styles (Templates) like in other applications (or better ;-)</li>
    <li>Enable selection with Tab-key through all chart elements</li>
    <li>Format of series: make it possible to choose one, several or all series in the dialog</li>
    <li>Reorder all series depending on the value of a specific point of each series &#150; Useful
        for e.g.  stacked/percentage/donut charts</li>
    <li>Axis scaling dialog: Axis has time format and main/help interval is &lt;24 hours: show them
        with time format instead of double</li>
    <li>connectors between data points and labels (especially for pies)</li>
    <li>allow free positioning of data labels</li>
    <li>dragging of pie segments should also work for donuts: change distance between rings, and
        allow <em>exploding</em> for the outermost ring.</li>
    <li>Allow text attributes for single portions of text (see Issuezilla task
        <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1489">#1489</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Embedding in Spreadsheet</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Smart detection of labels.  If data for a chart is structured like this:<pre>
        |   A    B    C    D
      --+--------------------
      1 |        X    Y    Z
      2 | 1999  123  234  345
      3 | 2000  876  765  654
      4 | 2001  665  443  221</pre>
    detect the numbers in the first column as labels because the cell A1 is empty</li>
    <li>if a column or row (especially the first one of a range) is formatted with a
    Heading style use it for labels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Killer feature: net chart with spline :-)</li>
</ul>

        <h1>Developer notes for new chart2:</h1>
        <br>
        If you would like to test the new chart, you will need to use the calc, enter 
        some values there and insert a chart as usual - via menu or toolbox. The selected data is currently 
        always interpreted as follows: The first row is used for labels, the first 
        column is used as categories (for the x-axis) and the series take their data 
        from columns.<br>
        <br>
        The new chart will not open at the usual position on the calc page, but in an 
        own fullscreen window for the moment.
        <br>
        In front of the window you will see the new chart wizard.
        It is not finished yet, but can give you a first impression.
        On the first page you are able to select some of the offered charttypes.
        On the second page you are able to enter titles and check visibility of legend and grids.
        The second page is considered to work completly.
        A page to change the data range is still missing.
        <br>
        Pay attention that loading or saving will not work at all, so you can use the 
        new chart only for temporary experiments at the moment.<br>
        <br>
        In the following there are list of what you can try to do, what is not 
        implemented at all and what can be used but will be reworked again anyway.<br>
        <br>

                    stock charts only work if they have sufficient data, otherwise you only get 
                    lines (which is the chart-type for additionaldata that is not used by the 
                    candlesticks). This means also that the Chart Type dialog displays a simple 
                    Line Chart as current type.<br>

This snapshot brings a vast number of improvements. Please see below for the updated list of new bug fixes and known issues with this release.</p>
<p class="warning">All snapshots until we release the a beta product should not be used for production work, as the software may crash and may destroy your data. A backup of all documents used in OpenOffice.org Aqua is recommended. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Printing now works, though it does not yet use an aqua print dialog</li>
  <li>PDF export now works</li>
  <li>Copy and Paste should now work fully</li>
  <li>OpenOffice.org no longer crashes after quiting</li>
  <li>Text and graphics are now drawn properly</li>

  <li>Combo boxes now look a lot better</li>
  <li>Various bugs, crashes and performance improvements</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>There is a black flash when opening new windows</li>
  <li>OpenOffice.org still has problems with Aqua's  device resolution indepence</li>

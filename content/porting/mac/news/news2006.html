<p>
On november 4th, Apple delivered an X11 update that 
improved many things. But, due an issue with the fonts, it also 
broke the OpenOffice.org suite, the full featured open source 
office suite and one of the most used X11 software on mac.
<br/>
On november 14th, Apple published a new update. OpenOffice.org 
mac porting team has tested it and confirmed the issue is 
solved. All the users are encouraged to update to the latest X11 
version of 1.1.3. This can be done through the Apple software update or by downloading it 
from <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11update2006113.html">http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/x11update2006113.html</a>. 
No more action is needed.
<br/>
OpenOffce.org, in the name of its users, thanks Apple for the fast update.

<p>
It has come to our attention that there is a problem in the latest stable release
of OpenOffice.org on the Mac and the X11 Update that Apple released on  
1 November 2006. The problem is related to the Vera fonts that are related
to the X11 update. We have found the following solution that will require 
an administrator user account for each machine concerned. Please follow
the following steps which will allow OpenOffice.org to run again.
</p>
<ol><li>Log in as an Administrator (if you haven't already), an Administrator 
account is created by default when you install Mac OS X or setup your computer
for the first time.</li>
<li>Start the program called <code>Terminal</code>, it is located in the <code>Utilities</code>
folder.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the following command into the Terminal window: <code>sudo mkdir -p /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF.bad</code></li>
<li>You will be asked for your password for the account that you are logged
in under. Type it in, don't worry, your password won't be shown to the world.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the following command into the same Terminal window as above (all on one line): <code>sudo mv /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF/Vera*.ttf /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TTF.bad</code></li>
<li>You should now be able to start OpenOffice.org normally.</li>
</ol>
<p>When OpenOffice.org 2.1 is released, please upgrade as it will not have an issue with this.
Apple should also be releasing an updated X11 update soon with the corrected Fonts.<br/>
Please take a look at the following issues for more information: <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=71096">71096</a>.</p>

<p>Today the Mac Porting Team are releasing OpenOffice.org for
Mac OS X (with X windowing) 2.0.4 in <a href="../download/index.html">English</a> and <a href="../download/index.fr.html">French</a>.
Unfortunately the volunteers who were testing the previous German
versions have been unable to do the same for 2.0.4. This means that
users of the German build of OpenOffice.org for Mac OS X, will have to
either use the English or French versions, or use the untested German
build that is still <a href="../download/OtherDownload.html">available</a>.</p>

pages have been localised in French. They are available from <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/download/index.fr.html">http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/download/index.fr.html</a>.</p>

<p> If anyone wishes to localise any other pages on the Mac

appropriate translations. The naming convention that you will use is <i>&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;language

<p>There has been some confusion about the relationship between
OpenOffice.org and NeoOffice and we would like to clear things up.</p>

<p>Our focus is and must be porting OpenOffice.org to the Mac. In
the last year, we have been very successful in getting 2.0 to the Mac
OS (X11) and our team now includes many. We are further taking the port
to Mac Intel, and beta builds are running of this. These are real and
important accomplishments, and they could not have been done without
the support of the community. Our ultimate goal is to fully port
OpenOffice.org to Mac OS X on Aqua. For that, we need all the help the
Mac community can provide.</p>

<p>Direct links to NeoOffice were removed because our focus is on
OpenOffice.org, not NeoOffice, which is a derivation based
substantially (more than 98 percent) on OpenOffice.org code. If the
OpenOffice.org coding effort is to be successful, we need for users to
work directly with us.</p>

<p>We have no argument with NeOffice and wish them the best in
their efforts. Their approach differs from ours but satisfies many
users. We invite them to work with us in building OpenOffice.org 2.0.3
and beyond and in fully porting OpenOffice.org to the Mac. We are also
open to the idea of collaborating: exchanging ideas and code (when
possible) in a useful, friendly, and productive way.</p>

<p>We hope this clears up some of the misunderstandings. Again,
we invite friendly collaboration and cooperation and would like for the
Mac community to help us port OpenOffice.org to Aqua.</p>

<p>If you want to join the fun, go to Mac Porting site Our list
is mac@porting.openoffice.org.</p>

One for Tino Rachui and one for Stephan Schaefer. These very fast
machines will replace old G3's, which were good but slow machines.</p>

<p>OpenOffice.org announced the first build of OpenOffice.org
2.0.1 for Mac OS X (X11) that can run natively on the newly released
Macintosh Intel desktops. No other fully equipped office suite can
claim as much, and ours gives users not just standards compliance but
real interoperability. Led by &Eacute;ric Bachard, the team
includes Eric Hoch, NAKATA Maho, Tino Rachui, Sophie Gautier, Pavel
Jan&iacute;k, David Nedrow, James Mckenzie, Filip Molčan, "Mox",
and many, many others. The group, which created this version in very
little time indeed, is now eager to move even faster--with your help.
Download the build, test it, participate. We are way ahead of the
Redmond folks, let's keep it that way!</p>

<p>The builds provided for Intel based Macs are alpha and thus
risky. They only run on Mac-Intel boxes.</p>

MacOSX Porting Team of OpenOffice.org. We would like to extend our
thanks to those who made these donations to the MacOSX Porting Team on <a href="donations.html">this web page.</a>Porting
OpenOffice.org to MacOSX X11, MacTel (MacOSX for the Intel processor
base) and MacOSX Aqua is easier with these donations.</p>

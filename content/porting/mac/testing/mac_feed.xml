		There has been some confusion about the relationship between OpenOffice.org
    		and NeoOffice and we would like to clear things up.

    		Our focus is and must be porting OpenOffice.org to the Mac. In the last
    		year, we have been very successful in getting 2.0 to the Mac OS (X11) and
    		our team now includes many. We are further taking the port to Mac Intel, and
    		beta builds are running of this. These are real and important
    		accomplishments, and they could not have been done without the support of
    		the community. Our ultimate goal is to fully port OpenOffice.org to Mac OS X
    		on Aqua. For that, we need all the help the Mac community can provide.

    		Direct links to NeoOffice were removed because our focus is on
    		OpenOffice.org, not NeoOffice, which is a derivation based substantially
    		(more than 98 percent) on OpenOffice.org code. If the OpenOffice.org coding
    		effort is to be successful, we need for users to work directly with us.

    		We have no argument with NeOffice and wish them the best in their efforts.
    		Their approach differs from ours but satisfies many users. We invite them to
    		work with us in building OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 and beyond and in fully
    		porting OpenOffice.org to the Mac. We are also open to the idea of
    		collaborating: exchanging ideas and code (when possible) in a useful,
    		friendly, and productive way.

    		We hope this clears up some of the misunderstandings. Again, we invite
    		friendly collaboration and cooperation and would like for the Mac community
    		to help us port OpenOffice.org to Aqua.

    		If you want to join the fun, go to Mac Porting site Our list is
    		mac@porting.openoffice.org.

		There was a donation of two iMac Intel 20" to OpenOffice.org. One
    		for Tino Rachui and one for Stephan Schaefer. These very fast machines
    		will replace old G3's, which were good but slow machines.

		OpenOffice.org announced the first build of
    		OpenOffice.org 2.0.1 for Mac OS X (X11) that can run natively on the
    		newly released Macintosh Intel desktops. No other fully equipped office
    		suite can claim as much, and ours gives users not just standards
    		compliance but real interoperability. Led by Eric Bachard, the
    		team includes Eric Hoch, NAKATA Maho, Tino Rachui, Sophie Gautier,
   		Pavel Janik, David Nedrow, James Mckenzie, Filip Molƒçan, "Mox",
    		and many, many others. The group, which created this version in very
    		little time indeed, is now eager to move even faster--with your help.
    		Download the build, test it, participate. We are way ahead of the
    		Redmond folks, let's keep it that way!

    		The builds provided for Intel based Macs are alpha and thus risky.
    		They only run on Mac-Intel boxes.

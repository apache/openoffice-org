<h3>Support Resources</h3>

<p>So you've started using OpenOffice.org. Wonderful! Chances are you
may have questions about problems you encounter in the software or want
to learn more about it. There are a number of ways you can get help
with the software. Visit our <a href="http://support.openoffice.org/index.html">OpenOffice.org Support Home</a> for more information on getting help with OpenOffice.org</p>


<p>

<h3> Download troubles</h3>

<p>There are various reports from users on our mailinglist that they
have problems downloading OpenOffice.org using Safari the default
browser for Mac OS X. Safari isn't capable of directly downloading from
FTP servers so Safari passes download requests for files from a FTP
server through to the Finder, the Finder connects to the FTP server and
fails. This may be a bug in Mac OS X 10.3.x and 10.4.x which cannot be
solved by OpenOffice.org developers.</p>

<p> There are two known solutions:

</p>
<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Even though the Finder has problems with passed through
downloads from Safari the download often works when you copy the
download url to the clipboard, switch to the Finder-&gt;Go-&gt;Connect
to Server and paste the url in the empty line below Server Adress.
Click "Connect" and the see if the Finder now connects to the download
server.</p>
  </li>


  <li>
    <p>Mozilla/Gecko based browsers like <a href="httP://www.mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> are capable of directly downloading from FTP servers.</p>
  </li>


</ul>

<p>As the file is downloaded, you will see the icon of the Disk Image
(dmg) File appear. When the download is finished, simply double click
on the icon of the "dmg" file, and drag the OpenOffice.org "Icon" in
your applications folder. </p>

<h3>Online Help and Manuals</h3>

<p>One of the quickest references to get to is the OpenOffice.org
Online Help (under the Help menu). This online help contains a thorough
description of the application.</p>

<p>You can also go to your local bookstore and pick up several books such as the <i>OpenOffice.org Resource Kit</i> and <i>StarOffice Companion</i>.
While these books are not specific to Mac OS X, OpenOffice.org on Mac
OS X is nearly identical to all other platforms and these books will
still be valuable references.</p>

out by browsing through them from time to time and answering questions

<h3>Paid Support</h3>

<p>If you require commercial support, you may want to check out some of the <a href="http://support.openoffice.org/index.html#cst">commercial OpenOffice.org support providers</a>.
Be aware that not all may provide assistance with Mac OS X, however, so
be sure to check to make sure they support the Mac OS X plat form..</p>


<h3>Filing Bugs</h3>

<p>OK, say you've found a glitch in the software (a bug, like the
software crashes when opening this certain file) and haven't been able
to find an answer in any of the support resources. The next step is to
file an issue about it. See the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/bug_writing_guidelines.html">IssueZilla</a>
page for more information about what a proper report should contain and
where to file it. Mac-specific bugs should be filed against the <b>porting</b> project.</p>

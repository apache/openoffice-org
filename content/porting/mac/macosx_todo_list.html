<h1>What Still Needs to be Done to Complete the Mac OS X 10.0.x Port?</h1>
</font></b> 
<p> As of the OO638C release tag, only the modules in the Abstraction and 
  Infrastructure Layers of OpenOffice.org have been ported. Accordingly, a full 
  build of OpenOffice.org is not possible at this time. The purpose of this document 
  is to provide a list of all of the known tasks that need to be done to create 
  an installable and runnable version of OpenOffice.org for Mac OS X 10.0.x. </p>
<p> For all items in the list, it is assumed that the developer has been able 
  to build all of the modules in the Abstraction and Infrastructure Layers of 
  OpenOffice.org and can successfully run their test programs. For instructions 
  on how to build the Abstraction and Infrastructure Layers of OpenOffice.org 
  on Mac OS X 10.0.x, <a href="build_mac.html">see the build instructions.</a> </p>
<p> <b>Warning:</b> This list is only applicable to the OO638C release 
  tag and Mac OS X 10.0.x. Due to the continuing enhancement in functionality of OpenOffice.org, developers 
  may find tasks that need to be done that are not on this list.</p>

    <td bgcolor="#f0f0f0" valign="top">Get remaining modules to compile</td>
    <td bgcolor="#f0f0f0" valign="top"> As of the OO638C release tag, about
      half of the modules are able to be compiled on Mac OS X 10.0.x. Hence, the remaining 
      modules need to be made to compile before the installation program and 
      OpenOffice.org itself can be run. Although nearly all of the code in the 
      remaining modules is platform independent, developers will find many 
      instances where the code will not compile without some changes. Most of 
      the required changes will fall into one or more of the following categories: 
      <ul>
        <li> Mac OS X 10.0.x compiler and other technical issues - For an extensive list 
          of such issues, <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/macosx_issues.html">see 
          the issues page. </a></li>
        <li> Missing native code - By default, if there is native windowing code, 
          the build will try to build the X11-based windowing code. In such cases, 
          you will need to create a new platform-dependent directory and create 
          the necessary C++ class implementations and C functions to support Mac 
          OS X's windowing APIs. For an example of how to create a new platform-dependent 
          directory, take a look at the dtrans/source/aqua and the dtrans/source/X11 
          directories in the source code. </li>

      of ASCII characters and only supports printing using the default system 
      font. In order to support the Western European languages that OpenOffice.org 
      supports on other platforms, printing of Unicode characters needs to be 
      implemented. Also, in order for OpenOffice.org to have a smooth appearance, 
      support for multiple fonts and font sizes needs to be implemented. The current 
      font support for Mac OS X 10.0.x is implemented in the vcl/aqua/source/gdi source 
      directory. </td>

    <td bgcolor="#f0f0f0" valign="top"> The Java 1.1 JNI APIs do not work correctly 
      in Mac OS X 10.0.x's native Java Runtime Environment (JRE). So, the current Java 
      support for Mac OS X 10.0.x uses Java 1.2 JNI APIs. This implementation, however, 
      is very minimal, in that the only configuration that has been implemented 
      is setting of the JRE's CLASSPATH. In order for OpenOffice.org to properly 
      interact with the Java 1.2 JNI APIs, the implementation needs to be expanded 
      to include setting of the following items: 
      <ul>
        <li>JRE command line options (e.g. stack size, debug port, etc.)</li>
        <li>System properties</li>
      </ul>
      The current JNI API support for Mac OS X 10.0.x is implemented in the stoc/source/javavm

      code uses emulated modality by controlling the stacking order of modeless 
      windows. In the current implementation, the code controlling the stacking 
      order is not connected to the Mac OS X 10.0.x native windows. The current Mac OS 
      X native event handling support is implemented in the vcl/aqua/source/app

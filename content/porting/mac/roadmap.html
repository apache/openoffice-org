						<h2>Mac OS X Porting Roadmap</h2>
						<p><i>Last Modified July 25, 2002 by <a href="mailto:OPENSTEP@openoffice.org">Edward Peterlin</a></i></p>
						<p>This page contains a rough outline of how the Mac OS X team will approach the work that remains in the porting effort.  By no means is this meant to be binding, however, and all commentary is appreciated.  For discussion, please join the <a href="mailto:dev-subscribe@porting.openoffice.org">dev@porting.openoffice.org</a> mailing list and talk away!</p>
						<p>Hopefully after each phase of the port a binary could be made available for public consumption.  All of them will be 'bleeding edge' binaries until all of the missing code is implemented.</p>

						<p><a name="OO638"></a><b>Successful Build and Link of OO638C_MacOSX</b></p>
						<p>It is with great pleasure that the OS X porting team can announce the first successful build and link of OpenOffice.org on OS X on both the X11 and Quartz platforms!
							Specifically, we have been able to get a full compilation using the X11 VCL, and have been even able to produce reasonably
							stable binaries.  The Quartz build is successful, but the Quartz VCL is nowhere near as complete as the X11 VCL.  Further work to finish the Quartz VCL will be postponed until after we've moved to the latest set of source for 1.0.</p>
						<p><a name="OO641"></a><b>Migration to OOO_STABLE_1</b></p>
						
<p>We've finished the inital legwork and have gotten the 1.0.1 sources, also known as OOO_STABLE_1, compiling for our DarwinPPC/X11
branch.  This means that all you developers who didn't want to wrangle with something that didn't compile no longer have any
excuses!  We're going to progress onwards to getting 1.0 fully released on DarwinPPC.  Because this version is identical to the
Quartz version with the exception of the vcl module, a functional DarwinPPC/X11 build will get us most of the way to the finished
Quartz Mac OS X native build.</p>
<p>At this time, Quartz does not yet compile for OOO_STABLE_1.  We need people to help migrate the Quartz specific changes from
OO638C to 1.0.  With as few people as we have on this port, we just don't have the time!<p>
<p><a name="FinishImpl"></a><b>Completion of Missing Implementations</b></p>
						<p>Just getting a successful build doesn't mean that all of the porting work is completed.  Several modules have missing implementations or need to be skipped in order to get a successful Mac OS X build.  In order to create a full release, these missing implementations need to be created.</p>
						<p>Below is the list of work that the needed to be undertaken in the OO638C release tag in order to have a full implementation. This list will still be applicable for the OO641 tag.</p>

In such cases, you will need to create a new platform-dependent directory and create the necessary C++ class implementations and C functions to support Mac OS X's windowing APIs. For an example of how to create a new platform-dependent directory, take a look at the dtrans/source/aqua and the dtrans/source/X11 directories in the source code.

In order to support the Western European languages that OpenOffice.org supports on other platforms, printing of Unicode characters needs to be implemented. Also, in order for OpenOffice.org to have a smooth appearance, support for multiple fonts and font sizes needs to be implemented.

So, the current Java support for Mac OS X 10.1.x uses Java 1.2 JNI APIs. This implementation, however, is very minimal, in that the only configuration that has been implemented is setting of the JRE's CLASSPATH. In order for OpenOffice.org to properly interact with the Java 1.2 JNI APIs, the implementation needs to be expanded to include setting of the following items:
									<ul>
										<li>JRE command line options (e.g. stack size, debug port, etc.)
										<li>System properties

The current Mac OS X native event handling support is implemented in the vcl/aqua/source/app source directory and the platform-independent event processing is in the vcl/source/window source directory.</td>

						<p>Once all of these features, and any other features missing from the list have been completed, hopefully a binary can be produced that matches the full OpenOffice.org 1.0 release feature set.
						<p><a name="BetaTest"></a><b>Beta Testing</b></p>
						<p>With a full binary available, Mac OS X installers can be created to allow end users to begin working with the Mac OS X port.  This port will have the same look and feel as OpenOffice.org on other target platforms.  Hopefully with a full feature set enough end users will begin testing the software to allow the Mac OS X porters to fix any runtime errors the port may contain.</p>
						<p>After all the errors are fixed, perhaps the OS X version can become stable enough to merit a 1.0 release.</p>
						<p><a name="AquaLAF"></a><b>Aqua Look and Feel</b></p>
						
<p>When all of the features are complete and the binaries are stable, we can begin 
  giving OpenOffice.org a traditional Aqua OS X look and feel. Although the 1.0 
  release will be full featured, it will not behave like an expected Macintosh 
  application. The goal of this phase will be to add in platform customization 
  to make OpenOffice.org into a good Mac citizen while maintaining the abstractions 
  of the vcl and existing widget set for compatibility with continued OpenOffice.org 
  cross-platform development.</p>
						<p>At the current time, it does not appear that the Aqua look and feel will be possible for an X11 windowing OS X build.  This may be the appropriate time, therefore, to either investigate creating a specific Darwin porting team to maintain the X11 OS X VCL code or to split off further Aqua VCL development to another team.</p>

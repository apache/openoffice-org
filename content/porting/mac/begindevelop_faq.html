<h2>Beginning Mac OS X OpenOffice.org Developer's FAQ</h2>
<p><i>Last updated August 1, 2002</i></p>
<p>This FAQ was originally authored on the developer mailing list by Terry Teague.  We'll add to it as we find more great suggestions as we go along!  All text from here below is Terry's!</p>
<br>
<p>
OK, I have heard about OOo and got to this web site, and I am interested in
working on the Mac OS X version. Where do I go next?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand this is a large project, and can be overwhelming. You should
have some familiarity with Open Source projects, CVS, and Mac OS X command
line. Be prepared to invest time in learning, and dealing with unexpected
problems.</li>
<li><p>Read the documentation on the web site to learn more about the OOo
project as whole.</p>
<p>
You can find this at <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/documentation.html">http://www.openoffice.org/documentation.html</a>.</p></li>

<li>Read the OOo FAQs to learn more about the OOo project as whole.</li>

<li>Browse the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/mail_list.html">mailing list</a> archives (particularly
<a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=dev">dev@porting.openoffice.org</a>) to get a feel for how other developers are
working on the project.</li>

<li> Join the OOo project development effort by creating an account (and
getting access).</li>

<li>Obtain the current stable version of the source code for OOo (CD or
tarball or CVS).</li>

<li> <p>Read and follow the Mac OS X <a href="build_mac.html">build instructions</a> to build the current
version of the project.</p>

<p>
Probably just needs a few additions to fill in the holes
experienced by us newbies.  [Ed P. -- please make suggestions and corrections as you find them!!]</p></li>

<li>Read the <a href="roadmap.html">Mac OS X porting roadmap</a> to see what has to happen for OOo on
Mac OS X to be completed.</li>

<li>Get involved - ask questions on the mailing lists, and start
experimenting with and modifying the source code.</li>

<li>You are now an expert &lt;grin&gt;.</li>
</ul>

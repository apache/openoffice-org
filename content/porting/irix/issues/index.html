<h1>General Issues</h1>
<p>This section will be used to list all past and current issues that impose
problems in building or running openoffice.org.</p>
<p> Here will be listed all issues that are generic across all openoffice.org
builds, and every other section will entail issues related to only that build.
</p>
<h2>Porting Bridges</h2>
<p> Bridges is the module within OpenOffice.org that allows bindings between
languages and object models. This is achieved by creating a proxy object in
one environment (a specific language and hardware platform) so that the actual
object represented by the proxy is available in a second environment.</p>
<p>The way in which OpenOffice.org achieves this is by creating bridges to the
binary UNO specification (which is very low level to reduce performance
penalties), this way there is a reduced number of bridges between
environments. The bridges required for OpenOffice.org to run are:</p>
<table class=clear>
  <tr>
    <td>C++ -&gt; UNO </td>
    <td>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>UNO -&gt; C++</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C -&gt; UNO</td>
    <td>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>UNO -&gt; C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Java -&gt; UNO</td>
    <td>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>UNO -&gt; Java</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> The C and Java bridges are compiler, and platform independent, however the
C++ bridge is not. Ralph Thomas has finished the gcc2 bridge for Irix, and it
is clearly working very well! Later on down the track though, we will need
that bridge re-written for gcc3, and for the MIPSpro compilers.</p>
<p>Ralph is currently working on (among other things) a MipsPro bridge, as the
port to MipsPro 7.4 and SGI's STL has started.</p>

<h2>Build Parallelisation</h2>
<p>OpenOffice.org Builds can take up to 24 hours at times, but the potential
to dramatically reduce this number is available. OpenOffice.org uses dmake
to build as it's make system <code>(dmake = distributed make)
</code> which can spawn processes over a number of processors and even
machines. We are currently using an 8 CPU O3K to build OpenOffice.org
and would like to utilise this functionality. The issue here is that the
dependencies in the makefiles are not exactly correct. They work fine for a
sequential build that uses no parallelisation, but can cause troubles during
a parallel build. Almost all of these issues were fixed in 2002, but since
then, there have been changes to the make system that have introduced more
problems. Although these issues are not of the highest priority, they will
eventually be dealt with to allow a faster, seamless build of OpenOffice.org.

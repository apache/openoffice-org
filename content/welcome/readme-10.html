<h3>Common Notes<a name="common"></a></h3>

<p>You can install OpenOffice.org 1.0 along side of an older version of OpenOffice.org. If you later choose to deinstall a previous version of
OpenOffice.org, you must call the setup program of the newer version and run the Repair option. This makes sure that the new version is correctly
registered in your system.</p>

<p>Make sure you have enough free memory in your temporary directory.</p>

<h4>Network Installation: Error When Calling the OpenOffice.org Quickstarter (Windows) <a name="netwin"></a></h4>

<p>If, when starting the system, problems should occur in calling the OpenOffice.org Quickstarter (e.g. invalid link), this is probably due to the fact
that the network drive on which the network installation is installed is not or not yet available.</p>

<p>In most cases, this happens when the network drives are logged in via a login script, thereby establishing the connection for the network drives
parallel to running the programs of the autostart group from which the Quickstarter is also started.</p>

<p>To avoid this problem, the network drive should be connected via the system's services. If this is not possible, the link used to call the Quickstarter
can be removed from the autostart group of the system, or the Quickstarter can already be disabled when installing the workstation installation. If the
system administrator already disabled the Quickstarter during installation of the network installation, then the Quickstarter cannot be selected by the
user in a later workstation installation.</p>

<h4>Changing the User Interface Font<a name="uifont"></a></h4>

<p>In OpenOffice.org you can change the font used for screen display and printing by replacing it with a different font installed on your system. This can
be done using the font replacement function. Choose Tools - Options - OpenOffice.org - Font Replacement to access this function.</p>

<p>To change the font of the OpenOffice.org user interface, you have to replace the default font "Andale Sans UI" with another font and mark the "always"
setting for this replacement.</p>

<p>Refer to the OpenOffice.org Help for a detailed explanation of the dialog.</p>

<h4>Deinstalling a Network Installation Under Common Desktop Environment (CDE) (Solaris) <a name="deinstcde"></a></h4>

<p>The shortcuts set in the CDE in a network installation are not automatically removed during deinstallation. Before deinstallation, enter as
Administrator (root) the following command line to remove the shortcuts from the CDE: /usr/dt/bin/dtappintegrate -u -s [path to OpenOffice.org].</p>

<p>Example: /usr/dt/bin/dtappintegrate -u -s /usr/local/openoffice.org1.0</p>

<h4>Mozilla Address Book Driver (Solaris only) <a name="mozab"></a></h4>

<p>The Mozilla address book driver requires the SUNWzlib package. This package is not part of the minimum Solaris operating system installation. If you
require access to the Mozilla address book, then add this package to your Solaris operating system using the command "pkgadd" from the installation CD.</p>

<h4>File System ReiserFS: OpenOffice.org Will Not Start for User IDs Larger Than 65535 <a name="reiser"></a></h4>

<p>In versions lower than 3.6, the file system ReiserFS causes a problem as soon as the user ID is larger than 65535. The problem is that files temporarily
saved by OpenOffice.org can no longer be removed by the program itself, but rather only by the system administrator (e.g. /tmp/OSL_PIPE_xxx ). The result
is that OpenOffice.org cannot be started. The problem is in the ReiserFS file system and has been fixed in version 3.6 and higher.</p>

<h4>File Locking<a name="filelock"></a></h4>

<p>In the default setting, file locking is turned off in OpenOffice.org. To activate it, you have to set the appropriate environment variables
SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING=1 and export SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING. These entries are already in disabled form in the soffice script file.</p>

<p>Warning: The activated file locking feature can cause problems with Solaris 2.5.1 and 2.7 used in conjunction with Linux NFS 2.0. If your system
environment has these parameters, we strongly recommend that you avoid using the file locking feature. Otherwise, OpenOffice.org will hang when you try to
open a file from a NFS mounted directory from a Linux computer.</p>

<h4>Using Info-ZIP<a name="infozip"></a></h4>

<p>OpenOffice.org uses Info-ZIP to create and unpack the OpenOffice.org installation, as well as for packing and unpacking the OpenOffice.org XML file
format. Info-ZIP programs (ZIP, UnZip and other utilities) are available free of charge and can be used in the source code and as an executable program.
They can be attained by visiting Anonymous FTP sites such as ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/*.</p>

a view to being a long-term contributor to the Community. Please join and checkout the user page at:
<a href="/">OpenOffice.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Registration<a name="registration"></a></h4>

<p>Please take a little time to complete the minimal Product Registration process when you install the software. While registration is optional, we
encourage you to register, since the information enables the Community to make an even better software suite and address User needs directly. Through its
Privacy Policy, the OpenOffice.org Community takes every precaution to safeguard your personal data. If you missed the registration at installation, you

<h4>User Survey<a name="survey"></a></h4>

<p>There is also a User Survey located online which we encourage you to fill out. The User Survey results will help OpenOffice.org move more rapidly in
setting new standards for the creation of the next-generation office suite. Through its Privacy Policy, the OpenOffice.org Community takes every precaution
to safeguard your personal data.</p>

<h4>Report Bugs &amp; Issues<a name="issues"></a></h4>

<p>The OpenOffice.org Web site hosts IssueZilla, our mechanism for reporting, tracking and solving bugs and issues. We encourage all Users to feel entitled
and welcome to report issues that may arise on your particular platform. Energetic reporting of issues is one of the most important contributions that the
User Community can make to the ongoing development and improvement of the suite.</p>

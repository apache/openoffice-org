<H1>ConvWatch</H1>
<p>ConvWatch is a test tool to compare documents not by it's content but by it's graphical
representation. It's based on Caol&aacute;n McNamara's convwatch tool written in Python. Due to some limitations
ConvWatch has been completely rewritten in Java.<br>

<H2>How ConvWatch work</H2>
<p>ConvWatch loads a set of documents and
<OL type="a">
<LI> saves them by the OpenOffice.org equivalents and compares them to a previous
saved set of <IT>proved</IT> output.
<LI> prints the files to PostScript documents and compares them visually to a previous
saved set of <IT>proved</IT> PostScript output (e.g. output from Microsofts Office's <IT>print to
file</IT>).

</OL>
<p>The saved tests ensures no regression against the reference output documents.
The print tests determine if there are differences against the reference printer
output (which could either be created by OpenOffice.org originally so as to test
for layout regressions, or by Microsoft Office so as to compare conversion quality or by
PDF export from OpenOffice.org)</p>
<p>
To make the print tests valid all printing must happen with the same printer
driver (and the same set of fonts, but we'll overlook that issue here).
Some additional software is required to facilitate the comparison.</p>

ConvWatch is a part of the <A HREF="http://qa.openoffice.org/qadevOOo_doc/index.html">qadevOOo environment</A>. It's written in <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">Java</A>
which is good for communication with OpenOffice.org.

So install as follows...

<!-- installation  -->

<A name="installation"></A>
<H2>Installing</H2>

<p>Some software is required to run ConvWatch and have to be installed locally.

<OL>
<!-- printer -->

<A name="standardprinter"></A>
<LI>For Windows environment <STRONG>a standarized printer driver</STRONG> is required <br>
to give a baseline reference. We don't need this in UNIX environments.<br>

Install <EM>Adobe Universal PostScript Microsoft Windows Driver</EM> from
<TT>wingsteng.exe</TT>
Originally download it from: <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads">http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads</A>

Get this <A HREF="crossoffice.ppd"><TT>crossoffice.ppd</TT></A> file also. It is
only need within Microsoft Windows.


<UL>
<p>Select option <EM>local printer</EM>, and use <TT>FILE:</TT> as the port.

<p>When it asks to <EM>select printer model</EM>, choose browse and go to your
<TT>temp</TT>-directory and select <TT>crossoffice.ppd</TT>
and then select <EM>Microsoft Office Generic printer</EM>. Select <EM>no</EM>
to configuring printer when reaching the end of the install process.

<p>Note: This is the same <TT>.ppd</TT> that is the generic OpenOffice.org driver under Unix with a
little modification to fix a resolution related problem. Once installed use
this printer when you <EM>print to file</EM> from Microsoft Office. This allows the same
printer driver to be used under Unix and Microsoft Windows. So in theory the same output
should be created by Unix version of OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Windows
version of OpenOffice.org. In practice
different fonts are available on different platforms and even if the ttf fonts
of Microsoft Windows are made available under Unix and type1 fonts disabled then our
rendering is still different (I've tried a number of approaches). Making Unix
and Microsoft Windows output equivalent is certainly something to be looked into in the
future.  Currently there are enough problems elsewhere to be worked out before
tackling that.

<p><STRONG>Optional</STRONG> make this printer your default Microsoft Windows printer with
<TT>start->settings->printer</TT>, or remember it's name and set this name as a
property like PRINTER_NAME=name into a props file. 
</UL>

<!-- Ghostscript -->

<A name="ghostscript"></A>
<LI><p><STRONG>Ghostscript</STRONG> is required,<br>
get it from <A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/</A>
  For Microsoft Windows only, install it to <TT>c:\gs</TT> so there are less problems.
 Set the environment variable path to
  <TT>c:\gs\gs8.00\bin</TT>. If ready, try <TT>gswin32c --help</TT> in a fresh command line shell if
  you get a usage message, installation of Ghostscript is done.


<!-- Image Magick  -->

<A name="imagemagick"></A>
<LI><p><STRONG>ImageMagick</STRONG> is required<br>
 to compare the images generated by Ghostscript from
the printer output.
Get it originally from: <A HREF="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org/</A>
ConvWatch only need <TT>composite</TT> and <TT>identify</TT> out of this package.

<!--  java -->

<LI><p><STRONG>Java</STRONG> is required,<br>
 the communication between ConvWatch and an OpenOffice.org installation runs over Java UNO. So
   at least a JRE (1.4) is need. Get it from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</A> if not
   already installed.
   
<!-- TODO: check if it is possible to use some older versions -->

<!-- OpenOffice.org  -->

<A name="openoffice"></A>
<LI> <p><STRONG>OpenOffice.org</STRONG> in non debug version is required.<br>
 No extra features has to be
 activate. It's possible to use a debug version, but it's not really
 tested due to the much message boxes about assertions and other. Which will not close
 automatically and so it's not really usable for such automatically tests.

<STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> Don't install OpenOffice.org versions in directories
with white spaces in the name, e.g. <TT>Program Files</TT>. This is not supported
<!-- handled --> right yet.

<A name="msoffice"></A>
<LI> Within Microsoft Windows environment it's possible to say that ConvWatch could use <STRONG>Microsoft
Office</STRONG> to create the output via printer driver, but therefore a Microsoft Office
package is required and must installed. 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Perl</STRONG> is required, if Microsoft Office is used. ConvWatch uses Perl to communicate between itself and
Microsoft Office, so Perl must be installed. Get it from <A
HREF="http://www.activeperl.com">www.activeperl.com</A>.
</UL>

<LI><STRONG>OOoRunnerLight.jar</STRONG> is required, <br>
get it from the <A
HREF="http://qa.openoffice.org/qadevOOo_doc/index.html">qadevOOo
project</A>. This jar contains the complex test environment which is need to run
ConvWatch.

</OL>

<!-- -->

<H2>Complex test</H2>
ConvWatch is realized as a complex test. This complex test environment is be
able to open/start an already installed OpenOffice.org, also close this
opened OpenOffice.org and some more
for automatically test runs.


<p>Only one extra property file is need. 

<!-- -->
<A name="propertyfile"></A>
<H2>Property File</H2>
<p>To control the
ConvWatch process, there must exist a property file. 

<p>Lines starts with '#' are comments. Empty lines are allowed.

<p>In this property file the information stored, where to find the documents, where
to find the references and where have to go the results.

<p>It also contains the call to a OpenOffice.org executable.

The variables will describe <A HREF="#propertyvariables">here</A>.

<DIV CLASS="CODEFRAGMENT"><PRE>

DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH=/path/to/document-pool

DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_PATH=/path/to/references

DOC_COMPARATOR_OUTPUT_PATH=/path/to/convwatch_results

AppExecutionCommand=/opt/openoffice2/program/soffice -headless -norestore -nocrashreport -accept=socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;

</PRE></DIV>

<H3>Enhancements</H3>
<p>Due to the fact, that ConvWatch works within Microsoft Windows or Unix environment, but there
are different path variables to set, there exist a variable prefix. This prefix
based on 7 characters, <TT>wntmsci</TT>, <TT>unxlngi</TT>, <TT>unxsols</TT> or
<TT>unxsoli</TT>, but doesn't need to set.

So instead of <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> use
<TT>unxlngi.DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> or <TT>wntmsci.DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> or
<TT>unxsols.DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> so there must only exist one property file for all
environments.

<!-- Property Variables  -->
<A name="propertyvariables">
<H2>Property Variables</H2>
</A>
As follows a description, which properties exists and how they work in the
ConvWatch environment. 
<p>At the moment the variables must exist in the <A HREF="#propertyfile">property file</A> from the Java
file, there are other ways to manipulate such variables like shell paramater or
environment variables but this described method is to favour.

<p>The first three variables are the most important, and must set, the other
variables are optional.

<!--  -->
<DL>
<DT><A name="inputpath"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</B></A></DT>
<DD>
<p>Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> to the location of the original document file.
ConvWatch will not really compare documents, but it's output. So for a original
document there must also exist a reference document which must have the same
name but with <TT>*.prn</TT> extension.
If no reference exist, the test for this document failed.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="outputpath"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_OUTPUT_PATH</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_OUTPUT_PATH</TT> to a location, where the results will create. Warning,
there must be enough disk space for this.
<p><STRONG>NEVER</STRONG> set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> to <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_OUTPUT_PATH</TT> or a sub directory of it, you will
lose samples.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="appexecutioncommand"><B>AppExecutionCommand</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Set <TT>AppExecutionCommand</TT> to the OpenOffice.org executable which will be involved by
this test. The parameter for the OpenOffice.org is need to set the
OpenOffice.org in it's listening mode. Find more about OpenOffice Listening mode
in the OpenOffice Developers Guide in chapter 
<A HREF="http://api.openoffice.org/docs/DevelopersGuide/ProfUNO/ProfUNO.htm#1+3+UNO+Concepts">
UNO Concepts</A>.

e.g.: <TT>AppExecutionCommand=/opt/openoffice2/program/soffice -headless -accept=socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;</TT>
<p>
The parameter <KBD>-headless</KBD> is to start the office in background.
</DD>
<p></p>
</DL>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="diffpath"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_DIFF_PATH</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Due to the fact that no program is perfect, there are always differences, we
have to live with. But an automatically process can't really decide if we can
live with such failure or not, it's possible to say where the old differences
from an old run are. So it's possible to check if the new test is at least as
good as an old test.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="gfxoutputdpiresolution"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_GFX_OUTPUT_DPI_RESOLUTION</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_GFX_OUTPUT_DPI_RESOLUTION</TT> to a value of dots per inch
to tell Ghostscript, how big the JPEG
resolution should be. Greater values consume much more memory and need much more
compare time, but the JPEG picture will show a lot of more detailed information. 

A smaller value is much faster due to the fact that less pixels have to
compare. For a first fast overview a value of 75 seems to be enough. 
<p>
The default value is 212. 
So a DIN A4 document results in 1752x2478 pixel sized picture
which consume round about 17MB memory. 

<p>
<B>IMPORTANT</B> If Java fails with memory problems it could be that a special Java
parameter has to set . Search the line where Java is
called and insert <KBD>-Xmx128m</KBD>. Start again, maybe the value 128 isn't
high enough. As default the parameter is not used.
</DD>
<p></p>
<!--  -->
<DT><A name="includesubdir"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_INCLUDE_SUBDIRS</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_INCLUDE_SUBDIRS=no</TT> if ConvWatch should not scan recursive in given
<TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH</TT> directories. The default is to run deep through all sub directories.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="printername"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_PRINTER_NAME</B></A></DT>
<DD>
This parameter set the printer, which will use instead of the standard default
printer. This parameter is only need and supported in Microsoft Windows environment. The
default is to use the standard printer.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="printmaxpage"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_PRINT_MAX_PAGE</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_PRINT_MAX_PAGE</TT> to tell the office, how much pages are export as
maximum. The default is to print all pages.
</DD>
<p></p>
<!--  -->
<DT><A name="printonlypage"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_PRINT_ONLY_PAGE</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_PRINT_ONLY_PAGE</TT> to tell the office, which pages should be
print. This is a string value, e.g. set to "1-4;24" to print page 1 to 4 and
page 24. The default for this value is an empty string.
</DD>
<p></p>
<!--  -->
<DT><A name="referencepath"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_PATH</B></A></DT>
<DD>
<p>Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_PATH</TT> to the location of the reference documents. If
this variable isn't set ConvWatch assume the reference exists near the original document file.
For this the behaviour the DOC_COMPARATOR_INPUT_PATH must be writable.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="referencetype"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_CREATOR_TYPE</B></A></DT>
<DD>
Normally ConvWatch uses the OpenOffice.org printer driver to
create the postscript output.
<p>Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_CREATOR_TYPE=<STRONG>pdf</STRONG></TT>
the internal PDF creator from OpenOffice.org is taken.<br>
To test the internal PDF creator to the normal printer driver. Create the
references without this parameter and the tests with
<TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_CREATOR_TYPE=<STRONG>pdf</STRONG></TT> or vise versa.
</p>
<p>Set <TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_CREATOR_TYPE=<STRONG>msoffice</STRONG></TT> not 
OpenOffice.org creates the output, but Microsoft Office. There must exist a runnable Microsoft Office
on this PC and this works only in Microsoft Windows environment. <br>
To test
OpenOffice.org output within Microsoft Office output, create
the references without this parameter and the tests with
<TT>DOC_COMPARATOR_REFERENCE_CREATOR_TYPE=<STRONG>msoffice</STRONG></TT> or vice
versa.
</p>
<p>
The default, if not set is <STRONG>OOo</STRONG> for OpenOffice.org output.
</p>
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="timeout"><B>ThreadTimeOut</B></A></DT>
<DD>
qadevOOo runner is made for automatically tests, so there exist a possibility to
kill endless running tests after a run out of time. This value is given in
microseconds.
ConvWatch consume very much run time for tests, so set the time out higher. 
e.g. <TT>ThreadTimeOut=3600000</TT> for one hour.
</DD>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="overwritereference"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_OVERWRITE_REFERENCE</B></A></DT>
<DD>
References most the time only needs to create once. So the normal behaviour is
to no overwrite already existing reference files. Set this parameter to true and
also already exist references will overwriten by new once.
So it is possible to run the creation of references again and again.
</DD>
<p></p>

<!--  -->
<DT><A name="gfxcmpwithbordermove"><B>DOC_COMPARATOR_GFXCMP_WITH_BORDERMOVE</B></A></DT>
<DD>
With this parameter it is possible to create a second difference check with
removed borders. Normally all documents have a print border, due to the fact
that the Hardware isn't able to print to the hole paper, also it's not really
a good idea to print as much as possible on one page. Most the time the borders
are equal in documents, but sometimes there could be differences. To see better
the differences of the content of the document, not only that there exist a move
of the content, it is possible to remove the border of every document. Set this
to 'yes' or 'true' and borders will remove by an simple border remove
algorithm.

<p>OK, the result should never fail but should only demonstrate how ConvWatch works.

<p>Now think about the way to only create references with an old OpenOffice.org

one document in the pool.

But be aware, the run could take hours.

<p>If in the Unix environment the PostScript file is only create in black and white,
create a new printer which produce color output and set it as the default

<H2>Java API</H2>
<p>There exist also a possibility to use ConvWatch direct from a Java
environment. 
<p>But, be aware, this is absolutly alpha state, not tested right and in a strong changeable
way. To take a look, get <TT>qadevOOo</TT> project, goto directory <TT>runner/convwatch</TT> open
the Java file <TT>GraphicalDifferenceTest.java</TT> and read it's comments.
There will be create a javadoc documentation about the API in the near future.

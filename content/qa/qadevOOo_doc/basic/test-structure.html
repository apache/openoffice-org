<h1>Test Structure</h1>
<p style="">Source code for basic tests is
stored in XML format in .xba files. </p>
<p style="">There is a separate file and folder
for every interface/service and for every object. Files for objects
contain BASIC procedures for creating and disposing objects.
Interface/service files contain procedures for testing
interfaces and services. These files are loaded on Runner's demand at
runtime into the Office as BASIC modules, and required functions
from these modules are executed.</p>
<p style="">The directory structure is similar
to the one used for Java tests. Filenames should be unique in the whole
scope. This is because basic module's name is exactly the same as a
filename
(without path). So the file for sw.SwXBodyText should be
</p>
<pre>    .../basic/mod/sw/SwXBodyText/sw_SwXBodyText.xba</pre>
For a service like XMLImporter which can be found in xmloff.Chart as
well as in xmloff.Draw, the structure has to be
<pre>    .../basic/mod/xmloff/Chart/XMLImporter/xmloff_Chart_XMLImporter.xba</pre>
<p></p>
<p style="">To pass information between different
BASIC modules, global variables are used. Some global variables are
initialized by the Runner using the "SetValue" command. These
variables are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>cBASPath</b> - root path to BASIC modules (/qadev/tests/basic/)</li>
  <li><b>cTestDocsDir</b> - path to test documents</li>
  <li><b>CNCSTR</b> - a connection string</li>
</ul>
<p>The Runner provides also information about object's implementation
name, optional
properties and methods.</p>
<p style="">All other global variables are set by
<b>BasicBridge.sxw</b> or the by the tests. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>oObj</b> - a reference to the object being tested</li>
  <li><b>oDoc</b> - the document that is used for object creation
(usually only one
document for object creation is required. If <b>oDoc</b> points on
such a document, then it will be disposed automatically in the object
disposing procedure.)</li>
  <li><b>cObjectName</b> - the name of the object being tested; </li>
  <li><b>cIfcShortName</b> and <b>cIfcLongName</b> - different forms
of the name of the interface being tested</li>
  <li><b>NULL_OBJECT</b> - a NULL object.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The object file</h2>
<p>An object file should contain the procedure <b>CreateObj() </b>that
will
be called from the <b>BasicBridge.sxw</b>. In this procedure a global
BASIC variable <b>oObj</b> has to be initialized with an appropriate
object. If the object needs special code for destruction, it
should be implemented in the <b>DisposeObj()</b> procedure. <b>BasicBridge.sxw</b>
checks, if the object has been created properly. There is no need to do
that
yourself.

<br>
</p>
<h2>The interface file</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">To test an interface, <b>BasicBridge.sxw</b>
will call the <b>RunTest()</b> method from the appropriate .xba file.
A test of every method that is supported by the interface should be
implemented in this procedure. Before starting the method testing, a
method
<b>Test.StartMethod(methodName)</b> has to be called. This will
produce some log information and, even more important, this will
set the <b>cCurrMethodName</b> variable to an appropriate value (it is
used
for writing information in case of an exception). After the method was
tested, a method <b>Test.MethodTested(methodName, bResult)</b> has to
be used to tell the Runner about the result of the test. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><img src="p5.gif" name="Graphic5"
 align="left" width="912" height="359" border="0"><br clear="left">
<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Runner provides the <b>BasicBridge.sxw</b>
with
full information about the interface that should be tested. This
information includes the name of the interface, the names of
methods and information if anything is optional. This information is
transformed to an array that is passed to the BASIC part of Bridge.
This <b>info</b> contains also the type of the test (interface test or
service test). </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>info[][][] - first array contains the name of the interface/service + the names of the methods/properties<br>           - second array contains boolean values (true, if interface/method/service/property is optional)<br>           - third array contains the type of the test<br></pre>
Example:<br>
<pre>[0] com.sun.star....  [0] true   [0] interface<br>[1] get...()          [1] false  [1] &lt;not set&gt;<br>[2] set...()          [2] false  [1] &lt;not set&gt;<br>[3] ...               [3] ...    [1] ...</pre>
<p></p>
<h2>The service file</h2>
<p>Usually testing of services is very simple - for every
supported property one just has to call the
<b>PropertyTester.testProperty(propName)</b> procedure, which changes
the value of the property automatically.
In some cases, the value of the property cannot be tested
automatically: if only
certain values are allowed or if the value of the property is not a
simple type.
Then an additional parameter can be passed to the <b>testProperty()</b>
method, an array of defined values. The property will be set to any of
those values.<br>
If no parameter passed, <b>PropertyTester</b> will test
the property simply relying on the property's type.</p>

<h1>Creating own implementations</h1>
<p>For some tests it is required to have own helper implementations for
services, since it is not possible to implement own services directly
in BASIC.
For this one has to provide e.g. a Java class. A class that implements
the XSimpleServiceFactory interface and that can create an instance of
the required service should also be provided.
This ServiceFactory has to be inserted into the MultiServiceFactory of
the Office before connecting the <b>BasicBridge</b>.
These services can be created in BASIC using the
<b>createUnoService(serviceName)</b> method. For detailed information
look
at the <bf>XAcceptor test. This test uses the <b>basichelper.Connector</b>
class for testing the interface.</bf></p>
<h2>Starting Runner</h2>
<p>To run the Basic tests just start <b>./executeBasic -o
sw.SwXBodyText</b> to execute SwXBodyText from sw module.<br>
(confer the <a href="../user-guide.html">General User Guide</a>)
</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>As BASIC tests cannot be started separately from the Runner, there
are some difficulties in debugging. The easiest debug method is to
use message boxes around the code where the problem is located.
Also you could use a debug file. Add to the configuration file
'basic.props' the following entry:</p>
<p>on UNIX: <b>soapi.test.basic.debugFile=/temp/BasicDebug.log</b><br>
on Windows: <b>soapi.test.basic.debugFile=c:\\temp\\BasicDebug.log</b></p>
<p>In this file all information that BASIC sends to Java will be
stored. To create output in the tests,
use <b>Out.dbg("My Message")</b></p>
<h2>Writing style</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Follow these rules while writing basic
tests:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Use <b>option explicit</b></p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This option forces to dimension
every variable that is used in basic code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Headers</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Headers in interface tests contain a
special field named "<b>required</b>". If an interface needs some
variables that should be initialized during the object creation, then
the variables should be inserted into this field. It can be very
helpful when writing objectCreation code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Use functions from <b>BasicBridge.sxw</b>.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">If there is something that should be
done for many objects or interfaces then it is better to move this code
to one of the modules of the <b>BasicBridge.sxw</b> (e.g. <b>utils</b>).
This provides more flexibility.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Some tips</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">During module loading all NON-global
variables may be reseted. So, if you want to reuse a variable after a
library was loaded, define it as global.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">If some interface test requires a
global variable that is an array of UNO structures, it should be
defined as Variant and initialized using additional temporary variables
of the appropriate type.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

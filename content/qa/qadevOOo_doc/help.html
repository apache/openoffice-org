<H1>How can you help</H1>
The are several possibilities for you to help improving this project.
<ul>
    <li>
        Your mission is discovering issues inside the Office API or the test harness itself? Feel encouraged
        to make heavy use of the given frame work and if you find a failure, please write an issue
        with a title as follows:
        <pre>   API: component::interface <br> e.g. API: SwXBodyText::XText </pre>
        for API issues. And
        <pre>   qadevOOo: &lt;title&gt; </pre>
        for issues regarding the test harness.<br>
        In both cases the component is 'api' and they should be assigned to sw@openoffice.org
    </li>
    <li>
        You want to extend the testcases and add the missing ones, then feel highly encouraged to
        check out the sources and extend the functionallity of the testcases.<br>
        If you wonder which testcases still might be missing take a look at the 
        <a href="missing.html">List of missing testcases</a>.
        If you are unable to check in your changed sources feel free to mail them to 
    <a href="mailto:sw@openoffice.org">sw@openoffice.org</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Those who develop own components for the Office will find the harness useful for
        testing purposes. We'd like to get information and feedback to be able to enhance
        our harness, and we would also like to add the testcode written by you to future automated test runs 
        when your component finally found its way in the Office.<br>
        The <a href="http://framework.openoffice.org/scripting/index.html">Scripting Framework Team</a>
        already makes use of this. 
    </li>
    <li>
        We are sure that our test harness is useful for developers of other applications
        that provide an API, too. We'd like to get feedback if you made use of it and if you'd like to have
    any useful extension to it.
    </li>
</ul>

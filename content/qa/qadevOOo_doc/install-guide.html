<H1>Installation Guide</H1>
<P>After you downloaded the qadevOOoSetup class and stored it in a local directory,
  open a shell and switch to this directory. Make sure that java is in
  your PATH and the current directory in your CLASSPATH (see the <!--http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/classpath.html-->
  <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java documentation</a> for more about the classpath), 
  and just call
<br>
<pre>   &gt; java qadevOOoSetup</pre></P>

<P>You will be
asked to which directory the files should be installed and,
afterwards, where your Office-Installation can be found. The
requested Office path is the directory in which the subfolder
'program' is located, so it is the installation directory, if you
made a normal installation, and the installation path of the
server-part, if you made a network installation.</P>

<P>Then the files are unpacked and stored in the directory you chose.</P>
<P>You'll find two scripts to execute Java and Basic tests and a readme
that explains how to use them.</P>
<P>For more detailed information about how to use the Framwork and how it is
structured refer to the <A HREF="user-guide.html">General User Guide</A>

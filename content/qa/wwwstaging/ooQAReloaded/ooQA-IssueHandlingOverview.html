                            Following these rules really makes life easier for all.

                        <li>The issue needs to be confirmed
                            <br>When you are new to OpenOffice.org you don't have the permissin to confirm
                            your issues yourself. So somebody with the required permissions will take over at this point.
                            The OOo volunteer will try to reproduce your problem and - in case
                            of failure - get back to you and ask some more questions. If reproduction succeeds
                            the issue gets a target and will be handed over to development for fixing. If the
                            issue can not be reproduced it is rejected.</li>

                        <li>The issue gets fixed
                            <br>Your issue gets fixed on a CWS [link to explanation]
                             (<u>C</u>hild<u>w</u>ork<u>s</u>pace) by a developer.</li>
                             <br><br><br>
                            
                        <li>The issue needs to be verified on the CWS
                            <br>Your issue will now be verified, meaning that somebody (which could be you as well)
                            takes a look at it by installing a developer build from the CWS. If the fix is not good 
                            (failed completely or insufficient) it goes back to development</li>
                            <br><br><br>
                            
                        <li>The fix is good and gets integrated into the MWS
                            <br>The issue now has the status fixed/verified and gets integrated into the main 
                            development line and you can download it with the next developer snapshot.</li>
                            <br><br><br>
                            
                        <li>Verify the integrated fix
                            <br>Again somebody verifies that the
                            fix did not by accident get lost or corrupted. If all went well the status is changed to 
                            closed/fixed. On any problem the task gets back to development and the cycle starts anew.</li>

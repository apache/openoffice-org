<h1>Submit an issue</h1>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to submit an issue! We really appreciate your help in constantly improving
OpenOffice.org!<br/>
Before you <a style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi">proceed</a>,
please consider the following</p>

<h4><a name="duplicates"></a>Did you check if your problem is already
reported?</h4>
<p></p>Unfortunately, too many issues get reported twice (or much more often).
You, as the submitter who exactly knows the problem, often are much
faster in finding the duplicates than other people. So please take some
minutes to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/query.cgi">see if
your problem is already reported</a>. If so, you can add yourself to
the cc-list of the issue, to be notified whenever something in this
issue changes (e.g. when it's fixed).</p>

<h4><a name="read_the_rules"></a>Please follow the rules</h4>
<p>If this is the first issue you submit, please take a moment to read the
<a href="basic_rules.html">the basic rules</a>. They take you very
little time to follow, but potentially, they save a lot of other people
a lot of time. Short and simple, these are:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="basic_rules.html#one_per_issue">One problem -
one
issue</a></li>
  <li><a href="basic_rules.html#summary">Provide a
meaningful summary</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="basic_rules.html#reproducibility">Provide
step-by-step descriptions</a></li>
  <li><a href="basic_rules.html#bugdoc">Provide sample
documents, if possible</a></li>
  <li><a href="basic_rules.html#attachments">Use Attachments
reasonably</a></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="login"></a>Please log in</h4>
<p>For submitting an issue, you need to <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/TLogin">log in</a>. If you do
not yet have an OpenOffice.org account, please <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/Join">join us</a>. This is
necessary, as issues are bound to their submitter, which, for example, enables other people who work on the reported
problem to ask you back in case of uncertainties.</p>

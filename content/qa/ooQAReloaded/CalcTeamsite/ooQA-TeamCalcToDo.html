                At the moment there are more than 1500 issues in bugzilla in state unconfirmed and with the default owner spreadsheet. All those issues have to be confirmed, checked for duplicates and assigned to the development team.
                To achieve this I would like to announce an IRC session with all who wants to help, the spreadsheet qa-team and some of the development team. This session will happen on *Wednesday,  June 11th , 5 PM (MET) or 3 PM (UTC) at the #qa.openoffice.org channel* on irc://irc.freenode.net
                During this session we will check issues, answer questions and discuss targets. There are issues for all level of knowledge
                Thank you for your help and don't forget to jump in. </SPAN></P>

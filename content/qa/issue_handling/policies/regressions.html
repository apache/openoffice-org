    <h1>Policies: Regressions</h1>
    <p>There are three categories of regression issues we're interested in:

    <ol><li>Functionality which is different from the same functionality in a
        previous version, but the difference is intentional, since the
        respective feature has been overworked, and specified differently than
        before.</li>

        <li>Functionality which is different from the same functionality in a
        previous version, and should be fixed. However, the issue is considered
        too minor to be a stopper for the next (micro) release.</li>

        <li>Functionality which is different from the same functionality in a
        previous version, and is serious enough to be a stopper for the next
        (micro) release.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Categorization of a regression issue into one of the three categories above
    happens as follows:</li>

    <ol><li>After adding a justification (i.e. saying that the change is
        not considered a regression, but an implementation of a new/changed
        concept), the issue is handled as usual. No particular keyword is to be
        set. Any already existent regression keyword is to be revoked.
        <br/>
        In case that the changed functionality/behaviour is controversial, this
        should be discussed in the project  (corresponding to the Issue Tracker
        Component), and may be brought to the project lead to come to a
        decision. If necessary, the issue could be escalated to the
        project leads list. If you cannot escalate to the project leads list
        yourself, contact the Community Contributor Representative at the
        Community Council or the QA project.
        <br/>
        Alternatively and additionally, feel free to get support from other
        people, expressed for instance by <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/page.cgi?id=voting.html">votes</a>
        on the issue</li>

        <li>The <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/describekeywords.cgi">keyword</a>
        "regression" is added to the issue (if not already present), together with a comment
        stating that the issue is not considered a blocker for the next release. The
        <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/page.cgi?id=fields.html#target_milestone">Target Milestone</a>
        is set to the next train release (e.g. "OOo 2.x") or "OOo later", depending on the
        judgement of the issue's severity. After that, the issue is handled as usual. In
        particular, depending on user feedback (e.g. votes), it might be decided to fix
        the issue in the next release.</li>

        <li>The <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/describekeywords.cgi">keyword</a>
        "release_blocker" is added to the issue, the <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/page.cgi?id=fields.html#target_milestone">Target Milestone</a>
        is set to the next minor release.</li>
    </ol>

<h4> OpenOffice.org at the O'Reilly Convention</h4>
<p>The debate between Microsoft's lead propagandist, Craig Mundie and Red Hat's 
  CTO Michael Tiemann was <i>the</i> event everyone was waiting for. It was probably 
  disappointing for most. Mundie, from many accounts, came across, as almost offensively 
  reasonable (the word &quot;unctuous&quot; leaps unbidden to mind), and though 
  he certainly did not win any popularity contest--the crowd was wearing cheap 
  plastic red hats, to give a hint why not--all the same he failed to reveal the 
  tell-tale marks of his demonness: you know, fangs, claws, and smoking breath.

<p>But the touted debate was actually <i>not</i> the most interesting thing of 
  convention. If truth be told, the center of the whole affair was the OpenOffice.org 
  Birds of a Feather seminar which Sun organized. Yes, this claim may be a slight 
  exaggeration, but it's not really much of one. OpenOffice.org, is, as I've long 
  maintained, at the forefront of a new conception of Open Source, in which corporations 
  initiate Open Source projects with the aim of creating communities of developers 
  who will contribute to the code as well as benefit from the companies' opening 
  of the source code of their software. 
<p>The OpenOffice.org BOF was well attended, with around thirty attendees. Max 
  Lanfranconi and Zaheda Bhorat, of the OpenOffice.org Sun core team, carried 
  out a poll at the beginning of the BOF and found all attendees were new to OpenOffice.org. 
  Less than 30% of attendees were aware that the code originated from StarOffice. 
  As a result, the general focus was to provide information about OpenOffice.org, 
  starting with some background, including the project's history. 
<p>OpenOffice.org was also present at the Sun booth at the O'Reilly conference. 
  During the course of the three days, we spoke to new developers and several 
  existing member at the booth. Some of these attendees were at the O'Reilly conference 
  last year, when OpenOffice.org was announced. Some even admitted that they were 
  shy and lurking on the lists; we naturally encouraged them to jump in with their 
  questions, positions, answers. 
<p>There were many questions around the <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac/" target="_blank">Mac 
  OS X port</a>, and when it would be available. Don't be surprised if the Mac 
  OS X people hear from the various interested parties following the conference! 
  In particular, there was one group from the University of Texas wishing to contribute 
  to this development. We also tried to connect members who wanted to build a 
  WordPerfect filter for OpenOffice.org. In sum, we look forward to hearing about 
  progress on the O'Reilly connections on the various mailing lists. 
<p>OpenOffice.org will also be at the upcoming <a href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/" target="_blank">Linux 
  World Expo</a>, to be held in San Francisco, at the Moscone Center, beginning 
  27 August and ending 30 August (see the <a href="/">OpenOffice.org 
  homepage</a> &quot;Announcement&quot; box for special details and a free pass 
  to OpenOffice.org members). If you think that we should be present at any other 
  Open Source meetings, please let us know by sending mail to <a href="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">dev@openoffice.apache.org</a>.

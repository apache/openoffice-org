<h4><br>
  One Million </h4>
<p>Sometime last week, we passed one million downloads, and at our current rate 
  we will serve more binary and source files in the next <i>month</i> than in 
  the previous six. Community activity has been similarly high, with Kevin Hendricks's 
  newly announced &quot;<a href="http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/">Lingucomponent 
  Project</a>&quot; (which works on the spellchecker, dictionary, and so on) and 
  the new &quot;<a href="http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/screenshots/">Screenshots 
  Project</a>,&quot; maintained by Martijn Dekkers and Matt Freeman. For users 
  interested in getting the code on CD-ROM, we now have several companies and 
  individuals, both in the U. S. and Europe, offering very inexpensive <a href="../dev_docs/source/download.html#cdrom">CD-ROMs</a>. 
  What is more, OpenOffice.org continues its tradition of being fully international 
  and available to the world community, with the binaries available in an increasing 
  number of languages. OpenOffice.org code is not just usable, it is being used.

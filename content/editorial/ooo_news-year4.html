Replacing FrameMaker with OOo Writer 
</H2>
<P>&quot;I began comparing FrameMaker and Writer when a regular on
the OpenOffice.org User's list asked what it would take to give
Writer the power of FrameMaker. When I started, I mentally pictured a
scale with Microsoft Word on one end and FrameMaker on another, with
Writer in the middle, but closer to Microsoft Word. As I proceeded, I
found Writer was a much stronger contender than I had expected. At
the end of the comparison, I had to conclude that the two products
compare quite closely, depending on what features are more important
to a given user.&quot;

Germans claim Linux lowers costs</H2>
<P>&quot;The greatest cost saving opportunities that Soreon Research
found were in the adoption of a variety of office applications on
work-stations. Over three-years, a 2000-seat organisation would save
around &euro;525,000 with office applications, &euro;57,000 with
servers, &euro;32,000 with content management systems and &euro;21,000
with databases. For a &euro;1,000,000 budget, the use of
OpenOffice.org instead of Microsoft Office would provide a 20 per
cent cost advantage.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The organisation behind the office suite for Linux has

Nonprofit brings Linux and open source to Hawaii</H2>
<P>&quot;Schools in Hawaii, affected by lean budgets like many other
US states this year, are upgrading their computer systems with help
from the open source community and Linux. A local nonprofit, the
Oahu-based Hawaii Open Source Education Foundation (HOSEF), has
supplied over a dozen Hawaiian schools with computers &quot;recycled&quot;
with the Linux operating system and raised awareness of open source
software (OSS). 
</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>&quot;We have an obligation to reciprocate that which we receive,
if possible. OSS (open source software) has been very good to me. I
have used it to help employers save money. I have used
[Openoffice.org] for my college degrees, and I use it daily on my
computers. If I can take my entrepreneurial, economic, and business
interests and channel my passion for OSS through them, then I
should,&quot; Belford enthuses.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Homeless charity Alone in London spent less than &pound;2,000

<P>&quot;Desktop software such as OpenOffice, while still reaching
maturity, could offer significant savings for large organizations.
Office suite software can cost roughly $300 per seat&mdash;or $3
million in an organization of 10,000 people. That creates real
savings when going to acquisition costs of $0.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>Meanwhile, OpenOffice has climbed to a 14 percent share of the
large enterprise office systems market. Microsoft, however, still
holds a 94 percent share of the overall office market. &quot;It is a

OpenOffice is an open-component product based on APIs and an
XML-based file format. By changing to OpenOffice the Psychiatry saves
an initial investment of DKK 4,8 mill. in license expenses to
Microsoft Office. During 2004 the IT-department designs new templates
and macros, program setup, and plans education, etc. in cooperation
with a test group and our superusers. Finally, on 2 February 2004
OpenOffice 1.1.1 in Danish is introduced on all workstations. By Mid

OpenOffice is a workable and flexible alternative to Microsoft Office</H2>
<P>&quot;All this by way of introduction to my pitch for
OpenOffice.org, an open-source software suite that at best is a lot
more program than Works and at worst only a little less functional
than Microsoft Office.</P>
<P>OpenOffice.org, which was popularized as Star Office from Sun
Microsystems, is more than adequate for perhaps 95 percent of users.
Most interestingly, it is the only free Office-style program that
runs on both Windows and Linux, as well as the Macintosh, and its
files are mostly (more on that later) compatible with Microsoft
Office. You can buy Sun's version, which includes product support,
for $79.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Problems with Word are usually pretty simple to fix, but
complex formulas in Excel occasionally generate outright spurious
results. Setting up a mail list in OO isn't as bonehead simple as it
is with Works. A fair number of users would like to see an integrated
e-mail program and personal information manager, a la Outlook.</P>
<P>But the price is right, and the program is more than adequate for
casual users. If you're doing anything complicated, evaluate the
program yourself.&quot;</P>

Microsoft offers the French 60 per cent off software licences</H2>
<P>&quot;Microsoft has offered a 60 per cent cut off the prices of
its licences for three years to the city of Paris. It's a tactic that
bore no fruit in Munich when the German city government opted for
open-source software on 14,000 desktops earlier this month. Will the
software giant be more convincing in Paris and stop the French making
the swap? Faced with the possibility of losing the French capital,
Gates and chums have opted for the same tactic that they used in
Bavaria when confronted with customers making eyes at Linux or
OpenOffice: agreeing to take a knife to the cost of licences.
According to French daily Lib&eacute;ration, in January, Microsoft
made an offer to Philipped Schil, the Paris mayoral authorities'
director of information technology and systems &ndash; an offer
cutting licence prices by around 60 per cent for the local
government's computers, which meant some 15,000 PCs. In financial
terms, the bill for three years would drop from &euro;13.27m to
&euro;5.65m. &quot;</P>

StarOffice slashes seat costs</H2>
<P>&quot;IT wasn't long ago that Microsoft Office, at $500-plus a
seat, was the only option for businesses seeking an integrated office
suite. Times are changing, however.</P>
<P>Sun Microsystems is slowly winning over large business customers
to its StarOffice 7, which costs $50 a user.</P>
<P>IDC analyst Megan Dahlgren says Sun's success is based on its
reputation for high-quality support, coupled with deep discounting
aimed at getting StarOffice widely adopted by government and big
business.</P>
<P>StarOffice is based on the open-source OpenOffice.org, both of
which offer similar functions to Microsoft Office in spreadsheets,
word processing and presentations.</P>
<P>StarOffice product manager Laurie Wong says Sun Java Desktop is a
complete package made up of StarOffice, Ximian Evolution (an Outlook
alternative) and the Adabase database.</P>
<P>OpenOffice.org and StarOffice claim several technology advantages
over Microsoft Office, including the ability to output PDF files from
the application without needing extra software, the option of using
file formats based on industry-standard XML that are easily readable
by other programs, and cross-platform versions of the package for
Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Solaris.</P>
<P>XML brings an important change in the way office packages work,
enabling storage of structured content in a file, allowing the
information to be reused easily in other applications.</P>
<P>Wong says Microsoft's file format is a binary file wrapped in some
XML tags. &quot;It's XML only as long as you use another Microsoft
application, or one authorised by the company to read it, which is
not in the spirit of XML,&quot; he says.</P>
<P>In comparison, the OpenOffice.org and StarOffice binary file
format is a zipped version of an XML file, allowing other software or
users to see the file format in readable XML.</P>
<P>Sewing machine maker Janome Australia has found the cost savings
of the OpenOffice.org package outweigh the inconvenience of migrating
staff away from Microsoft Office, IT manager Scott Langford says.</P>
<P>The biggest challenge was educating users to import Microsoft
Office documents into the software, he says.&quot;</P>

basic points were first that the Office XML formats are incomplete
(no PowerPoint, missing pieces in Excel), second that the licensing
terms are kind of scary (our lawyer's acid-tongued comments have been
excised from the online papers), third that the OO.o format is much
more reusability-oriented, and finally that Microsoft has iron
control over every  aspect of their XML, while the OO.o format is
well on its way to being an OASIS standard.&quot;</P>

<P>The Executive has not actually bought any licences -- which are
provided at no cost to educational establishments under Sun's
StarOffice 7 Education Licensing programme. But the deal will allow
it to provide licensing support for 2,833 Scottish schools - which
would mean 738,597 students and 50,048 teachers using StarOffice if
every</P>

Migration Study: Health First</H2>
<P>&quot;There are two big IT projects going on at Health First Inc.,
and Linux is at the heart of both of them. Health First, a family of
Brevard County, Fla., nonprofit health care facilities, is migrating
its desktops to OpenOffice[.org] and bringing in many Novell's
Nterprise Linux Services. Weaning 6,000 IT users off of Microsoft
Office 97 on 3,500 PCs is no small feat. It's manageable, however, if
an IT shop takes it one step at a time, according to Danny J. Wall
and Daniel Bray, Health First IT network administrators. Their
primary pain comes from integrating OpenOffice[.org] with Health
First's almost 500 applications.</P>
<P>In part 1 of this in-depth migration story, Wall and Bray explain
why Health First is backing away from Microsoft Office and choosing
OpenOffice[.org]. Next, they describe the OpenOffice[.org]
implementation process. Then, in part three, Wall tells us how Health
First is bringing in and will be using Novell's new Linux services.&quot;</P>

StarOffice: ready for the big time</H2>
<P>&quot;StarOffice is already very popular and has become something
of a standard on Linux PCs often in the guise of OpenOffice[.org],
its open source brother. Sun acquired Star Division GmbH five years
ago, with the clear intention of competing directly with Microsoft.
It has taken time for Sun to establish a competitive position,
though. StarOffice never got strong reviews until version 6, which
debuted in early 2002. It is just now in version 7, which is
attracting even more attention because of the quality of the
release.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For large organizations looking to reduce the costs of the
desktop significantly, Star Office looks compelling. Siemens did a
trial project to test the Ximian/OpenOffice/Linux combination with
office staff in Germany last year. (Open Office has some minor
differences to StarOffice, such as fewer fonts and graphics) Siemens
concluded that changing to Linux and StarOffice was no more expensive
than a Windows upgrade - in terms of training. On top of that, it
saved 20 to 30 per cent in administration costs, 50 per cent in
hardware costs and 80 per cent in licensing costs. Pretty compelling
when you think about it.&quot;</P>

OpenOffice.org BizDev Project</H2>
<P>&quot;We are proud to announce the opening of the Business
Development project of OpenOffice.org (BizDev) The goals of this
project are to build a business partners' network around
OpenOffice.org .</P>
<P>In this regard the BizDev project is the place where commercial
leads, and business and consulting information can be discussed. It
is a project for services professionals who are looking for
customers, projects, and for contributing the way they want. Several
companies have already joined the BizDev project. Among them is the
Olliance Group, based in Palo Alto, California, a consulting firm
pushing the adoption of Open Source Software and open standards in
large companies. They believe in this project and think that letting
businesses participate and generate wealth around OpenOffice.org is a
major asset in today's industry.</P>
<P>&quot;We are seeing and hearing a need for a more supportive and
integrated approach from the community to address users requirements
in deploying Open Source solutions. Creating a project where service
providers can present themselves, communicate, and discuss customer&rsquo;s
needs and topics such as &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; is a bold,
innovative, and needed step by OpenOffice.org&rdquo; said Andrew
Aitken, Managing Partner, Olliance Group, a leading OSS strategic
consulting firm.</P>
<P>As a first step, the BizDev project volunteers have built a
business directory called the Consultants' Directory
(http://bizdev.openoffice.org/consultants.html ) where consulting
businesses get listed in order to maximize their visibility to the
public and the community. This list already provides a large amount
of information and is still growing.&quot;</P>

ICICI OneSource Dumps Microsoft Office For Sun</H2>
<P>[N.B. 1 lak = 100,000. Therefore 72 lakh = 7.2 million. The
currency used is rupees]</P>
<P>&quot;ICICI OneSource, a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)
services provider, has undertaken a bold move of switching its
desktops from Microsoft Office to Sun&rsquo;s StarOffice 7, saving a
whopping Rs 72 lakh in the bargain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Regarding the obvious compatibility qualms that first time
users have - as Microsoft Office is by far the established standard
used worldwide &ndash; Prashanth said, &ldquo;There are many, but so
far we have faced a few with respect to Word and Excel formats when
advanced features are employed.&rdquo;&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Apart from its lower price, another advantage of StarOffice
7 over Microsoft Office is its cross-platform support. Where Office
2003 will run only on Windows 2000 and XP, StarOffice 7 supports
Windows 98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP, as well as Linux and Solaris. The
software offers functionality to enable export to PDF, and the
Macromedia Flash format, and supports 10 languages.&quot;</P>

XML Matters: XML for word processors</H2>
<P>&quot;Free software and XML document formats are a natural
pairing. The inherent readability of XML just makes interchange and
format specification easier, and the wide availability of XML
libraries makes creation of new tools simple. Moreover, looking at
these word processor formats has really helped me to see the
modularity benefits of namespaces -- when done correctly, namespaces
can leverage the work done by many groups of independent developers.</P>
<P>However, XML itself only goes so far. For example, Microsoft is
also moving towards an XML format for future versions of MS Word; but
in contrast to the openness of the OASIS/OpenOffice.org or AbiWord
formats, Microsoft is surrounding its format with patent
applications, and putting a veil of secrecy around the format
variations (plus it uses cryptic tag and attribute names rather than
self-documenting ones).</P>
<P>XML by itself does not really mean open, but fortunately, the
developers of KOffice, AbiWord, and OpenOffice.org have done a
generally wonderful job of obtaining openness with XML (albeit, the
wild world of community development still leaves occasional impedance
mismatches in, for example, DTDs).&quot;</P>

Comments/opinions reg. the OpenOffice.org 1.1 Competitive Guide</H2>
<P>&quot;1. Ease of Use</P>
<P>Due to OpenOffice.org's similarity to Microsoft Office most people
don't need a lot of retraining. Besides, there is a huge focus on
usability for the next major release. On the other hand,
OpenOffice.org has some superior tools and concepts like the built-in
one-click PDF export, the Navigator and the Stylist.</P>
<P>Recently a German computer magazine tested different word
processors  and came to the conclusion that OpenOffice.org and
StarOffice are  superior with respect to the creation of long
documents like a diploma thesis.</P>
<P>With respect to database support, OpenOffice.org provides a
powerful database frontend that can be used with many different
database systems in the backend. Besides, in many cases the migration
to a new desktop platform also turned out to be a good time to
consolidate the huge number of hard to maintain local MS Access
databases into one web based platform that uses a secure and
performant server database in the backend.</P>
<P>2. Tailored Solutions</P>
<P>Due to the fact that the source code of OpenOffice.org is
available for everybody and that the file format for all applications
is an open XML file format it is possible to create very tailored
solutions based on OpenOffice.org. A list of companies that have
already created innovative solutions based on OpenOffice.org can be
found on the OpenOffice.org developer web page at 
</P>
<P><A HREF="http://development.openoffice.org/">http://development.openoffice.org/</A>.</P>
<P>Integrations and integration prototypes from SAP, FileNet,
Software AG and others were demo'd at CeBIT (Hannover, Germany) last
week.</P>
<P>3. Support When Needed</P>
<P>Support for OpenOffice.org is available from large global
companies as well as a huge and fast growing number of small local
companies. 
</P>
<P>A list of companies providing support can be found at 
</P>
<P><A HREF="/support/index.html">/support/index.html</A>
z.B. StarOffice. 
</P>
<P>4. Better and Faster Work</P>
<P>Due to the fact that OpenOffice.org and StarOffice are used at
many  schools and universities less people need retraining simply
because  they have used OpenOffice.org or StarOffice right from the 
beginning. At the same time more and more software vendors are 
integrating their products with OpenOffice.org in order to simplify
collaboration. In addition, OpenOffice.org is available on all 
</P>
<P>major desktop platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and 
Solaris. This includes the open XML file format support.</P>
<P>5. Seamless Information Exchange</P>
<P>Not only does OpenOffice.org have quickly-improving import and
export filters for Microsoft Office, it also supports the creation of
popular exchange formats like PDF and Flash out of the box. In
addition, OpenOffice.org is available for many operating  systems and
languages. Recipients of an OpenOffice.org file can simply download
the latest version of the software for free in order to open and edit
the document. Thus, nobody is forced to buy expensive software.</P>
<P>For e-mail based collaboration and calendaring a growing list of
products is available including Mozilla, Evolution, Eudora, Glow and
others. On the server side there is again the choice between free
open source tools like OpenGroupware.org and commercial products like
the groupware products from Sun Microsystems and Novell.</P>
<P>6. Easier Deployment and Maintenance</P>
<P>OpenOffice.org allows an unattended installation via scripts
(so-called &quot;reponse files&quot;). In addition multiple vendors
provide deployment and mangement solutions for their  OpenOffice.org
based products. A few examples are the StarOffice  Configuration
Manager and the Sun Control Station as well as Novell's Red Carpet.
In order to minimize migration costs different companies including
SCAI and Sun Microsystems are working on migration tools.</P>
<P>7. Security</P>
<P>The virus issues of the last few months have clearly shown that
almost exclusively systems with Windows and MS Office were affected.
Although no operating system can guarantee invulnerability regarding
virusses, the combination of OpenOffice.org and a non-Windows
operating systems has proven to be very secure.</P>
<P>8. Investment You Can Trust</P>
<P>The OpenOffice.org file format is the basis of the OASIS Open XML
File Format which will be used as the default file format in future
versions of OpenOffice.org. Therefore, the file format is controlled
by a standards body instead of a single vendor. In addition, the
availablity of the source code in connection with strong support
through the OpenOffice.org community and companies like Sun
Microsystems ensure ongoing innovation and improvement.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Some pundits, including Gartner Dataquest&rsquo;s Michael
Silver, say that one key to the success of StarOffice 7--now
available in Linux, Windows and Solaris flavors--is its open XML file
structure. Many widely available XML tools--from Sun or not-- can be
used to edit files. Plus, it has an inexpensive price tag. Those
factors together, he told internetnews.com, could translate into a
10% chunk taken from Microsoft&rsquo;s currentdominance in the market

<P>&quot;India's second largest insurer, United India Insurance
Company, is moving 10,000 desktops to Sun Microsystems' office suite
StarOffice.</P>
<P>A media release from Sun quoted UIIC's IT assistant general
manager S.M. Victor John as saying the insurer had selected
StarOffice 7 software because it matched the company's technical
specifications and was competitively priced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A Sun spokesperson said the 10,000 desktops being replaced
were running mostly Office 95. &quot;One of the reasons why UIIC
chose StarOffice is due to cost savings. StarOffice only costs
anywhere from $25-$60 for enterprises while Microsoft Office sells
their Office suite for hundreds of dollars,&quot; the spokesperson
said.</P>
<P>&quot;StarOffice's functionality and compatibility to Microsoft
Office was also a major factor in the decision as well as
multi-platform support - Linux, Solaris, Windows - for greater
flexibility and choice.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Can Sun Microsystems' StarOffice 7 supplant Microsoft Office
on your desktop? With previous versions being slow and buggy, you'd
probably answer no. But the speed, power, and simplicity of the
latest version&mdash;combined with its minuscule price ($79.95
direct)&mdash;may change your mind. It's certainly worth a look for
budget-constrained government or enterprise buyers, as well as small
businesses and individual users who need to buy an office suite with
their own money. And attention education buyers: Sun will send you
the software for just the cost of the media and shipping.&quot;</P>

<P>The adoption of OpenOffice by the government has already raised
interest in the software among Israelis, including those who normally
aren't interested in technology, said Shoshannah Forbes, who works as
a software tester for OpenOffice.org, the organization that develops
the open-source program.</P>
<P>Microsoft software is very expensive in Israel, and interest in
OpenOffice is such that Forbes has been asked about it by complete
strangers in her local video store, she said. &quot;I was asked where
I worked, and when I said I worked for OpenOffice, everyone was
asking about it. It's been all over the press here.&quot; &quot;</P>

Kinko and OpenOffice.org</H2>
<P>&quot;While I was helping out a friend with her Linux install she
related to me how OOo &quot;saved her bacon&quot; recently.</P>
<P>She had been working on a brochure for a local library that needed
to be printed in a number of different languages including chinese,
hindi, and arabic.  She had prepared the document in Word and took
the file to Kinko's (a copy shop) for printing.  They did not have
the fonts to print out the non-western characters.  She rushed back
to her house and opened up the document in OpenOffice.org 1.1.  With
some minor reformatting she saved the file as a PDF which she took
back to Kinko's.  They were able to complete the printing job from
the pdf.</P>
<P>I've asked her to write this up and submit it to OOo as a
testimonial. Where or whom should it go to?</P>
<P>PS - She likes OOo and uses Calc and the dbase function to help
run her business.  She uses Word only because she needed a good
thesaurus, which OOo lacks.  If the thesaurus was better she'd stop
using Word altogether.  If she didn't need to use Word she said she
wouldn't need to use Windows either.</P>
<P>PPS - For those who don't know, the term &quot;saving one's bacon&quot;
has nothing to do with hogs or pork products.&quot;</P>

Vietnam embracing open-source products</H2>
<P>&quot;The main open-source tools are Linux -- a free alternative
to the Windows operating system -- and OpenOffice, a free alternative
to Microsoft Office, with word processing and spreadsheet programs.
Two Vietnamese companies have recently developed Vietnamese versions
of both, and the country's two biggest computer assemblers are
already loading open source onto all their new machines.</P>
<P>``We can't totally sweep out Microsoft,'' Quynh said. ``But we
hope that new users will start using open source.''</P>
<P>Before Vietnamese versions of OpenOffice and Linux were developed,
open source was just an abstraction here, said Carrasco-Munoz. ``Now
you dump this CD on your computer, you install it, you reboot.
Bye-bye Microsoft!''&quot;</P>

Australia's history archived in OpenOffice.org</H2>
<P>&quot;Australia's history will be viewed digitally in the
OpenOffice.org office suite as part of plans to preserve the quality
and accessibility of government documents.</P>
<P>[...]</P>
<P>&quot;Open source is really, really important to us because over
time it means we can retain data presentation,&quot; said Davis.</P>
<P>&quot;Cross platform development is really important, because we
can't say you must have a Windows machine to access this file [in the
archives]. Who knows what platform most people will be using in 30
years time? So if you have a Linux machine, for example, you should
have equal access.&quot;&quot;</P>

The IDA Open Source Migration Guidelines</H2>
<P>&quot;The IDA Open Source Migration Guidelines provide practical
and detailed recommendations on how to migrate to Open Source
Software (OSS)-based office applications, calendaring, e-mail and
other standard applications. They have been developed with guidance
from public sector IT experts from Denmark, Finland, Italy, Germany,
Malta, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey. The relevance and
readability of the Migration Guidelines were validated with the help
of the regional authorities of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.</P>
<P>These guidelines have been designed to help public administrators
decide whether a migration to OSS should be undertaken and describe,
in broad technical terms, how such a migration could be carried out.
They are based on practical experience of a limited number of
publicly available case studies, and cover a wide range of management
and technical concerns.&quot;</P>

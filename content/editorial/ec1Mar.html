<P><b>Interview: Sander Vesik</b></P>
<P> </P>
<P>Over the course of two days, I interviewed OpenOffice.org&#146;s release engineer, 
  Sander Vesik. As the release engineer, Sander works with Armin Theissen in Sun's 
  offices in Ireland to coordinate releases of OpenOffice.org builds. I initially 
  planned for this interview to go into the &quot;Spotlight&quot; section of the 
  OpenOffice.org home page. But because Sander raises some important points about 
  Open Source that transcend the more biographical nature of the spotlight, I 
  feel that this space is more appropriate. </P>
<P>As always, please feel free to contribute your responses to the OpenOffice.org 
  &quot;<a href="//mail_list.html">discuss</a>&quot; list.

  <a href="mailto:louis@openoffice.org">Louis</a>.<I></i></P>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><I><B>Every open-source project has its own defining characteristics. What 
  characteristics about OpenOffice.org drew you to it? </B></i> </p>
<P>I actually worked at Sun before October 13th [2000] when the site (and project), 
  as far as source code is concerned, was launched. But in general I guess it 
  was the name recognition of 'StarOffice' and its potential [that drew me]. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><i><B>How would you describe your role in OpenOffice.org? </B></i></P> 
<P>Imagine taking one of the great pyramids, say the Pyramid of Cheops, and removing 
  all but, oh, 20 randomly selected stone blocks. You could probably think of 
  a wide variety of shapes based on just those 20 stones and the position of the 
  stones in the structure might thus considerably vary. It's really hard to say 
  at this point where I am going to be in the OpenOffice.org scheme of things 
  when they finally develop. I just hope the process does pick up some speed. 
  For now, I'm mostly a free-floating stone.</P>
<B><I> </i></B> 
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<I>
<P><b>It's difficult sometimes for those not familiar with the workings of an 
  open-source project to understand just how positions are established and defined&#133;. 
  </b> </P>
</I>
<P>OpenOffice.org isn't really an open-source project, and definitely not from 
  the developer base point of view, having only one non-Sun committer. Well, this 
  doesn't sound nice when taken on the face value. Yes, the code definitely is 
  free, but the developer community and structures associated with that just haven't 
  developed yet. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><i>What do you mean, then, by an open-source project? Is it the community 
  that makes the difference? For what you imply is that an open-source project 
  relies for its identity as such on community involvement. </i></B></P>
<P>There are a great number of shades of gray between 'totally Open Source' and 
  'closed source'. Somewhere in the spectrum are things like various FSF projects 
  [<a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a>], <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/source.html" target="_blank">Sun 
  JDK source</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/%7Eghost/" target="_blank">Ghostscript</a>,<a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank"> 
  Mozilla[.org]</a>, OpenOffice.org, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.kde.org/" target="_blank">KDE</a>, <a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_blank">Linux</a>, 
  and many others. [Whether] a project is open or not doesn't depend so much on 
  the license but how the whole project works. The license is only a small part 
  of that, and not always the most important. There are <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a>-licensed 
  projects that are really more closed than the JDK, [but] that also actively 
  kill forks.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> </P>
<I> 
<P><B>How would you go about making OpenOffice.org more of an open-source project? 
  That is, what needs still to be done? </B></P>
</i> 
<P>I really do think only new people coming to the project and actively throwing 
  their weight behind the project can do that. So far, this has only really happened 
  in porting.</P>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>How would you recommend a new community member should go about joining 
  a project? </b></i></p>
<p>It really depends on the project, but I think in general [that they could] 
  start [by] asking questions, finding stuff out on [their] own (and [requesting] 
  documentation for the uncovered parts), and making patches that fix bugs or 
  add new functionality. Oh and not going away just because it seems nobody is 
  paying attention and answering back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<I>
<P><B>For prospective members, what elements about OpenOffice.org might appeal 
  to them? </B></P>
</i> 
<P>Availability of regular binary snapshots, a wide variety of not yet filled 
  roles, [and] having what you do actually go to the desktops of a large number 
  of users on several platforms.</P>

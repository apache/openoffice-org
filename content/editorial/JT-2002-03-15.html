<p>I am surprised that I have not seen any discussion of the CNET article: &quot;<a href="http://news.com.com/2009-1017-857509.html">New 
  Windows could solve age-old format puzzle--at a price</a>&quot;, which is posted 
  on the CNET News.com site.</p>
<p>
It talks about replacing Microsoft's &quot;antiquated file system with modern 
database technology&quot; which will &quot;mean easier, faster and more reliable 
searches for information&quot;.<p>
The sidebar to the article says: &quot;Microsoft is replacing the plumbing of 
its Windows operating system with technology borrowed from its SQL Server database 
software. Currently, documents, Web pages, e-mail files, spreadsheets and other 
information are stored in separate, mostly incompatible software. The new technology 
will unify storage in a single database built into Windows that's more easily 
searchable, more reliable, and accessible across corporate networks and the Internet.&quot;<p>
So - Microsoft wants to get rid of application files and store everything in a 
database. How convenient.<p>
It is a brilliant strategic move. After all, Microsoft users are not 'chained 
down' by their loyalty to Windows - they are chained down by their loyalty to 
their most heavily used Office applications - principally Word and Excel.<p>
Openoffice.org hopes to win these users over, but to do so we rely on the critical 
interoperability provided by our import/export filters. I personally have been 
writing letters to antitrust officials begging them to force Microsoft to publish 
the specifications of the file formats for their Office applications. Such publication 
would just about completely level the playing field, and allow users to use whichever 
office productivity applications they like. This in turn would give people much 
more flexibility in choosing operating systems.<p>
But just think - what if there were no file formats to publish? 'Sorry judge, 
we would like to - but the data is not stored in files. It is stored in a database 
that is an indivisible part of the operating system.'<p>
The database records will of course be totally inaccessible to any program other 
than the application that stored them - for security reasons. Throw in some encryption, 
and if Microsoft is really smart, a patented API by which applications read/write 
to/from the datastore - and interoperability with other office applications will 
become a priori impossible.<p>
People will still need to collaborate on documents of course (that is, to exchange 
'files'). But the documents will simply move (via .NET) from the datastore buried 
deep in the guts of a Windows OS running on one computer, to a datastore embedded 
in a MS OS running on another computer. Microsoft will gradually make the whole 
thing more and more opaque ... to the point at which people will not even think 
of files anymore. The concept of 'files' may be something that is taught to our 
great grandchildren in history class.<p>
While the US Department of Justice is busy conceding the last war - the one in 
which Microsoft 'integrated' Internet Explorer in the operating system - Microsoft 
is moving its battalions ahead to win the coming war.<p>
The CNET article, to which I referred, says that Microsoft is hard at work on 
this new 'storage technology' - and the breathless tone of the article indicates 
that Microsoft is hard at work selling the concept and all of its 'benefits' to 
the public.<p>
We shouldn't underestimate the cunning of Microsoft's strategy of integrating 
more and more functionality into the operating system. Combined with an opaque 
OS hosted datastore and .NET - this strategy could allow Microsoft to achieve 
a critical mass of proprietary interconnections which could quickly grow to be 
completely unassailable.

<h2>Newsletter 4: Marketing </h2>
<p>2002-03-05</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketing would seem antithetical to <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open 
  Source</a> but it isn't. In fact, Open Source is itself a kind of marketing 
  strategy. Yet skeptics abound, as a recent <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/03/01/1555254&mode=thread">article</a> 
  suggesting Linux could do with marketing indicates. But OpenOffice.org is way 
  ahead of them. Our <a href="http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/marketing/">Marketing 
  Project</a> was created by <a href="http://whiteboard.openoffice.org/servlets/BrowseList?listName=marketing&by=thread&from=3449">community 
  members six months</a> ago and is now one of the most active and popular projects 
  and includes people from all corners of the world interested in making OpenOffice.org 
  succeed.</p>
<p>And it needs you. As project co-lead Josh Berkus has <a href="//servlets/ReadMsg?msgId=233819&listName=discuss">signaled</a> 
  to the OpenOffice.org <a href="mailto:users@openoffice.apache.org">discuss</a> mailing 
  list, the Marketing Project needs people--regular endusers as well as developers--to 
  work together to get the word out about OpenOffice.org, and especially OpenOffice.org 
  1.0. </p>
<p>Is this a one-time thing? We think not. Rather, it seems that marketing an 
  Open Source project, especially OpenOffice.org, is here to stay. Why? because 
  although we might expect Open Source technology to spread by example, it is 
  only by being coordinated and logical in our endeavors that we can hope to attract 
  governments, corporations, and universities. Otherwise, they may dally with 
  it--but be persuaded by the FUD generated by Redmond, and by the general apprehension 
  over things truly democratic. </p>
<p>So consider helping out as best you can, even if--especially if!--that best 
  is reading over and correcting documents and press releases. </p>

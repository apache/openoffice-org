<h2> Spotlight: On Developers 
  and Technology </h2>

<P><b>Mission Statement</b></P>
<p>The work of composing our Mission Statement, which you can see near the <a href="#mission">top</a> of the page, involved the community in the &#147;<a href="//www-discuss/current/">discuss</a>&#148; mailing list as few other issues have. The reason: A project&#146;s mission statement is crucially important for defining both the identity of the project and of the community that makes that project a reality. This is even more so when the project is Open Source. Then, it needs the focus only a mission statement that clearly articulates the community's goals can provide. And our mission statement, which emphasizes the community's role in creating the product and specifies some of the technology to be used, accomplishes these goals as probably no other mission statement does.</P>

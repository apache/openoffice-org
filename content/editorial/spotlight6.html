<h2> Spotlight: On Developers and Technology</h2><br>

<p><b>Building Momentum.</b></p>
<p>The last ten days of April have seen unprecedented activity throughout the 
  site. In no small part, that activity is due to the nearly simultaneous release 
  of the <a href=//dev_docs/source/download.html>625 build</a>, 
  news of the <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/mac" target="_blank">Mac 
  OS X port</a>, and the advent of our new <a href="http://distribution.openoffice.org/mirrors/">mirrors</a>. 
  Discussion in the general <a href="//servlets/SummarizeList?listName=discuss">discuss 
  forum</a> has touched on a variety of subjects related to using the new build 
  and to considerations regarding the configuration of the software. For the more 
  technically sophisticated, the <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=dev">porting 
  forum</a> has proved lively and interesting. </p>

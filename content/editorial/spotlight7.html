<h2> Spotlight: On Developers 
  and Technology </h2>
<h4><br>
  Spotlight 7</h4>
<P><b>Porting and Building</b>

<p>Slightly less than seven months have passed since the inaugural release of OpenOffice.org code, on <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-10-13-002-21-NW-DT-SW" target="_blank">October 13, 2000</a>. A short time, perhaps, but a period that has seen the birth and growth of a community dedicated to creating software that serves the needs of everyone. And the forums reflect that. Of the debates and discussions in the <a href="//www-discuss/current/">discuss forum,</a> which deals with more general issues, perhaps the most interesting has been the thread relating to the <a href="//www-discuss/current/msg03322.html" target="_blank">raison d'&ecirc;tre of OpenOffice.org.</a> And in the more specific forums, such as <a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/tools-dev/" target="_blank">"Build Tools,"</a> which focuses on issues related to building the software, or <a href="http://porting.openoffice.org/porting-dev/" target="_blank">Porting</a>, discussions and debates have been extremely lively and very productive, both for the project software and the development of the community. </body>

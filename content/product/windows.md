## Windows Version Support

The current Apache OpenOffice supports Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.

Specific platform version notes:

  - **Windows 2000**: OpenOffice may work on Windows 2000, but we don't test or recommend it.
  - **Windows XP**: Tested, stable, no platform-specific problems known.
  - **Windows Vista**: Tested, stable, no platform-specific problems known.
  - **Windows 7**: Tested, stable.
  - **Windows 8**: We run as a "desktop application", not a Metro "App". Requires x86 or 64-bit Windows. 
    We do not support Windows RT, the ARM-based version, intended for tablets.

**Please note**: Apache OpenOffice is distributed as a 32-bit application. It will run successfully in
32-bit mode on 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8. But in those cases a 32-bit JVM is required
for some functionality. Details are 
[here](http://www.openoffice.org/download/common/java.html).


## Hardware Requirements

Hardware demands are quite modest and even older machines should be able to run OpenOffice:

  - **Memory**: Minimum 256 Mbytes RAM (512 MB RAM recommended).
  - **Storage**: At least 650 Mbytes available disk space for a default install via download. After installation and deletion of temporary installation files, Apache OpenOffice will use approximately 440 Mbytes disk space.
  - **Graphics**: 1024 x 768 or higher resolution with at least 256 colours.

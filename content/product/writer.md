*Letting you concentrate on writing your ideas*

**Writer** has everything you would expect from a modern, fully equipped word
processor.

It is simple enough for a quick memo, yet powerful enough to create complete books
with contents, diagrams, indexes, etc. You're free to concentrate on your
ideas while Writer makes them look great.

*Wizards* take all the hassle out of producing standard documents such as
letters, faxes, agendas, minutes, or carrying out more complex tasks such as
mail merges. Of course, you are also free to create your own templates, or
[download templates][1] from our Templates repository.

*Styles and Formatting* puts the power of style sheets into the hands of every
user.

*AutoCorrect dictionary* can trap typing mistakes on the fly, 
checking your spelling as you type. Writer can handle the use of different languages in your
document too.

*AutoComplete* reduces typing effort, it will suggest common words and
phrases to complete what you are typing.

*Text frames* and *linking* give you the power to tackle desktop publishing
tasks for newsletters, flyers, etc. laid out exactly the way you want them to
be.

*Table of Contents &amp; References* - Increase the usefulness of your long, complex documents 
by generating a table of contents or indexing terms, bibliographical references, illustrations, 
tables, and other objects.

*Multi-page display* - Writer can also display multiple pages while you edit - ideal for complex
documents. Works well with large and multiple monitors.

*Notes* - The notes feature displays notes and comments on the side of the document. This
makes notes a lot easier to read. In addition, notes from different users are
displayed in different colors together with the editing date and time.

*HTML, PDF, MediaWiki formats* - Make your documents freely available with Writer's HTML export to the web,
or export in MediaWiki format for publishing to wikis. Publish in Portable
Document Format (.pdf) to guarantee that what you write is what your reader
sees. The PDF export feature in Apache OpenOffice provides a huge set of formatting
and security options; so that PDF files can be customized for many different
scenarios, including ISO standard PDF/A files.

*.odt Standard* - Save your documents in OpenDocument format, the new international standard for
office documents. This XML based format means you're not tied in to Writer.
You can access your documents from any OpenDocument compliant software.

*.docx &amp; .doc support* - Writer can of course read all your older Microsoft Word documents, or save
your work in Microsoft Word format for sending to people who are still using
Microsoft products. Writer can also open .docx files created with Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac OS X.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="4"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The difficulty in supporting formula conversion
from xml in StarOffice to binary equivalents in Excel comes from the fact
that there are very basic differences between the two formats. Pocket Excel
uses obviously binary records to store formula, StarOffice uses a String.
In the case of Pocket Excel, postfix (Reverse Polish) notation is used and
in StarOffice the formula is stored infix notation. This means that we must
identify the operators and operands (as well as functions) in the formula
in order to convert from one notation to another. This process we call parsing
and in many ways is similar to what a compiler does when interpreting source
code. The next step is to convert to and from postfix notation. This can
be done in three  ways using either stacks, binary trees or combinations
of both. Once this has been done all that remains is token substitution where
a String is converted to or from a series of bytes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="4"><b>The Issues</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Parsing</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Parsing is the first operation to be performed
on any formula encountered in either Pocket Excel or StarOffice. Parsing
is the single most important aspect of formula conversion because all tokens
must be correctly identified in order for the following two steps to be successful.
The parser must be able to correctly identify operators, operands. Operands
in there simplest terms consist of either a numeric value or a cell reference.
Operators include binary operators (+,-,*,/) or unary operators(-). These
are the simplest as</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">the operands are easily identified. A more
complicated type of operator however is the function. These are more difficult
as they can contain any number of parameters. The parameters can be of almost
any type, numeric, cell references, cell ranges, or other functions. Consider
the following formula :-</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=SUM(AA11:AA22, 1000, C3+4, AVERAGE(D44:D55))</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is a valid formula and the parser needs
to be able to identify each token</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">in order for the RPN conversion to be correctly
completed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>Pocket Excel Formula Parsing</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In the case of pocket excel the formula must
be parsed from a series of bytes in postfix (Reverse Polish) notation to
a string in infix notation. This is not really a parser as we simply convert
the bytes to their equivalent string representations. Tokens in this way
can easily be identified and no lexical scanning is required. Postfix notation
does not have to concern itself with operator precedence or parenthesis hence
this must be taken care of during paring. For example consider the following
postfix statement </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=AB+C*</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This would be translated to infix notation
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=A+B*C</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">However because of operator precedence it
is required the we used parenthesis</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">to ensure that it is calculated in the right
order.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=(A+B)*C</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>StarCalc Formula Parsing</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In the case of StarOffice formula Parsing
the formula must be parsed from a String to a series of bytes. Again operators
precedence is important along with the use of parenthesis. Also the parser
must have the ability to parse nested functions and complex arguments (eg.
=A1*3-(SUM(C1:A1, D1+40, AVERAGE(D2:D5))) ).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>RPN Conversion</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Consider the formula </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">SUM(A1, A2, 3+4*SUM(B3:B9),D1)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">this notation is called infix and is the one
that is used in StarCalc. However in Pocket Excel this formula would appear
in postfix notation (also called Reverse Polish)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">A1 A2 3 4  B3:B9 SUM * + D1 SUM</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">There are two ways in which postfix can be
converted from/to infix. One is to use a Binary tree and read the tree from
right to left to get postfix and from left to right to get infix. The problem
with this method is it doesn't take into account functions which can have
more than two parameters. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The other way of implementing conversion is
to use Stacks. This solves the problem of function parameters but the code
is more complex. For example in order to take into account that natural operator
precedence might be overruled by parenthesis the Stack method will need to
take into account parenthesis (possibly nested). </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Token substitution</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Token substitution must take account of the
different ways in which data is stored in each format. For example in StarOffice
cell references are stored as Strings in the same way as they appear in the
spreadsheet (e.g. A12, C23, B4:B12). However in Pocket Excel Cell references
are stored as 0 based indexes so A1 is represented in binary as</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C0&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 00</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Cell Ref.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Row	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Column (bits 0-7)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is just a substitution for a simple cell
reference. There are other types of cell references, cell ranges and functions.
This needs to well designed code as it will need to be expanded as additional
features are supported. Also due to the large amount of objects it is not
practical to have an object for each operator and operand. Obviously token
substitution needs to be supported in both directions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><font size="4"><b>Proposed Solution</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Parsing</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">We have written a top-down parser that will
be able to handle infix to postfix parsing with one addition. This  addition
is handling parameters within functions.  This is not a trivial addition
as there can be any number of parameters and the parameters themselves can
be any combination of cell references, cell ranges, functions or other formula.
The BNF notation for this parser is</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;unary op&gt;
&lt;term&gt; [&lt;addop&gt; &lt;term&gt;]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>&lt;term&gt;       ::= &lt;factor&gt; [&lt;mulop&gt;
factor]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>&lt;factor&gt;     ::= &lt;integer&gt; |
&lt;variable&gt; | &lt;expression&gt; | &lt;function&gt;</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>&lt;function&gt; ::= &lt;ident&gt; [ &lt;expression&gt;
]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Parsing from postfix to infix is made simpler
by the fact that we will be reading in a series of bytes which will give
the  exact content of each token. In this case what is required is a converter
as opposed to a parser. This will generate a series of objects (see token
substitution) which are passed to the RPN converter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>RPN Conversion</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In order to overcome the problem with Binary
trees and function parameters we have decided to write a Stack implementation.
This means the code to implement this is more complicated but is flexible
enough to handle most formula.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>From Infix to Postfix</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In this case we push operators on to a Stack.
When we come across an operator we check for precedence with the next operand
and if it is greater we also push this onto the stack.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=A1+SUM(3*B1+4, C1)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">First token is A1 which we put 	into our
output string</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">the next token is + which we push 	on
the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next token is the function SUM 	with
two arguments which again is an operator which we put on the 	stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Next is 3 which as an operand we 	put
in the output string  	</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Next is * which goes on the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">B1 is an operand we put in the 	output
string  	</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">+ but this has less precedence so 	we
pop * off the stack  into the output string and + goes on the 	stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">4 operand in the output strings</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><i>From Postfix to Infix</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">From postfix to infix we again use stack.
In this case however we use it as a temporary storage space for operands.
We push operands onto the stack and when we come across a operator we pop
the operands off the stack and use them as operands for that operator. If
the completed statement is a parameter to a function it needs to be pushed
back onto the stack and the remainder of the function parsed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=A1 A2 3 4 B3:B9 SUM * + D1 SUM 3 +</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">First token A1 is an operand it 	goes
on the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">next is A2 again on the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">next is 3 again on the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">next is 4 again on the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">next is B3:B9 again on the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">next is SUM with 1 argument so pop 	one
operand off the stack B3:B9 and insert it into the SUM function</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next is a * operator so we 	prepend
that to the SUM statement and pop another operand 4 off the 	stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next is a + operator so we 	prepend
that to the SUM statement and pop another operand 3 off the 	stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next is another operand so 	know that
parameter is finished so we push it onto the stack and 	then push D1 onto
the stack as well.</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next is SUM with 3 arguments 	so we
pop 3 arguments of the stack</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The next is an operand so we know 	to
push the statement completed in the last step needs to be pushed 	onto the
stack and then we push on  3 as well</p>
	</li>
  <li>         
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">the last token is a plus so we end 	up
with</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">=SUM(A1, A2, 3+4*SUM(BS:B9), D1)+3</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">  </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Token Substitution</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The best solution is to use generic objects
for tokens. We will have two basic object classes. One called OperatorToken
and one called OperandToken. Each of these will have a value variable as
well as type. The type will describe forms of an operator or operand e.g.
+ , A1, SUM(). The parser will parse a string or a series of bytes into a
Vector of these objects which will be used by the RPN converter to convert
to or from postfix notation. These classes will be derived from a Token interface
to facilitate this. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">We will also have to describe a Constants
interface to describe the various hex codes that exist for each object. One
area we have not decided what to do yet is converting to or from bytes. Obviously
we need a separate one for each operator but it is not practical to have
one object  for each operator.</p>

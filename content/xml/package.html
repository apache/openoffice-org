<H1>XML Packages</H1>
<H2>Purpose of this document</H2>
<P>At the end of September, I (<I>dvo</I>) have asked the
openoffice.org community for help on the problem of embedding binary
content in XML documents. This page is intended to summarize the
discussion and provide a solid foundation that will guide our
implementation efforts. 
</P>
<P>We will first restate the problem. Then follows a summary of the
requirements that have been stated in the <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/www-discuss/">discuss</A>
and <A HREF="http://xml.openoffice.org/xml-dev/">xml-dev</A> mailing
lists. The candidate solutions mentioned on the mailing lists are
then examined in light of these requirements. Finally, a conclusion
is presented. 
</P>
<H3>A few definitions</H3>
<P>To clarify the following discussion, a definition of a few terms
for use within this document may be in order: 
</P>
<DL>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">document 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	A document comprises everything a user considers to part of his
	text, spreadsheet or presentation. In general this will include
	several images or OLE objects in addition to the main content. 
	</DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	If images are linked into the document, they are not considered part
	of it. Whether an image is linked or embedded into the document is
	determined by the user. Due to limitations in the current OLE
	handling, OLE objects must always be embedded. 
	</DD><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	file 
	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	A file is a sequence of bytes as stored in the operating system's
	file system. This fairly obvious definition serves to distinguish
	between the logical view (the document) and the physical view (the
	file). 
	</DD><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">

	</DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	A subdocument refers to an individual component of the document.

	The main document content refers to the subdocument that best

	form the main document content. 
	</DD></DL>
<H2>
The Problem</H2>
<P>OpenOffice and the next generation of StarOffice by default use an
XML based file format (but the user may choose to save in a different
format). Therefore this project differs from many others, as this is
an XML based file format intended to be truly a format for the
masses. The requirements for a native file format are different
(usually more demanding) than those for an interchange format. 
</P>
<P>XML is meant for structured content and has no native support for
binary objects (BLOBs) such as images, OLE objects or other media
types. Since embedding of binary objects is needed for office
documents, a way to handle XML and binary data in the same document
must be provided. 
</P>
<P>One solution may be to simply store the XML data in a file and
link to image data in separate files, much like in HTML documents.
While linking files at the user's request should be possible, this is
in general not considered adequate for office documents. A document
should be stored in a single file to make external handling of the
document (e.g. copying the document) possible. Therefore, binary
content must be stored in the same file as the XML content, requiring
either a <EM>package</EM> format or a means to encode binary content
in XML. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to all solutions
that store XML and BLOB data in a single file as packages. 
</P>
<H2>The Requirements</H2>
<P>The following requirements have been identified for the package
format: 
</P>
<H3>A. Efficient Operation</H3>
<P>Users have traditionally required efficient operation, especially
for basic functionality such as loading or saving of documents. It is
our experience that independent loading (or saving) of subdocuments
is the key to efficient handling of large documents. Additionally,
users require that disk space is used efficiently. This leads us to
require the document format to support: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">small file sizes 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">on-demand loading (i.e.,
	independent loading of subdocuments) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>independent saving of subdocuments 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>These requirements are strongly supported by ten years of
experience at StarOffice. Failing to meet these requirements has
repeatedly resulted in dissatisfaction and significant protests from
the user base. 
</P>
<P><B>Note</B> on independent saving of subdocuments: Previous
versions of StarOffice have gotten significant benefit from copying
subdocuments on the file system level rather than reading and then
writing subdocuments through the <A HREF="http://ucb.openoffice.org/">UCB</A>.
This should be supported by the package format. Saving modified
subdocuments into an existing (compound) document may provide further
benefits. 
</P>
<H3>B. Compatibility with Existing Tools</H3>
<P>A primary motivation for creating an XML based file format is the
ability to process, create and manipulate StarOffice documents with
external tools. To deserve the label &quot;open&quot; document
format, these tools should be standard and widely available. As far
as possible, this should apply to both, the document and the
individual subdocuments (if applicable). In particular, the main
document content (using XML) should be accessible to standard XML
tools. 
</P>
<P>This leads us to state three subrequirements: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Subdocuments should be usable with
	standard tools. In particular, XML subdocuments should be usable
	with standard XML tools, e.g. XSLT transformations. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The document should be accessible
	with standard tools, making it possible to insert, modify and
	extract subdocuments, e.g. similar to zip or other popular
	archivers. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The document should be accessible with ASCII-based tools,
	e.g. the Windows file find function. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P><B>Note:</B> During discussion on openoffice.org mailing lists
several people preferred requirement number 1 to be extended to the
complete document. This would essentially require the document format
to be XML as well, with subdocuments (including BLOBS) being embedded
within the XML structure. 
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> Since XML is based on Unicode, ASCII based tools
cannot generally be assumed to work on XML files. Thus, no solution
will be able to fully support the third requirement. If UTF-8
encoding is used, ASCII-based tools will work at least for those
languages that can be properly represented in ASCII, like English or
Latin. 
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> Compression interferes with some of the requirements
above. The discussion on the mailing list has clearly proven that
those requirements are very important to some users. To support these
users, 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">compression should be made
	optional, and 
	</P>
	<LI><P>an additional implementation that writes pure XML (and saves
	binary data into separate files) should be created. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>Formats supporting compression on a per subdocument basis would
have an additional advantage in this respect. Also, this would allow
a subdocument with e.g. meta information (title, keywords, etc.) to
be stored uncompressed, making it more easily accessible. 
</P>
<H3>C. Security</H3>
<P>An additional advantage that may be gained through the use of a
package is easy support for document security. We can distinguish
between two security considerations: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">privacy: be able to encrypt
	(partial) documents 
	</P>
	<LI><P>integrity: be able to verify origin of (partial) documents 
	</P>
</OL>
<P><B>Note:</B> These requirements are of fairly low priority. 
</P>
<H3>D. Additional Issues</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P>A package structure supporting documents and subdocuments
	makes it easy to add additional information to a document, even if
	the reference implementation does not understand it. For example, in
	situations where a certain transformation is used very often, the
	transformation result may be stored in the package as well. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The current implementation is based on the SAX API. XML
	filters (transformations) also using the SAX API can be pipelined,
	e.g. they can import (or export) data into (or from) OpenOffice by
	going directly through the API, rather than going through a file. 
	</P>
</OL>
<H2>The Contenders</H2>
<P>On the openoffice.org mailing lists, the following possible
solutions were suggested: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">ZIP or JAR files 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">XML with binary data being
	ASCII-encoded within special tags (e.g. base64) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">MIME files 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">.tgz files 
	</P>
	<LI><P>BONOBO libefs 
	</P>
</OL>
<P><B>Note:</B> The participants quickly focused on two choices: JAR
and XML 
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> ZIP and JAR files are identical for most intents and
purposes. JAR differs from the older ZIP in the file ending, as well
as in additional meta information stored in a directory called
META-INF. JAR files can be accessed using unmodified ZIP tools. 
</P>
<H2>Examination of the contenders</H2>
<P>This chapter gives an overview of how well the various contenders
met the specified requirements. It was my (<I>dvo</I>) impression
that most people would agree on the suitability of the various
contenders for the various requirements. The disagreement was mainly
between the importance of the requirements. 
</P>
<P>In particular one group valued accessibility with XML tools (B1)
very high and consequently would speak for XML with base64 encoding,
while most others would prefer ZIP/JAR. 
</P>
<H3>ZIP / JAR</H3>
<P>Tools to create and manipulate ZIP files are widely available on
all platforms. The manifest file used with JAR files is usually
considered optional and may even be created using a text editor.
Access to subdocuments requires unzipping the required subdocuments
first. ASCII based tools will in general not work on the package,
although (at the user's request) individual subdocuments could be
stored uncompressed, thus making them available to ASCII based tools.</P>
<P>Since ZIP files have an index, efficient on-demand loading of
subdocuments can be achieved. Subdocuments can be copied from one
package to another without uncompressing and compressing them first.
With some hackery for on-demand saving, only those files following
the newly-written subdocuments need to be written. Due to (optional)
compression, files can be small, although not quite as small as .tgz
files. 
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> As requested on the mailing list, the JAR manifest
file should be replaced by an XML-based manifest file. The older JAR
manifest may be supported for compatibility reasons. This is to be
determined.

<H3>XML + base64</H3>
<P>This suggestion is to use plain XML documents and embed binary
content as base64 encoded ASCII in special elements. 
</P>
<P>Tools to generate or manipulate subdocuments in this format are
not commonly available, but could be written with reasonable effort.
Usability of the main document content with XML tools is, of course,
excellent. ASCII based tools should work with no problems (except for
the already mentioned UTF encodings). 
</P>
<P>Without an index, on-demand loading is not possible, neither is
on-demand saving. Files are not compressed and binary subdocuments
are even expand by 33% due to the base64 encoding. 
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> In the discussion lists, several remedies to allow
on-demand reading were suggested. Either the inclusion of indices in
the XML file, or placing the binary data at the end of the file. The
former was considered to be non-XML (as it relies on the physical
layout of the XML data) and useless, since any standard XML tool
would not update the index and thus OpenOffice couldn't rely on it.
The latter can not be done with standard (e.g. SAX-based) parsers, as
they are used in the current implementation. The SAX API is necessary
for the filter pipelining mentioned in the requirements section, so
forgoing SAX may have significant drawbacks.

<H3>MIME</H3>
<P>MIME is the established packaging format for emails. As is
required for SMTP compatibility, it is ASCII-based (7bit ASCII).
Non-Mailer tools to manipulate MIME files are rare. 
</P>
<P>Being an ASCII based format, accessibility to ASCII based tools is
excellent. However, the encoding of non-ASCII characters is solved
differently than in XML. Tools to manipulate MIME files (outside of
mail programs) are not readily available, but could be written with
reasonable effort. Access with XML tools requires unpacking first,
but as said before the tools to do so are not currently available. 
</P>
<P>MIME has no index of subdocuments, making on-demand loading
difficult. For saving of individual subdocuments, a reasoning similar
to ZIP files applies. However, copying subdocuments requires
accessing them, which is slow on MIME due to the lack of an index.
Since no compression is used, files get fairly large. In addition,
binary documents are usually encoded in base64, enlarging them by
33%.

<H3>.tgz</H3>
<P>The .tgz format (tar files compressed with gzip) is the most
popular archiving format on the UNIX platform. Tools to manipulate
.tgz files exist on most other platforms as well. As participants on
the mailing lists mentioned, it is used as package format for
KOffice. 
</P>
<P>.tgz operates according to the compress-after-packaging principle.
in general, this results in very good compression ratios. However,
the same principle causes on-demand loading of subdocument to be
severely inefficient: Not only is it impossible to quickly determine
the start position of subdocuments, it is also impossible to start
reading subdocuments once the start position is known because the
state of the uncompression tables cannot easily be reconstructed. For
the same reason, changing a subdocument or even copying subdocuments
is inefficient. 
</P>
<P>Availability of tools for manipulating .tgz files is good, and
even very good on UNIX platforms. Accessibility to subdocuments
requires unpacking the subdocuments first, which is slow because the
document must be uncompressed from the start.

<H3>Security</H3>
<P>Documents could of course be encrypted for all candidate formats.
All formats could encrypt subdocuments as well, except for
XML+base64, which would make it impossible to encrypt the main
document content without encrypting the binaries as well. In .tgz,
subdocument encryption could adversely affect compression, since the
entire file is compressed at once. 
</P>
<P>The same applies to file integrity verification. JAR is very
appealing in this regard, as it has already the full infrastructure
for subdocument and document integrity verification in place. 
</P>
<H2>The Conclusion</H2>
<P>The JAR file format seems to provide the best balance among the
stated requirements. Unlike all other formats, it does not have any
real weakness in regard to any of the requirements, and quite a lot
of advantages. 
</P>
<P>If one values accessibility with standard XML tools very high, XML
+ base64 seems a logical choice. While this is one of the
requirements for OpenOffice, the xmloff development team does not
follow the opinion that this single requirement significantly exceeds
all other requirements in importance. To accommodate this user base,
an additional pure XML file format with external subdocuments should
be created.

<H3>Remaining Issues</H3>

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Decide on meta information and
	manifest file format.

	<LI><P>Implement a UCB that allows pure XML documents.

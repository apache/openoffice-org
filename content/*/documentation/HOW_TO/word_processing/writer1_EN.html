<H3><a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction</H3>
 <P>This how-to presumes that the reader understands 
  some words commonly used in Office Automation applications, such as right and 
  left clicking, cursor, pop-up, and dialog window. The purpose of this document 
  is to explain how OOo Writer works, through some simple examples, of procedures 
  or tasks, needed to create a text document. All information presented here has 
  been tested on a Microsoft Windows version of the OOo Office Suite; nevertheless, 
  it is, in many cases, applicable to other platforms. </P>
 <P>Now, let's proceed to our first contact with Writer: 
  the OOo word processor.<BR>
  <BR>
</P>
<H4><a name="start"></a>1.1 Start it up!</H4>
 <P>After Writer has been started, by selecting Text 
  Document from the OOo group in the Start Menu on a Windows machine or by running 
  the soffice script on Linux, you should see a main window as shown below:</P>
 
<P><IMG SRC="writer_screenshot.GIF" NAME="Graphic1" ALT="Writer screenshot" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=512 HEIGHT=372 BORDER=0></P>
 <P>There are 5 visible bars:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P> the <B>Menu Bar </B>that lists commands in a menu style,</P>
  <LI> 
    <P>the <B>Function Bar 
      </B>that includes icons for common actions: open, save, copy, cut, paste, 
      etc.,</P>
  <LI> 
    <P>the <B>Command Bar 
      </B>with icons for formatting the text,</P>
  <LI> 
    <P>the <B>Main Toolbar, 
      </B>with specific tools used during the typing phase to insert fields, forms, 
      images, and other objects,</P>
  <LI> 
     <P>the <B>Status Bar</B> that displays information: 
      the current page, current template, zoom percentage, insert or overwrite 
      mode, selection mode, and hyperlink mode;</P>
</UL>
 <P>as well as 2 floating windows:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P>the <B>Stylist. U</B>sed 
      to change the style of the text with few clicks,</P>
  <LI> 
     <P>the<B> Navigator. </B>This tool is particularly 
      useful in long documents with many chapters, sections, images, etc. </P>
</UL>
 
<P>If the floating windows are not displayed by default, you can display them 
  by clicking on the <B>Navigator icon</B> <IMG SRC="navigator_icon.GIF" NAME="Graphic2" ALT="Navigator icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0> 
  and the <B>Stylist icon</B> <IMG SRC="stylist_icon.GIF" NAME="Graphic3" ALT="Stylist icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0> 
  that you find on the function bar. <BR>
</P>
 <P>Remember, whatever disaster you may cause in your 
  document, you are always able to Reload the last saved version via the File 
  menu, or to create a new blank one by the following:</P>
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P>type <B>CTRL+N</B> on your keyboard, (hold down the CTRL key and type N),</P>
  <LI> 
    <P>selecting <B>File-New-Text Document</B> from the Menu Bar, clicking on 
      the <B>New Document Icon <IMG SRC="new_document.GIF" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0> 
      </B>on the Function Bar.</P>
    
</OL>
 <P>Now, let's create a text document:</P>
 
<h3><BR>
  <A NAME="typing"></A>2. Typing and formatting in an OpenOffice.org text document.</h3>
<P>If you have worked with another word processor, 
  you will not have any problem learning the basic functions of OOo Writer. In 
  fact, many of the same actions and short-cuts are widely used in other Office 
  Suites. The document area where you type your text is defined with a thin gray 
  line, the text limit guide. These margins can be modified by:</P>
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P>clicking on the <B>Page Style icon</B> <IMG SRC="page_style_icon.GIF" NAME="Graphic5" ALT="Page Style icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0> 
      in the Stylist, </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>selecting and right 
      clicking on the <B>Default </B>style to display the context menu, </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>choosing <B>Modify... 
      </B>from the context menu to display the <B>Page Style Dialog Window,</B> 
    </P>
  <LI> 
     <P>setting the margins size in the <B>Page tab 
      </B>of the Page Style dialog. </P>
</OL>
 <P><B><I>Warning:</I> </B><I>Modifying the Default 
  page style means that every time you create a new document, your page will have 
  the new Default margin settings. If your changes are to be valid only in a single 
  document, it is best to create a new page style by repeating the previous procedure, 
  but selecting <B>New... </B>in the context menu listed in step 3 above. A completely 
  new style will be created and the new margins will be available only when you 
  apply that style to a page. </I> </P>
 
<P><I>In addition, be careful when you change the margins of your document area, 
  because it is possible to set them beyond the margins of your printer printing 
  area; if that should happen, a warning dialog will pop up to alert you.</I><BR>
</P>
 <P>The blinking cursor shows where your text will be 
  inserted if you type something. Try to type a sentence like: Hello World! (It's 
  a classic, isn't it?)</P>
 <P>It will be written with the default font and style. 
  Normally, when you type text in your document before another piece of text, 
  the already present section will be moved to the right by the the new insertion. 
  However, this behavior may not be useful in some situations. For example, when 
  you want to overwrite some words without using the deletion key on your keyboard, 
  you can switch to an <B>overwriting mode</B> by left clicking on the <B>INSRT</B> 
  box in the Status Bar. The wording shown in the Status bar will change to <B>OVER</B>. 
  (The Insert key will also toggle these modes.) Now, whatever you type will overwrite 
  any existing text in your document. To return to the insertion mode, simply 
  repeat the left clicking on the same place in the status bar. In every new document, 
  the cursor is located in the top left corner of your document area. If you want 
  to start to type in a different location and you have no text inserted yet, 
  you have 3 options:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P>You can insert many unneeded paragraphs by hitting the return key on your 
      keyboard until you have reached the point you desire. It's a bad and unprofessional 
      solution. You can use it only if you're very, very inexperienced. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>You can click the <B>Direct Cursor icon <IMG SRC="direct_cursor_icon.GIF" NAME="Graphic6" ALT="Direct Cursor Icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0> 
      </B>in the Main Toolbar<B> </B>and activate this function. This icon is 
      a toggle, that is, its function will be active until clicked again. Moving 
      the mouse pointer over the empty document area, you'll see a blue triangle 
      on the left. One more click and the cursor will jump exactly to the line 
      and position (left, middle, or right) where the triangle is. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>Finally, you can choose <B>Insert-Frame </B>from the Menu Bar to insert 
      a text box. You'll be able to locate and anchor wherever you want inside 
      your document. </P>
    
</UL>
 <P>Of course, documents composed of only 2 words aren't 
  very useful. So, type at least 2 or 3 lines of text, hitting the RETURN key 
  on your keyboard only at the end of your paragraph. You have created a paragraph. 
  Repeat the action again to create a 2 paragraph document. Now perhaps, you may 
  wish to select part of the typed text to perform some action on it. A selection 
  is a special kind of text highlighting that allows you to determine, to which 
  part of your text will be applied a particular action you will perform. Usually, 
  the selected text is displayed with white letters on a black background. You 
  can select in the following ways:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P>select a single word 
      by left clicking twice on it. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>select a line by 
      clicking 3 times somewhere inside it. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>select multiple lines 
      by left clicking once near the beginning of the text piece you want to select 
      and dragging the mouse, without releasing the button, upwards, until you 
      have reached the last word you want to select. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>select text pieces 
      that are not consecutive. Simply, select the first text section and then, 
      with the CTRL key held down, select another section. </P>
  <LI> 
     <P>select all text by sequentially hitting <B>CTRL+A 
      </B>keys on your keyboard. (Press and hold CTRL then press A.)</P>
</UL>
 
<P><I><B>Hint: </B>a powerful use of the selection function is to use it in conjunction 
  with the <B>Find</B> function that you can call with the keys <B>CTRL+F </B>or 
  by clicking on the <B>Find On/Off icon <IMG SRC="search_icon.GIF" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0></B> 
  in the Main Toolbar. In the <B>'Search for' </B>combo box of the dialog window 
  that will appear, you can insert a word to be searched for in your document. 
  Clicking on the <B>Search All</B> button of the dialog, every occurrence of 
  this word in your document will be found, so you'll be able to perform the formatting 
  or editing action you wish. Pay attention to where you click to switch the focus 
  from the <B>Find</B> dialog to the main document window. If you click inside 
  the document area, all selected words will be deselected, forcing you to repeat 
  the search. You can avoid this annoying effect by clicking somewhere on the 
  main window title bar (the first top bar that displays your document's tittle).</I></P>
 <P>You can perform four main actions on a selected 
  test: copying, cutting, deleting, and formatting. If you wish to copy to the 
  clipboard a piece of selected text just hit <B>CTRL+C.</B> Otherwise, if you 
  wish to cut it out and copy it to the clipboard hit <B>CTRL+X</B>. You can paste 
  your text back from the clipboard by hitting<B> CTRL+V.</B> These shortcuts 
  are standard and they have a Function Bar icon, too.</P>
 <P>Deleting action on a selected text is also common 
  to other Office Suites you may have used: simply hit the deletion key, space 
  bar, or type something to overwrite the selection. On the other hand, the formatting 
  action in OOo is slightly different from whatever you have known until now. 
  In fact, there are two way to format text in Writer:</P>
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P>use the tools provided from the Command Bar or Format Menu, </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>use the <B>Stylist </B>(see next section.) </P>
    
</OL>
 <P>For the time being, we'll analyse point 1 only.</P>
 
<P>You can start to modify a selected text by changing its style attributes. After 
  having selected what you want to change, click on one of the <B>attributes icons</B> 
  <IMG SRC="attributes_icons.GIF" NAME="Graphic8" ALT="Attributes icons" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=79 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0> 
  on the Command Bar. They transform the selected text (in sequence from left 
  to right) into Bold, Italics, and Underlined. It is also possible to use keyboard 
  shortcuts to get the same result:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>CTRL+B</B> for 
      bold, </P>
  <LI> 
    <P><B>CTRL+I</B> for 
      Italics, </P>
  <LI> 
     <P><B>CTRL+U</B> for Underlined. </P>
</UL>
 <P>A more accurate selection of text attributes can 
  be obtained by selecting <B>Format-Character... </B>or <B>Format-Paragraph... 
  </B>from the Menu Bar, according to the part of text you want to modify. In 
  OOo, you have options to modify both alignment and foreground, or the background 
  color of the text:</P>
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P>Click on one of the <B>alignment icons <IMG SRC="positions_icons.GIF" NAME="Graphic9" ALT="positions icons" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=99 HEIGHT=28 BORDER=0></B> 
      on the Command Bar to modify the text alignment (left, center, right, or 
      justified). </P>
  <LI> 
     
    <P>Click and hold for few seconds on one of the color icons <IMG SRC="colors_icons.GIF" NAME="Graphic10" ALT="color icons" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=29 BORDER=0> 
      on the Command Bar to display a color palette from which it is possible 
      to select the colors you wish. </P>
</OL>
 
<P><I><B>Hint: </B>the color palettes can be transformed into a floating window 
  that will remain open until you close it, by clicking on the close button in 
  its right upper corner. To perform this action, repeat step 2 of the procedure 
  listed above, click and hold the left mouse button on the color palette window 
  title bar, then drag the mouse somewhere over the document area, and finally 
  release the mouse button. This behavior is common to other pop-up windows of 
  the Main Toolbar.</I></P>
 <P>If you have executed all the procedures shown until 
  now, you should have learned how to type and change the main attributes of your 
  text. However, documents sometimes need a completely new &quot;look and feel&quot;. 
  You can get it by utilizing a new font or size in conjunction with attributes 
  to highlight a special section of the document such as: headings, quotations, 
  comments, and so on.</P>
 
<P>Usually, a new document default font is set to &quot;Thorndale&quot; or &quot;New 
  Times Roman&quot;. It may happen that you do not have these fonts in your system 
  or you don't like them. You can change the default fonts by choosing <B>Tools-Options 
  </B>on the Menu Bar and browsing in the <B>Options Dialog Window </B>that will 
  appear, down to <B>Text</B> <B>Document-Basic fonts (Western). </B>There, you 
  may change the font for default, headings, lists, captions, and indexes. Unfortunately, 
  this solution is a very radical one, that is, it will change your fonts in every 
  document you create. An alternative and better way to get the same result is 
  to use the <B>Change Font and Size </B>drop-down list <IMG SRC="fonts_dropdown_lists.GIF" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=26 BORDER=0> 
  that is located on the Command bar.</P>
 <P>The first, displays a preview of all fonts available 
  in your system. To see the whole list, click on the little button with the arrow 
  to the right of the combo box and scroll. The second, displays the height of 
  the font itself, expressed in points. Select a word or a piece of text and try 
  to change its font and size. As written above, it's the best way to create quick 
  headings or other special text format.</P>
 
<P><I><B>For Linux users only: </B>OOo can use TrueType fonts that are present 
  in your system, but it is able to manage other fonts that you wish to add independently, 
  from other applications. Run as root, the spadmin script you can find in the 
  OOo installation directory. With this tool you can add new fonts, and eventually, 
  printers.</I><BR>
</P>
 <H3><A NAME="stylist"></A>3. The Stylist</H3>
 <P>Imagine that you have written a long composition 
  with many sections with different headings style, and then at 4:55 PM, your 
  office boss comes in and says: &quot;I prefer Arial, instead of Verdana, as 
  heading font style and Georgia, instead of Times New Roman, for the normal text. 
  Please, change it before going home...&quot; Oh, yes, you have 5 minutes to 
  change tens of headings and paragraphs!</P>
 <P>It would be a terrible nightmare, if you had not 
  written this in your OOo Office Suite. In fact, in Writer, you can use the Stylist 
  tool to speed your changes up!</P>
 <P>The Stylist floating window shown below should be 
  displayed by default when you open a new document:</P>
 
<P><IMG SRC="stylist.GIF" NAME="Graphic12" ALT="Stylist window" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=307 BORDER=0></P>
 
<P>If it is not displayed, click on the <B>Stylist icon</B> <IMG SRC="stylist_icon.GIF" NAME="Graphic13" ALT="Stylist icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0> 
  that you can find on the function bar.</P>
 <P>We have already used it to create a new Page style 
  in Section 1. Now, we learn more about its utilization.</P>
 <P>The Stylist window is composed of a tool bar just 
  below the title bar where there are 5 icons on the left to switch between different 
  styles: <B>Paragraph, Character, Frame, Page, </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">and</SPAN><B> 
  Numbering Styles;</B> plus 3 more icons on the right which provide access to 
  some Stylist specific Functions: <B>Fill Format Mode, New Style From Selection, 
  </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">and</SPAN><B> Update style.</B> Below 
  this bar, there is a box where all available styles are listed. Finally, at 
  the bottom, a combo box lets you choose different filters to display, only partially, 
  the styles, according to the filter type you chose, for example: 'Chapter Styles' 
  rather than 'All styles' and there is also 'Automatic'.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT >After this brief overview, we can go 
  back to the example we talked about at the beginning of this section. How can 
  we change all those headings and paragraphs in 5 minutes? If you have used the 
  static styles as shown in section 2, it would be nearly impossible. That method 
  is useful only when you have to format 1 or 2 headings or words, nothing more. 
  Instead, with the Stylist styles (also called 'dynamic styles'), you have the 
  opportunity to change several text sections or even a whole book with few mouse 
  clicks. Let's see how it works:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P>Click on the first 
      icon, called 'Paragraph Styles', to display all styles related to paragraphs. 
      You will notice that there are some styles ready to use. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>To apply them to 
      a text you have written, you may choose between: </P>
    <OL>
      <LI> 
        <P>selecting the 
          text to which you wish to apply the style, then double click on a style 
          inside the Stylist, and that style will be immediately applied </P>
      <LI> 
         
        <P>clicking one time on a style in the Stylist and then clicking again 
          on the <B>Fill Format Mode icon <IMG SRC="fill_format_mode.GIF" NAME="Graphic14" ALT="Fill format mode icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=22 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0></B>. 
          This tool will remain selected until you deselect it. The cursor will 
          change into a blinking gray textured vertical line and the mouse pointer 
          into a paint bucket. When you click inside a paragraph or heading, all 
          text, in that paragraph or heading, will be modified. </P>
    </OL>
</UL>
 
<P>It's easy to understand that a composition using Styles is very easy to modify 
  with other ready-to-use styles included in the Stylist. Of course, OOo developers 
  cannot know every wish of every boss all around the world; this is the reason 
  why there exists a practical function to modify or customize existing styles.<BR>
</P>
 <P>To modify a style:</P>
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P>Be sure to have Paragraph 
      Styles selected, then choose the desired style by left clicking once on 
      it. It will be highlighted. </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>Then, right click 
      on the selected style for the context menu and choose <B>Modify...</B> </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>In the Dialog window 
      you can change the attributes you wish. </P>
  <LI> 
     <P>Click OK to confirm your choice or Cancel to 
      exit with no changes. </P>
</OL>
 <P><I><B>Hint:</B> if you have directly modified a 
  style in your document (applying a new font, color, size, etc.) you may update 
  the corresponding style included in the Stylist, so that all sections formatted 
  with that style will be automatically updated. To do so:</I></P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
     
    <P><I>select the modified text and then click on the <B>Update Style icon 
      <IMG SRC="update_style.GIF" NAME="Graphic15" ALT="update style icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=18 BORDER=0></B> 
      in the Stylist</I> </P>
</UL>
 <P><I>or, alternately,</I></P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P><I>drag the selected text and drop it onto a style in the Stylist. It will 
      be automatically updated.</I> </P>
</UL>
 <P>To create a new style:</P>
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P>repeat step 1 listed 
      above. Remember that your new style will inherit the features of the style 
      you have selected so be careful when you choose it,</P>
  <LI> 
    <P>right click on the 
      selected style to display the context menu, then choose <B>New...,</B></P>
  <LI> 
    <P>type a name for the 
      new style in the Organizer tab of the Paragraph Style Dialog Window that 
      will appear,</P>
  <LI> 
    <P>select the name of 
      the style that will follow in your document, the one just created. By default, 
      a paragraph style is followed by the same style, but in some circumstances, 
      you may prefer to adopt another way of working. For example, after a heading 
      paragraph, you may wish to have a simple text paragraph or a lower heading 
      style. If you select that style in this window, it will be automatically 
      selected as soon as you hit the return key on your keyboard. It's a good 
      way to save your time! </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>make the other changes 
      you need to fonts, tabulation, foreground, background color, etc.</P>
  <LI> 
     <P>confirm your choice by pressing the <B>OK </B>button 
      to close the dialog. </P>
</OL>
 <P><I><B>Hint: </B>a tremendously fast way to create 
  a new style is as follows:</I></P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P><I>to apply all modifications you wish in the new style to a piece of text 
      already written in your document,</I> </P>
  <LI> 
    <P><I>select it</I> <I>by highlighting,</I></P>
  <LI> 
    <P><I>click on the <B>New Style from Selection icon <IMG SRC="new_style_from_selection.GIF" NAME="Graphic16" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=23 BORDER=0> 
      </B>in the Stylist, and type a name for the new style in the <B>New Style 
      Dialog </B>that will appear. </I> </P>
    
</UL>
 <P>Concluding, your composition will be ready in 5 
  minutes if:</P>
<OL>

<H3><A NAME="printing"></A>4. Opening, saving, and printing a text document in 
  the OpenOffice.org Suite</H3>
<P>The opening, saving, and printing of files are the 
  most common actions in a word processor, and therefore, they have to be very 
  easy and accessible. The OOo Office suite gives you several alternatives.</P>
 
<P>When you want to open a document file, you can:</P>
 <UL>
  <LI> 
    <P>press <B>CTRL+O</B> 
      on your keyboard, </P>
  <LI> 
    <P>select <B>File-Open 
      </B>from the Menu Bar, </P>
  <LI> 
     
    <P>click the <B>Open File icon <IMG SRC="open_file.GIF" NAME="Graphic17" ALT="open file icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0> 
      </B>on the Function Bar.</P>
</UL>
 <P>Whatever you choose to do, an <B>Open File Dialog 
  Window </B>will displayed. There you can browse to the document file you wish 
  to open.</P>
 
<P><I><B>Hint: </B>The actions listed above are valid only when an OOo text document 
  window is already open. However, it would be a waste of time to open a blank 
  document only to open another file; so, the Windows OOo version has implemented 
  a <B>&quot;Quick Starter&quot;. </B>It is a program that starts when your system 
  starts and can be accessed through the little butterfly icon you should see 
  near the bottom right corner of your display. Double click on it and a <B>Templates 
  and Documents Dialog Window </B>will appear. In it, you'll be able to select 
  a document and to open it directly.</I> Right clicking the same icon will bring 
  up a simpler style of <B>Open File Window</B>.</P>
 <P>On the other hand, if you want to save a document, 
  you need to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
     <P>press <B>CTRL+S</B> on your keyboard, </P>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    <P>choose <B>File-Save</B> 
      from the Menu Bar, </P>
  <LI> 
     
    <P>click the <B>Save icon <IMG SRC="save.GIF" NAME="Graphic18" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=19 BORDER=0> 
      </B>on the Function Bar. </P>
</UL>
 <P>Once again, whatever you choose, the <B>Save File 
  Dialog Window</B> will be displayed.</P>
 
<P><I><B>Warning: </B>if your document has not been modified from the last time 
  it has been saved, the save icon will be grayed <IMG SRC="greyed_save.GIF" NAME="Graphic19" ALT="grayed save icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=19 BORDER=0> 
  and you will not able to save it again, unless you use the <B>Save as..</B>. 
  feature.</I><BR>
</P>
 <P>Now, we'll discuss how to print your documents.</P>
 <P>Since this How-To has been tested on a Windows OS, 
  the following content will describe the interaction between the Windows' printing 
  system and OOo. If you are a Linux or Solaris user, please refer to your printer 
  driver system to learn how to add a printer and how to use it with OOo; however, 
  many OOo internal dialog windows are equal on all platforms.</P>
 <P>Before printing, you have to set your default printer. 
  Choose <B>File-Printer Settings... </B>from the Menu Bar. In the <B>Printer 
  Setup Dialog Window </B>that will be displayed, your default printer should 
  appear in the combo box called 'Name'. If it is not installed, you have to set 
  it up from outside of OOo Suite, through your system printing tools. You will 
  be able to change some of the properties of your printer by clicking the <B>'Properties' 
  </B>button. This first phase has to be done once and then your printer will 
  be available, with the chosen settings, to all OOo applications.</P>
 
<P>After having checked your printer's settings you are ready to print; however, 
  it's a good habit to check how the document will look when printed, before printing. 
  Writer gives you a useful <B>'Page Preview' </B>feature. Select <B>File-Page 
  Preview</B> from the menu bar to switch to the<B> Page Preview Mode</B>. In 
  this mode you will see your document as it will be printed, but with a special 
  'page to page' view. You can also, simultaneously, see 4 pages by clicking on 
  the <B>Page Preview: Four pages icon <IMG SRC="preview_four_pages.GIF" NAME="Graphic20" ALT="page preview four pages" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0> 
  </B>that you see in the modified Object bar just above your document.You can 
  simply zoom in and out with the <B>Preview Zoom</B> icon <IMG SRC="zoom.GIF" NAME="Graphic21" ALT="preview zoom icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0>. 
  The preview page mode is not only important to see how your document looks, 
  but also to save paper, and therefore, more trees! In fact, there exists the 
  <B>Print Page view feature <IMG SRC="print_page_view.GIF" NAME="Graphic22" ALT="print page view" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>, 
  </B>that allows you to print exactly what you are seeing in the Preview Mode, 
  this is to say 2 or 4 pages a time! When you are done with the preview of your 
  document, you can directly print it by clicking on the <B>Print File Directly 
  icon <IMG SRC="../drawing_graphics/print_file_directly.GIF" NAME="Graphic23" ALT="print file directly" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=27 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>, 
  </B> close the Preview Page Mode by deselecting the <b>Page Preview icon</b> 
  <IMG SRC="page_preview.GIF" NAME="Graphic24" ALT="page preview icon" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=22 BORDER=0> 
  displayed in the Object Bar, or by double clicking on a Previewed page returning 
  to that page in the editor.</P>
 <P>If you wish, you still have the opportunity to modify 
  some printing features, before printing your document with the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
     <P>press <B>CTRL+P </B>on your keyboard, </P>
</UL>
 <P>or</P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
     <P>select <B>File-Print...</B> from the Menu Bar.</P>
</UL>
 
<P>The <B>Printer Dialog Window</B> will appear, in which you can choose how many 
  copies of your document you wish to print, which pages, where the printing output 
  is to be directed (printer or file), and other properties that you can access 
  with the <B>'Options...' </B>button you see to the left of the window. When 
  you click the <B>OK </B>button in this window, your document will be sent to 
  your printer or to the file you have chosen.</P>

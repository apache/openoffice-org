<P><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Description:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The Bibliographic module in OpenOffice is designed to provide
authors with all the required functionality to manage and use
bibliographies and references in writing research papers. In
addition, the Bibliographic module will allow users to share
bibliographies with co-authors using other popular bibliographic
software such as Endnote.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Offering input: </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>The best place to provide input is the mailing lists of the
OpenOffice Bibliographic module. You may join these lists by going to
<A HREF="http://bibliographic.openoffice.org/">http://bibliographic.openoffice.org</A>.
It is desirable that the bibliographic module focuses on
functionality that is really required by authors on a day-to-day
basis. In the opensource spirit, please feel free to express your
needs and every effort will be made to incorporate the functionality
if it really meets day-to-day needs. 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><H1>Purpose and scope of the Bibliographic module</H1>
</OL>
<P>The Bibliographic module will do the following:</P>
<P>Serve as the personal Bibliographic library and library for
&ldquo;serious&rdquo; writers</P>
<P>Serve as the repository of encyclopedic information for &ldquo;young&rdquo;
writers</P>
<P>Allow 1-click switching between bibliographic styles</P>
<P>Export bibliographic references in all popular formats such as
Bibtex, RIS (Endnote)</P>
<P>Import bibliographic references from all popular formats such as
Bibtex and RIS</P>
<P>Allow easy sharing of bibliographic styles</P>
<P>Allow easy creation of bibliographic styles</P>
<P>Provide intuitive and friendly GUIs for all these functions</P>
<P>Many functions of the biblio module resemble those that would be
desirable in a mini photo-album software. These features include
storing images, assigning captions to them, searching them through
captions etc. Some time should therefore be spent on identifying the
extent to which the design of the biblio module should be capable of
morphing into a photo-album module for OpenOffice.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Biblio_functional_requirements_6_27_html_396f2f2b.gif" NAME="Frame1" ALT="Frame1" ALIGN=LEFT><BR CLEAR=LEFT>These
functions are summarized in the illustration below.</P>
<OL START=2>
	<LI><H1>Users</H1>
</OL>
<P>We have identified three categories of users of the Bibliographic
module 
</P>
<P>Academic authors in the scientific disciplines: These are the
mainstream users who typically use the Endnotes-style references.</P>
<P>Other scholars: These are users who make extensive use of
footnote-style references</P>
<P>Young authors and common users: These are students in K-12 schools
who write term papers making extensive use of multimedia and
encyclopedia-style references in their class projects. These users
will be very interested in creating class presentations on Impress/
Draw. They are a very important category of users because they serve
a critical marketing function for OO.</P>
<P>Another group of users falls into this category. They are laymen
with no interest in publishing scientific articles, but looking for
an easy way to store and retrieve information. I am thinking of
storing pictures, songs, videos etc. Since we plan to make the
libraries available across networks, the Biblio module can serve as a
library for all digitizable information that people collect. Though
the biblio functionality will only appeal to a small subset of highly
technical users, every computer owner can find value in an
information store.</P>

<P>Priority: Reflects the priority of the use case on a scale from 1
(highest) to 5 (lowest)</P>
<P>Reference: Used interchangeably with citations and bibliographic
references. A reference is the description of an article in a media
outlet such as a magazine, journal, conference, report, personal
communications. All references in a document are usually listed
together in one place in the document and a label to the reference is
placed at the appropriate place in the document.</P>
<P>Bibliography: Used interchangeably with library</P>
<P>Visible references: The user may like to work with only a subset
of references in the selected library at any given time. Visible
references are the references that are currently available to work
with.

<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: This is the basic function of
the bibliographic module while working with documents. The user will
use a key combination such as ALT-1 or a menu entry (tools -&gt;
biblio -&gt; goto library) to switch to the biblio library. If the
biblio module is not open, the default library is opened. The user
selects references to be entered into the document and indicates that
these should be inserted (ALT-2 or menu item references -&gt; insert
into document). These citations should be inserted into the document
and the document should be formatted as per the specified style.</P>
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>: The user may select 1 or more citations
in the Biblio library at the same time, using the ctrl or shift keys.</P>

do is to create projects with a lot of images. Think of a project on
the life-cycle of a butterfly, or a travelogue of the trip during
summer break. Each of these concepts combines a list of images into a
common idea and should therefore be saved as one Now, it is possible

</P>
<P><STRONG>Pre-conditions for the input</STRONG>: 
</P>
<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: This is a universal search
capability for references in the current library. Users should be
able to specify an unlimited number of search conditions to search
within the library. Each criterion specifies the value of the keyword
to be searched for within the specified field. An example of a
criterion is &ldquo;last name contains smith&rdquo;. One of the
available fields should be &ldquo;any field&rdquo;. For users with
libraries that are not very large, I very much like the way Endnote's
default search criterion is &ldquo;any field contains&rdquo;.</P>
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>: Comparison operators should include
equals, does not equal, contains, is less than, is greater than.
Search criteria may be joined using AND, OR, NOT</P>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>: The references that match the search
criteria are shortlisted. If the biblio module has a filter function
to enable the user to work only with a subset of references at a
time, the search function may also have the semantics of a filter.
This is how Endnote works. The default view may be &ldquo;show all
references&rdquo; which changes to &ldquo;show selected references&rdquo;
when a search is applied.</P>

criteria.</P>

<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: Most journals expect the
bibliography to be the last section of the paper, after all
appendices and tables and figures. This is how biblio should function
by default. However, it may be useful to allow users to specify the
location in the document where they would like to place their
endnotes-style bibliography. The utility of this flexibility is that
users can place miscellaneous information (such as phone conversation
transcripts) in the document after the bibliography while creating
drafts. I do not know the exact utility of this functionality, but I
have often felt powerless with Endnote because I cannot specify to
Endnote where it should create the biblio.</P>

</P>
<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: This use-case is inspired by a
limitation I find in Endnote. I prefer to use Garamond as my
preferred font. However, I have not changed normal.dot and therefore,
the body-text font in normal.dot is Times New Roman (TNR). I find
that when Endnote formats the in-text citations, it formats them in
TNR and I have to go in and change the fonts in the in-text citations
to Garamond and it is very irritating. I therefore believe that users
will find it very appealing if biblio uses the character and
paragraph styles used in the current document to format the citations
rather than the specifications in normal.swt. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>: 
</P>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>: 
</P>
<P><STRONG>Possible errors</STRONG>: If users have not rigidly
followed style rules and have simply changed fonts inline without
applying styles, the proposed mechanism will still fail. Should
biblio then draw formatting information from the formatting of the
adjacent text? That may actually not be a bad idea. All it means is
that biblio should not apply any character and paragraph formatting
of its own and simply insert the citations in place and allow the
currently applied formatting to act on the citations.</P>

Whenever both features are on, the user should get a prompt to decide
whether or not changes to citations and the bibliography should be
tracked. The user should also be able to modify this selection easily

<P>My guess is that the best way to achieve this result is that if
the user selects for biblio changes to not be tracked, what Biblio
should do is disable tracking before it begins auto-format and then

<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: There should be a simple
interface for the user to add a new reference to the library &ndash;
something like reference (on main menu) -&gt; new (or ctrl-N) should
bring up a blank form for entering a new reference to the library.
This is the basic and familiar functionality of inserting new
citations into the biblio library. A form would be presented to the
user with blank values for all the fields available for the reference
type. Users should be able to move between fields using TAB or
CTRL-TAB keys. As the user enters data in each field, the entry
should be compared with the lists associated with each field and when
a match is identified, the user should be assisted with a suggested
auto-completion prompt. Pressing TAB should auto-complete the rest of
the name, title etc.</P>
<P>For fields that have associated term lists, if the new entry does
not exist in the list, it should be automatically added</P>

<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>: The software should first check to see if
this is a duplicate of an existing reference. It may sound absurd but
when the library grows big, it happens that you end up inserting a
duplicate reference. If it is not a duplicate, a new reference is
created and entered into the library. The reference is possibly
identified with a unique ID number generated by the biblio module.</P>

<P>It is also important to be able to handle corporate names such as
&ldquo;Sun Microsystems Inc.&rdquo; and author titles such as Jr..
One common mechanism for handling these cases is to specify that
these names be entered in a specific format. Endnote specifies that
corporate names should end with a comma (so that the whole name is
interpreted as the last name) and names with titles such as III, Jr.

Therefore, users are saving these files on hard disks. Many users
record whether they have print copies or pdf copies of these papers
using the special fields in Endnote. Since these papers are basically
intended for academic use anyway, it makes sense to store them within
the biblio library itself. This will make the biblio module a

</P>
<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: These days, a lot of information
is gathered from websites. Webpages can however have a very messy
structure. Browsers such as IE and Mozilla do a great job of saving
them as 2 objects &ndash; a &lt;filename&gt;.html file and all the
rest of the content in a &lt;filename&gt; folder. Ideally, I would
like the following: I drag the .html file to the biblio window. This
pulls up a <I>new reference </I>window of type html page and inserts
this html page into the <I>top-level page</I> field. What would be
really cool is that as soon as the top-level page field is populated,
biblio scans the directory for a folder with the name of the file.
When the folder is found, it is automatically dropped into the <I>folder</I>
field. I anticipate that the most common use for this html page would
be to first drop it onto the desktop and then view it. This would
imply that when the html file is dragged <I>out</I>, the folder an
dits contents are dragged out to the same folder as well.</P>
<P>However, I can easily anticipate that users would like to simply
click the file inside their library and view the contents without
dragging and dropping to the computer's file-system.</P>
<P>This is clearly a wish-list item. However, I also think it is very
useful.</P>

<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: To make OpenOffice and the
biblio module popular, it will be necessary to provide users with
styles for all outlets they deal with such as journals and
conferences. An initial set of the most popular styles could be made
available through the efforts of volunteers but in the long-term, it
should be envisaged that the outlets themselves would be responsible
for creating the styles for their publications and make them
available for download into biblio from their websites. This will
ensure that users will have the current styles for all their needs
with very little effort. To facilitate this, it should be possible to
work with styles as simple files, perhaps text (XML) files. This is
one of the great features of Endnote. Styles are as portable in
Endnote as the references themselves. 
</P>
<P>It may even be possible to save the style inline in a document
along with the used citations. I often find that when I try to work
with a document on multiple computers, I don't have the styles on all
computers. If the day comes when styles will be universally
available, then it may not be necessary to export the styles into the
documents, but until then, this is a very useful function. It has
also been mentioned in the requirement for exporting the library
inline.</P>

eventually have a complete list of styles, presumably one for every
journal published and users will download an ever increasing number
from the respective publishers, most users only use a subset of
available styles on a day-to-day basis. For example, a historian will
probably never use an engineering style and an engineer will have no
use for most of the social science styles. Therefore, instead of
requiring users to select the correct style for a document from the
entire list of styles, the styles commonly used should be made
readily available for selection. So, if an author frequently submits
articles to ACM and IEEE conferences and journals, they will only
shortlist the styles used by these outlets.</P>

America may become america and CIO may become cio if the user chooses

authors if they would like to create a document with the list of
references matching some criterion. It may be that this is to share
the references with a colleague or to submit as an appendix to a
grant proposal. I personally believe that the most common use will be
to email the detailed citation to a colleague without retyping or
copying and pasting. If no citation is selected, the semantics of the
command should be &ldquo;print all references in the library that are
currently shown&rdquo;. However, if this list exceeds say 10
references, biblio should prompt with &ldquo;this command will print
more than 10 references, are you sure you want to continue?&rdquo;.

is necessary</P>
<P>Note that this function is complementary to the ability to export

could just open my library, select the required citations,

The user is prompted to specify the name of the library and whether
they would like to make the new library the default library. Most
users only have one library and this function hand-holds users into
creating and using that library in their work. It is a &ldquo;the
application is the computer&rdquo; kind of function. When users
invoke the biblio for the first time, this function walks them
through setting up the library with a reasonable name (from system
settings perhaps) and file location (my documents or user's home) by
default. For future sessions, this library is opened by default
whenever biblio is opened unless the user specifies some other
action.</P>

<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: Biblio must be natively
integrated into writer and impress during installation of either
program. Though it may be useful to see biblio as just another data
source, it will be very helpful, particularly for new users to see
biblio as just another module of writer/ impress. This integration
could be in the form of a biblio toolbar, or a biblio entry in the
tools menu or a key combination (Endnote uses ALT-1 ).</P>

</P>
<P><STRONG>Action on input</STRONG>: With all the functions being
proposed for the biblio module (mainly the storage of pdf files,
images etc. inside the biblio library), the library can become a
researcher/ writer's most precious resource very quickly. It has to
be treated with great care, taking every precaution to save it from
damage of any kind. 
</P>
<P>For well-connected users in Universities, newsrooms and other
enterprise environments, this usually means saving the library on a
networked drive that is backed up as per policies. It must be
remembered that it would not be surprising if the library grows to
~GB in size with the embedded files.</P>
<P>For stand-alone computers, users should be given the option of
specifying backup policies. This could be prompts for disk backups,
ISP backups etc. For stand-alone computers, biblio may even suggest
that users not store documents inline because that may make backups
difficult. An the other hand, users may find it useful to store all
their important documents in biblio to make it a single-point storage
location.</P>
<P>There should also be a <I>save copy</I> (in addition to <I>save
</I>as) command in the file menu for one-off backups.</P>

biblio and in fact, any OO component is portability to every platform
to which OO has been ported, preferably with minimal effort. This
implies that the programming environment should be portable across

introduced, such as a library engine to store references, should also
have a vision of portability with a vibrant community committed to
making it happen.</P>

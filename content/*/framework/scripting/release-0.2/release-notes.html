<H1>Release Notes</H1>
<H2>Installation</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The installer now takes some optional command line arguments:</P>
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.51cm"> java -jar SFrameworkInstall.jar [-office &lt;path_to_office_installation&gt;]
 [-netbeans &lt;path_to_netbeans_installation&gt;]
 [-help]</PRE>
	<LI><P>If you are installing the framework on the windows platform (
	for language other than english ) you may experience difficulties,
	the installer looks for the sversion.ini file in either the user's
	home directory or  in the &ldquo;Application  Data&rdquo;
	sub-directory of the user's home directory. To install the framework
	copy the sversion.ini file to the user's home directory or to the
	&ldquo;Application Data&rdquo; sub-directory in the user's home.
	(Note: you may need to create the sub-directory called &ldquo;Application
	Data&rdquo;) 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2>Script Binding</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is important the only the
	&quot;Assign Script To ...&quot; dialogs are used to create &amp;
	delete script bindings for Scripting framework Java &amp; Beanshell
	scripts. While these bindings also appear in the Tools-&gt;Configure
	dialog, that dialog should <B>not </B>be used to delete these
	bindings as the results are undefined and may lead to a loss of all
	menu items! In a future release, both these dialogs will be
	integrated, resolving this issue.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&ldquo;Assign Script to ..&rdquo;
	dialogs work only for the following applications, writer, calc,
	impress, draw and presentation.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Languages displayed in the
	&ldquo;Language&rdquo; combo-box for all &ldquo;Assign Script to
	...&rdquo; menus is populated with &ldquo;Java&rdquo; by default and
	then with the corrosponding languages for any associated installed
	runtimes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Given that Control-Shift-Digit key
	combinations are not available to OpenOffice.org on all platforms,
	these bindings are not supported by the Scripting framework. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The scripting framework contains a
	number of helper scripts for its own use. Logical names starting
	with an underscore followed by a dollar sign and a script name, eg.
	&quot;_$HelperScript&quot; are reserved for this purpose, and will
	not be displayed in the assign dialogs. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In order to
	save a script event binding to a menu item or key into a document
	there are two steps which must be followed. Firstly, set up the
	binding in the usual way using the &quot;Assign Script To ...&quot;
	dialog. Then open the Tools-&gt;Configure dialog, and select the
	&quot;Menu&quot; tab. Click the &quot;Save&quot; button, select the
	document into which you wish to save the binding, and click &quot;Save&quot;.&nbsp;
	You will be prompted with a dialog that says &quot;The file already
	exists. Overwrite?&quot;. It is OK to click &quot;Yes&quot; as this
	will simply write the bindings into the file. Saving a binding to an
	event into a document can be done by clicking the &quot;Document&quot;
	radio button in the &quot;Assign Script to Event&quot; dialog.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In both the Writer &amp; Calc
	applications, the Format menu is dynamically generated. For this
	reason the Scripting Framework does not allow the user to bind
	scripts to entries in the Format menu in any of the applications. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is not possible to assign
	scripts to menus, keys or events in Web or Formula documents (only
	Writer, Calc, Impress &amp; Draw). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Currently the Scripting Framework
	does not prevent the user from duplicating menu entries, for example
	it is possible to create a second &quot;New&quot; menu entry under
	the &quot;File&quot; menu. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Comboboxes in the &quot;Assign
	Script To ...&quot; dialogs are not read-only. Editing their
	contents will prevent the generation of script bindings and will
	result in a StarBasic error message being displayed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>It is not possible to create top-level menus from the &quot;Assign
	Script to Menu&quot; dialog. However, the following steps will
	create a new top-level menu which can then be used in the &quot;Assign
	Script To Menu&quot; dialog. Open the Tools-&gt;Configure dialog,
	collapse the top-level menu entry preceding&nbsp; the location where
	the new top-level menu entry is to be placed and click the &quot;New
	Menu&quot; button. The new menu &quot;Menu&quot; will be placed
	below the highlighted menu item. Left clicking this entry, pausing,
	and left-clicking again (ie. not a double-click), will allow the
	user to rename the menu. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The user/Scripts directory should not 
    be moved or deleted as it contains scripts (in the java/ScriptfrmwrkHelper 
    directory) that are used by the Scripting Framework (in the creation of 
    script bindings). While the NetBeans deploy will re-create a missing 
    user/Scripts directory it does not restore the helper scripts.
    </P>
</UL>
<H2>Script Security</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Security warning dialogs are
	displayed upon first invocation, and not on document load as is done
	for StarBasic. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When the security setting is &quot;Always&quot;, and &quot;Show
	Warning Before Running&quot; the Scripting Framework displays the
	correct dialog. StarBasic displays a dialog more appropriate to
	&quot;According To Path List&quot;, and while this issue has been
	fixed (<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=11822">Issue
	11822</A>) the fix is not present in OpenOffice.org 1.1 beta.</P>
</UL>
<H2>IDE &amp; Deployment</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>On some versions of Solaris problems have been observed in
	NetBeans when renaming Java source files for Parcel Recipes (<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=11986">Issue
	11986</A>). The source files can be successfully renamed by first
	opening and closing them once, and then attempting the rename. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When deleting a deployed parcel located in an Office document
	from the NetBeans IDE ,the document should be closed first.</P>
	<LI><P>The Interactive BeanShell Scripting window does not currently
        report any errors that occur while evaluating a script, so your
        BeanShell script may fail silently. See the <a href="user-guide.html">
        User Guide</a> for an example of how to add debug statements to your
        BeanShell script.

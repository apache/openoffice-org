   <h2>CVS Checkout</h2>

   <p>You can use CVS to check out your own copies of project source code files if you are a member of this project with CVS login access. CVS is an open source version control for keeping track of all modifications to project source code files. You can choose either a <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html">command-line CVS client</a> or <a href="http://www.wincvs.org/download.html">WinCvs</a> with a Windows interface. What you can do with source files depends upon your role in this project. (<a href="/nonav/docs//project/www/docs/ProjectRoles.html">Roles?</a>)</p>

   <h3><a id="commandlinecvs" name="commandlinecvs">Command-line CVS checkout instructions</a></h3>

   <p>(<a href="#wincvs">Skip to WinCvs checkout instructions</a>)</p>

   <p>Before you can do a cvs checkout, you must set the cvsroot to indicate where the CVS repository for this project is located.</p>

   <ol>
    <li>
     The command to set cvsroot and login is: 

     <p><code>cvs -d :pserver:username@projectname.domain.net:/cvs login</code></p>

     <p>(Substitute in your login for username, and the project name and associated domain, of course.)</p>

     <p>If this is the only project you working on, you only need to set the cvsroot once. Thereafter when you log in to this domain, the cvs repository for this project is assumed. If you are working multiple projects, however, you must specify the cvsroot each time you log in to ensure that the cvs repository you are accessing is the right one.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
     To check out the project source repository an individual module (if you don't need the entire repository), type: 

     <p><code>cvs -d :pserver:username@projectname.domain.net:/cvs checkout [projectname]</code></p>

     <p>This command should result in a scrolling list of files being added to the local directory you specified on your machine. Now you are ready to use your file editor to work with individual files and make changes.</p>
    </li>
   </ol>

   <p>When you are ready to contribute your work into the project's CVS repository, you must <i>commit</i> each file you have modified into the project repository. But before you do that, you should set up an SSH tunnel for security purposes.</p>

   </ul>

   <h3><a id="wincvs" name="wincvs">WinCvs checkout instructions</a></h3>

   <p>To use WinCvs to check out your own set of source code files, you must first set up the correct cvs root using the following steps.</p>

   <ol>
    <li>
     Launch WinCvs and select <b>Cvs Admin - Preferences</b>. Enter the CVSroot: 

     <p><code>:pserver:username@[projectname].[domain].net:/cvs</code></p>

     <p>Click OK.</p>
    </li>

    <li>If this your first cvs checkout, create a folder in Windows Explorer to hold all of your cvs project folders. Then create a subfolder for this project. (You may even want to create separate subfolders for each module if you're working in more than one.)</li>

    <li>In WinCvs, select <b>Cvs Admin - Login</b> and enter your cvs password.</li>

    <li>Click on the left window in the program and select a folder. Then select <b>Cvs Admin - Checkout Module</b>. Select the project folder you created earlier.</li>

    <li>Enter project module name and click OK. You should see a scrolling list of filenames as these are created in your folder(s).</li>

    <li>Repeat the module creation process for each additional cvs module you wish to check out.</li>
   </ol>

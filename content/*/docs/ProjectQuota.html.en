   <p>Project quotas allow administrators to define the amount of disk space allocated to each project in the domain. Administrators can choose to use either a predetermined allocation or define their own quota values. If a project exceeds the quota the administrator will be notified and can select one of three possible actions:</p>

   <ol>
    <li>The administrator may select to lock the project. This action will render the project invisible to anyone with less than project owner access rights. If a project is locked, the administrator must be contacted to remove the restrictions.</li>

    <li>The project owner may work with the administrator towards an acceptable solution. The agreed upon solution may include archiving old news or issues.</li>

    <li>No action may be taken. In this case, the quota may be used as a form of monitoring disk usage and planning for future needs.</li>
   </ol>

   <h3><a id="using" name="using">Using quotas</a></h3>

   <p>As the administrator, you have the ability to change the disk-space quota for projects in your domain. You will need to set two levels of quota for each project: the soft disk-space quota and the hard disk-space quota. For the quotas to function correctly, the soft disk-space quota must be greater than 0 but less than the hard disk-space quota. The hard disk-space quota must be greater than the soft disk space quota as well.</p>

   <p>The soft disk-space quota is designed as an early warning level for the project owner. Daily, a scan checks the amount of disk-space used by each project in the domain. If the amount of disk-space used for an individual project exceeds the soft disk-space quota, an email is sent to the project owner warning him or her that their project is reaching the maximum disk space available. The project owner will receive this email each time the project is determined to exceed the soft disk-space quota. To lower the space used, the project owner may choose to clear some of the project's items from the disk.</p>

   <p>If a project has exceed the allocated hard disk-space quota, an email alert is sent to the administrator and a lock project request notice is placed in the administrator's home page. The administrator receives the notice only once each time the project exceeds the hard disk-space quota. The action to be taken is completely at the discretion of the administrator and the normal procedures for the implementation.</p>

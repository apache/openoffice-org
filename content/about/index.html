<h2>About Apache OpenOffice</h2>

	<p>Apache OpenOffice is both a <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/product/product.html">product</a> and an <a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/">
open-source project</a>. Both have been in existence since <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/sun-open-source-for-the-masses/">October 13th, 2000</a>. (see also <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/ec13Oct.html">Birthday Story</a>).</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org 1.0 (the original name, pre-Apache) was released on April 30th, 2002.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org's mission statement was drafted by the community:</p>

<blockquote style="font-weight: bolder; font-style: oblique; font-size: 110%;">To create, as a community, the leading international office suite that will
run on all major platforms and provide access to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and an XML-based file format.</blockquote>

<p>Since its inception as an open source project. our corporate contributors have 
included Oracle, RedFlag CH2000, and
IBM. Additionally over 500,000 people--unaffiliated individuals,
business and government employees, and students from nearly every curve of the
globe--have joined the project with the aim of creating the best possible office
suite that all can use. Their work as a community is both invaluable and practical:
people use what the community does. This is the essence of an open source
community. </p>

<p>The remainder of this page summarizes the project and suggests how you can
contribute to it.</p>

<h3><a name="history"></a>Historical background</h3>

<div class="indent">

<p>StarDivision, the original author of the StarOffice
    suite of software, was founded in Germany
in the mid-1980s. It was acquired by Sun Microsystems during the summer of 1999
    and StarOffice 5.2 was released in June of 2000. Subsequent versions of
StarOffice software, beginning with 6.0, were built using the OpenOffice.org source, APIs, file formats,
and reference implementation. Sun continued to sponsor development on OpenOffice.org
for the next 10 years, a period during which not only did the project grow tremendously
and became truly global, but the user base also saw an extraordinary increase,
and as of the end of 2010 was estimated to be in excess of 100 Million. With its acquisition of Sun in 2010, Oracle was the principal
contributor of code to OpenOffice.org. On June 1, 2011, OpenOffice.org, the project and product, including source code, trademarks, domain names and website,
were donated to the Apache Software Foundation.</p>

<p>The source is written in C++ and delivers language-neutral and scriptable
  functionality, including Java&trade; APIs. This source technology introduces the
next-stage architecture, allowing use of the suite elements as separate applications
  or as embedded components in other applications. Numerous other features are
  also present including XML-based file formats based on the vendor-neutral <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">
OpenDocument Format (ODF)</a> standard from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/org/">OASIS</a> and
other resources.</p>

Not for Profit (NFP) organizations of all sizes are turning to Apache OpenOffice - software that meets their needs and shares their values. The **flexible word processor**, **powerful spreadsheet**, **dynamic graphics**, **database access** and more meet all the requirements for an office software package.

OpenOffice offers a high degree of compatibility with commercial office software, but with none of the costs or license worries.

  - **Software for all**

    More than ever, NFPs need to be able to compete for attention in a crowded marketplace. With Apache OpenOffice, NFPs have access to essential office software which is every bit as good as the expensive commercial tools used by those for whom money is no object. Developed over twenty years, OpenOffice is a mature, stable, product, guaranteeing trouble-free usage. OpenOffice is a leading international force in the movement for digital inclusion - making software of the highest quality available to all, regardless of income. Join in OpenOffice's international community to exchange ideas, look for inspiration, or just ask for help.

  - **Better but compatible**

    Apache OpenOffice prides itself on its compatibility with other office software. NFPs who rely on voluntary workers appreciate the fact that people who have any office software experience are immediately at home with OpenOffice. OpenOffice also understands that no organization is an island, which is why it can exchange files with other office software. It also allows you to create PDF files for those all-important times when you want to retain control of documents after they leave your office. It is also the first software in the world to store your precious information in an ISO approved format - the best guarantee for the future.

  - **Open world**

    Amazingly, Apache OpenOffice comes without any license fees, or any worrying small print. You can install it on as many computers as you like, use it for any purpose, and even give copies away for employees, supporters, etc. to use at home. Already available in a wide variety of languages, OpenOffice actively encourages local teams to provide more translations. For NFPs - charities, voluntary sector organizations, etc - OpenOffice is simply the easiest and cheapest way of providing the essential software tools needed for an effective operation.

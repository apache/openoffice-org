<h1>If you want user support and don't want to file a bug...</h1>
Please navigate to the <a href="/support">Support Page</a> where you'll find a variety of ways to get help with Apache OpenOffice
including a "users" mailing list and the OpenOffice.org Community Forum.

<h1>If you want to contact the Apache OpenOffice developers...</h1>
Please check out the <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html">mailing list page</a> and use the developer mailing list.

<h1>If you want to search existing issues, you can use this simple interface...</h1>
It searches only for bugs that are marked "Open" in the "www" project. This means that it may miss bugs which have been fixed in internal builds. Using this will open the search in a new browser window, <b>Bugzilla Window</b>. If your problem shows up in the issue listing, please add your own comment to the original report. You will have to Log In properly to Bugzilla from the <em>Bugzilla Window</em> to do that. <p>Additionally, if your issue is not found in the issue list, and you want to submit a new issue, you can apply for a Bugzilla account from the <em>BugZilla Window</em>.</p>

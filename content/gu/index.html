<H2>Welcome to OpenOffice.org: gu.openoffice.org </H2>
<p><b>OpenOffice.org </b> is an open source project with as its mission statement: 
"To create, as a community, the leading international office suite that will run on all major platforms 
and provide access to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and an XML-based file 
format.
</p>
<p><b>OpenOffice.org </b> is also the <i>product</i> that is being developed within this context. It is an 
office suite that is free for everyone, and has modules for textprocessing, spreadsheet, vector graphics,
HTML editing en presentation. 
WIth respect to range of functionality en way of operation, it is comparable to the well-known (not free) 
office suites, and definitely should be considered as an alternative for those. 
As it is available at no cost, it is easy to evaluate it in your particular operation. In any case, the
recent versions have already shown themselves to be very suitable to many (e.g. home) applications. 
</p>

<p><b>gu.openoffice.org</b> is a sub project of OpenOffice.org that intends to make the project as well as the product
more accessible to the Gujarati speaking community.</p>
<p>Within the lang/NL project there is given special attention to aspects of OpenOffice.org that are important to 
Gujarati speakers.
<p>gu.openoffice.org is meant to add to, not to replace, the existing OpenOffice.org project. THat is why you will find many 
links to the English pages of the project.</p> 
<p><b>Navigation:</b> in the box on the right you will find links to pages of the gu project.<br>
The gu pages are embedded in the general, much bigger OpenOffice.org web site. On top and on the left of the 
page you will find links to the (English languages) pages of it</p>

<p class="Header"><a name="mission"></a>Mission Statement</p>
<p>The Sets category of the Distribution sub-project exists to provide a space
  for community members to gather customized files & installations. All members
  of OpenOffice.org are encouraged to create customized installations. Although
  there will be standard customizations, there will be no limit as to how many
  we can create. The project will aim to provide scripts to create the customized
  downloads.</p>
<p class="Header"><a name="explanation"></a>Explanation</p>
<p>Customized downloads will also be known as sets. The 3 standard sets will
  be: Minimum, Express, Maximum. They will be abbreviated as: Min, E, Max. In
  the file list @ the bottom of the screen, you should be able to see file names
  that start with: OOoMin, OOoE, OOoMax. All 3 sets have the advantage of being
  compressed with bz2, which means shorter downloads, than the regular install
  binaries.</p>
<p>In the following table, you should be able to find a description of what is & is
  not in each of the 3 sets, as well as the benefits. We try to make it as easy
  as possible for you to decide which is best for you.</p>

    <td>This has as few files as possible. It contains only that which is needed
      to allow the user to run Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, & Basic. The
      galleries will be empty. There are no templates, no images, no sound files,
      no help files & no filters. This is ideal for people who wish to create
      a new customization, starting with only the base system. This has been
      compressed with bz2, which means a shorter download.</td>

      sound files, & help files. There are no filters. This is ideal for most
      people who aren't sure what they need, & will be only working on OOo documents.

    <td>OOo Maximum</td>
    <td>This has all the features & benefits that a standard OOo download could
      contain. It is better than a standard download, because it is easier to
      install. You just have to unpack it, & run the regular binary called "soffice".
      This has been compressed with bz2, which means a shorter download.</td>

To aid you in your decision making, we offer the following information as a reference
for how big the regular downloads are for installing. In other words, these are
the approxiamate file sizes that you would normally
need to download.<br>
Windows: approx. 60 MB<br>
Linux: approx. 74 MB<br>
Solaris (S): approx. 81 MB
<p class="Header"><a name="participate"></a>How to Participate</p>
<p>First, subscribe to our developers list by going <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">here</a>,
  and clicking "Subscribe" under the first list mentioned.</p>
<p>Next, please scan the archive of our discuss list to catch up on what's been
  discussed so far, by going <a href="/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=dev">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then, you might consider introducing yourself, letting us know how you found
  out about the project, what your interest is, and anything else you care to
  share.</p>
<p>The tools used to create the sets are the environment package & the script
  package. For the most part, the environment package is complete, & there probably
  won't be anymore development with it. It consists of directories, documentation,
  a few misc. scripts & configuration files for customizing OOo installs. The
  script is supposed to be downloaded & unpacked in the main environment directory.
  The environment & the script were deliberately kept in seperate packages. This
  done so that when the script is upgraded, the directories wouldn't have to
  be emptied out of the customized files just for the sake of packaging the tools.
  The environment package also includes a couple of autoconf files that are necessary
  for executing the script. To know which script is required for which environment,
  you just have to look @ the first number of the version. @ the time of writing,
  the environment package is 1.0, & the script is 1.5. Therefore the script will
  work with the environment, because they both start with 1.*. Even though the
  second number is 0 & 5, they should still compatible. There will be better
  documentation sometime later.</p>

Apache OpenOffice Distribution FAQ</H1>
<H2><A NAME="old_distribution_list_information"></A>
Do you distribute OpenOffice on CD/DVD? Where is the old distribution list/information?</H2>
<P>The Apache OpenOffice project distributes Apache OpenOffice online, as a
free download from our website. Although this is sufficient for most
users, we also know that for other users, a copy of OpenOffice on
CD-ROM or other media is preferred.</P>
<P>We used to have a &quot;Distribution
Project&quot; that listed the contact information for 3rd parties who
would provide, at a charge, a CD-ROM containing OpenOffice. We've
suspended this program. If you want to voice your opinion on
the distribution project, or offer any opinions, please send them to
our public mailing list, at dev@openoffice.apache.org.</P>
<H2><A NAME="OpenOfficeLicense"></A>
What do I need to know about the OpenOffice License?</H2>
<P>Apache OpenOffice, since version 3.4, is distributed by the
Apache Software Foundation and uses the Apache license, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">Apache
License v2</A>. More about this license and how this license applies
to various scenarios can be found on the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html">Apache
License and Distribution FAQ</A> page. 
</P>
<P>Versions 3.0-beta to 3.3, named OpenOffice.org 3.3, etc., used
the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser
General Public License v3</A>, LGPL.</P>
<P>You should comply with the terms of these licenses for any
distribution you undertake.</P>
<H2><A NAME="download_and_logo_use"></A>
Can I let my clients download your software and use your logo on my
website or other distribution media?</H2>
<P>Please see the <A HREF="http://openoffice.apache.org/trademarks.html">Apache
OpenOffice Trademarks</A> page for more information about the
&quot;Apache OpenOffice&quot; and &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot;
trademarks and what you need to do to use them. Also, please review
information which applies to <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/marketing/art/index.html">older
OpenOffice.org logos and icons</A> on <A HREF="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Art/Logo/License">the
OpenOffice wiki</A>. 
</P>
<H2><A NAME="cd_and_dvd_distribution"></A>
Can I Produce a CD/DVD of your software and distribute it?</H2>
<P>Yes, this is covered under Apache License 2 for Apache OpenOffice
3.4 or later, and covered under the LGPL for older versions. Please see <B>I'm
not a lawyer. What does it all MEAN?</B> section of the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html">Apache
License FAQ page</A>. This means you can distribute unmodified
versions of Apache OpenOffice as Apache OpenOffice, without modifying the product name.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="ebay"></A>
Can I sell, on CD or DVD, an unmodified version of Apache OpenOffice on Ebay or similar site?</H2>
<P>Yes, this is covered under Apache License 2. Please see the previous question.
We require that people selling Apache OpenOffice on EBay or similar sites include this note
for trademarks acknowledgment:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Apache OpenOffice can be downloaded free from the official site
<a href="http://openoffice.org">http://openoffice.org</a>. Apache, the Apache feather logo,
and OpenOffice are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation. OpenOffice.org and the seagull
logo are registered trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that use of other trademarks, such as the OpenOffice logo, requires explicit permission.
See <A HREF="http://openoffice.apache.org/trademarks.html">http://openoffice.apache.org/trademarks.html</A>.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="partnership_links"></A>
I want to link to your product/page. Will you partner with me and
link to mine?</H2>
<P>Due to the number of potential distributors of Apache OpenOffice,
this is not feasible. We are hopeful that well-known search engines
will be able to find your &quot;packaging&quot; or &quot;distribution&quot;
with minimal effort.</P>
<H2><A NAME="renaming_product"></A>
Can I distribute OpenOffice on a CD, or from my website and call it
something else?</H2>
<P>Generally, no. If such a need arises for whatever reason, please
contact the <A HREF="mailto:private@openoffice.apache.org">Apache
OpenOffice PMC</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="personalization"></A>
Can I distribute OpenOffice and use my company's name with it?</H2>
<P>If you, as company ABC, wish to distribute OpenOffice on a CD with
a label &quot;ABC OpenOffice&quot;, the answer is &quot;no&quot;.
This would be a trademark use violation. This is covered in the
Apache License version 2 document under section <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">6.
Trademarks</A> .</P>
<P>You could use wording such as &quot;ABC's Office Suite Powered by
Apache OpenOffice&quot; as an alternative. Please contact the <A HREF="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">Apache
OpenOffice development list</A> with additional questions about this
type of use.</P>
<H2><A NAME="more_questions"></A>
I still have questions, what should I do?</H2>
<P>Please contact the <A HREF="mailto:private@openoffice.apache.org">Apache
OpenOffice PMC</A>.</P>

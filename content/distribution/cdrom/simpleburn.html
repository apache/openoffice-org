<h1 align="center">Distribution of CD copies of OpenOffice.org</h1>
<p>OpenOffice.org allows you to make copies for distribution to
friends, colleagues, or others. All you need is a CD burner.</p>
<p>To make a copy (please see below for more information):</p>
<hr noshade />
<h1 align="center">Quick Start instructions.</h1>
<p>Many of the instructions are links. Click for more detailed instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="#mailinglists">Join the CD-ROM Distributors mailing list so that you will know ifwe make a new
'official' version so that you will not be distributing old
versions.</a></li>
<li>
<p>Download the "ISO" image of the CD from
&lt;mirror&gt;/openoffice.org/contrib/iso/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;language&gt;</p></li>
<li><a href="#burning">
Burn the ISO image to a CD.</a></li>
<li>
<a href="#test">Install it to test that it worked.</a></li>
<li>
<p>Print copies of the CD labels -- add an insert for the Jewel
case or DVD case <a href="ooo_cd-labels.zip">This zip file contains some documents
that make a simple, standard label for the CD and jewel box in
English.</a></p></li>
<li>
<p>Make copies for people who need them.</p></li></ol>
<hr noshade />
<h1 align="center"><a name="mailinglists"></a>Detailed Instructions.</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Join the
<a href="mailto:cdrom@distribution.openoffice.org">CD-ROM
Distributors mailing list</a> so that you will know if we make a
new 'official' version.</p>
<p>Simply send a completely empty email to <a 
href="mailto:cdrom-subscribe@distribution.openoffice.org">this subscription address (Click here to
send it).</a></p></li></ul><p>Every once in awhile we will have a new features or bug fixes ina new release. When fully
tested it is called a "Stable Release"meaning it is ready for users, as opposed to various test
releases.</p>
<p>You will not get much email from this list, just a warning or
two when a new stable release is expected, and a notice when it is
available to be picked up so that the old release should not,
generally, be used any more.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download the "ISO" image of the CD. <!--Insert mirror selection form here--> (<a class="c1"
href="#whatis">What is an ISO?)</a></p></li>
<li><a name="burning"></a>
<p>Burn the ISO image to a CD.</p>
<p>As we said, "Almost all CD burning software will let you burn an
ISO image to a CD." This step should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Different CD burning software has different commands. Please see
a local tech person if you have difficulty burning an ISO to a
CD.</p></li>
<li><a name="test"></a>
<p>Install it to test that it worked.</p>
<p>You should install your newly burned CD to make sure that the CD
works correctly.</p></li>
<p>OpenOffice.Org correctly upgrades in place so you do not have to
be concerned about <i>uninstalling</i> previous releases.</p>
<li>
<p>Print copies of the CD labels -- <a href="ooo_cd-labels.zip">This zip file contains some documents
to make a simple, standard label for the CD and jewel box in
English.</a></p></li>
</ul>
<hr noshade />
<h3>Some things to remember.</h3>
<p>If you distribute OpenOffice.org please be sure that people can
look at the box and know what to do with the CD. You may wish to
print fuller instructions.</p>
<p>At the very least:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify OpenOffice.org and the stable release number.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Tell people to read file README.TXT or
README.HTML.</p></li></ul>
<p>We provide a simple, <a href="ooo_cd-labels.zip">sample CD label and jewel box insert.</a></p></li>
<li>
<p>Make copies for people who need them.</p></li></ul>
<p>Your CD burner probably makes CD copies easily. All 'best
practices' are needed for making a good CD copy among which are
certainly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not burn at too high a burn rate.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Do not do many other things on the computer that is
burning</p></li>
<li><i>Verify</i> the burn result if your software allows you
to.</li></ul>
<hr noshade />
<h3><a name="whatis" id="whatis">What is an ISO?</a></h3>
<p>An 'ISO' image is all the files for a CD in one big file. You
may think of it as being like a ZIP archive with lots of files in
one file.</p>
<p>Almost all CD burning software will let you bur an ISO image to
a CD. After you do this, all the files and directories are
available on the CD just as with other means of making a CD.</p>
<p>Note: we recommend using CD-R media, the ones that cannot he
re-written to. Not only are these cheaper but also they prevent any
problems with people changing files later on.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with <i>signatures</i> there are MD5
signatures for checking your ISO download, usually in the same
location as the ISO. We recommend checking the download if you have
or can get a signature checking program.</p>

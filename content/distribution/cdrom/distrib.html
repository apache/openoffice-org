<p class="Header"><a name="mission" id="mission"></a>Mission
Statement</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org welcomes efforts to distribute the software and
grow the community. These points below are meant to clarify issues
relating to how you may represent yourself, whether you can use our
logo, and more generally, what OpenOffice.org is about.</p>
<p>The purpose of Distribution Project is to establish policy and
consolidate areas and links relating to the distribution of
OpenOffice.org. Distribution includes the Mirrors Project, CD-ROM
Project, and the experimental P2P project, which is still under
development. For now, the Download pages, in English and in other
languages, are not linked to this project.Please go to
the<a href="http://download.openoffice.org/index.html">Download
Central page</a>.</p>
<p>Distribution's (sub) projects are fairly autonomous and
independent but use the same mailing lists and follow the same
distribution policies.</p>
<p class="Header">Derived Works</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org code is also the infrastructure for many other
applications. Within the open-source constraints of our
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/license.html">licenses</a>, you
are free to build applications using the source.</p>
<p>If you build any application using OpenOffice.org, please
include the phrase: "Derived from OpenOffice.org." We areproud of
our work and wish others to see what it is capable of. Please also
let us know by sending a note to the
<a href="mailto:community@openoffice.org">Community
Manager</a>.</p>
<p class="Header"><a name="policy" id="policy"></a>Policy on
Distributions: What To Distribute</p>
<p>We have created a page dedicated to explaining the files you can
offer. If you are interested in distributing OpenOffice.org files,
go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://distribution.openoffice.org/files.html">Files:
What to Distribute</a></p></li></ul>
<p class="Header"><a name="community" id="community"></a>Community
Distribution</p>
<p>A Community Distributor may be a person or group who has gained
permission to distribute OpenOffice.org and use the official
logos.</p>
<p>This group includes those who are managing download servers
mirroring OpenOffice.org's software (binaries, source, ancillary
files), CD-ROM distributors, OEM builders, and even peer-to-peer
networks.</p>
<p>Our system now includes several "official" volunteer mirrors,
from which the software can be downloaded (see "Files" section) but
no "official" CD-ROM or OEM distributors. All our CD-ROM and OEM
distributors are "Community Distributors."</p>
<p>To become a Community Distributor, whether of OEMs, CD-ROMs, or
mirrored files, contact the
<a href="mailto:community@openoffice.org">Community
Manager.</a></p>
<p>You may request permission to use the logo and other graphics
(as for CD-ROMs). Only those who have been granted permission to
use the logo and other graphics may use them. You may only use our
graphics, not your own.</p>
<p>Other requirements for community distribution:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must subscribe to the relevant
<a href="#mailinglists">mailing lists</a></li>
<li>
<p>You must read our licensing provisions. See the
<a href="http://distribution.openoffice.org/project/www/about_us/OEM_and_CD.html">
OEM-CD page</a> for information. It links to useful
pages.</p></li></ol>
<p>Please also join the appropriate sub-project (listed below):
CD-ROM, Mirrors, P2P. We encourage you to join so that we may
coordinate work more efficiently. For instance, we can more
specifically notify project members of updates and changes in
policy or files.</p>
<p>As to benefits: OpenOffice.org is receives over two million page
hits every week. You are also joining in distributing a product and
enlarging a project that is changing the world.</p>
<p class="Header"><a name="mailinglists"
id="mailinglists"></a>Mailing Lists</p>
<p>We have three primary mailing lists. You must be subscribed to
the dev@distribution list to post unmoderated messages. All are
welcome to join, but it is obligatory that all Community
Distributors only join the "announce@distribution.openoffice.org"
list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="mailto:dev@distribution.openoffice.org">dev@distribution.openoffice.org</a>:
For discussion on issues relating to distributing the software,
mirroring, and establishing peer-to-peer networks.</li>
<li>
<a href="mailto:announce@distribution.openoffice.org">announce@distribution.openoffice.org</a>:
For announcements relating to new releases, updates, and other
important information. Not a discussion list.</li>

Apache OpenOffice Distribution FAQ</H1>
<h2 name="distributor_main">I want to become an Apache OpenOffice distributor. What do I need to know?</h2>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/distribution/best-practices.html">Distributor Best Practices</a> for overall requirements.</p>
<H2><A NAME="distributor_list"></A>
What type of support does Apache OpenOffice provide for distributors?</H2>
<p> We have a <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/distribution/distributors.html">Distributor listing</a> on this web site.
Please see the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/distribution/distributor_instructions.html">How to Get Listed in the Distributor page</a> for instructions.</p>
<H2><A NAME="OpenOfficeLicense"></A>
What do I need to know about the OpenOffice License?</H2>
<P>Version 3.4, named Apache OpenOffice 3.4 and distributed by the
Apache Software Foundation, uses Apache license, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt">Apache
License v2</A>. More about this license and how this license applies
to various scenarios can be found on the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html">Apache
License and Distribution FAQ</A> page. 
</P>
<P>Versions 3.0, beta to 3.3, named OpenOffice.org 3.3, etc., used
the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser
General Public License v3</A>, LGPL.</P>
<P>You should comply with the terms of these licenses for any
distribution you undertake.</P>
<H2><A NAME="download_and_logo_use"></A>
Can I let my clients download your software and use your logo on my
website or other distribution media?</H2>
<P>Please see the <A HREF="http://openoffice.apache.org/trademarks.html">Apache
OpenOffice Trademarks</A> page for more information about the
&quot;Apache OpenOffice&quot; and &quot;OpenOffice.org&quot;
trademarks and what you need to do to use them. Also, please review
information which applies to <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/marketing/art/index.html">older

</P>
<!--
<H2><A NAME="cd_and_dvd_distribution"></A>
Can I Produce a CD/DVD of your software and distribute it.</H2>
<P>Yes, this is covered under Apache License 2 for Apache OpenOffice
3.4, and covered under the LGPL for older versions. Please see <B>I'm
not a lawyer. What does it all MEAN?</B> section of the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/foundation/license-faq.html">Apache
License FAQ page</A>. This means you can distribute unmodified
versions of Apache OpenOffice as Apache OpenOffice, or older versions
of OpenOffice.org as OpenOffice.org. 
</P>
-->
<H2><A NAME="partnership_links"></A>
I want to link to your product/page. Will you partner with me and
link to mine?</H2>
<P>Due to the number of potential distributors of Apache OpenOffice,
this is not feasible. We are hopeful that well-known search engines
will be able to find your &quot;packaging&quot; or &quot;distribution&quot;
with minimal effort.</P>
<H2><A NAME="renaming_product"></A>
Can I distribute OpenOffice on a CD, or from my website and call it
something else?</H2>
<P>Generally, no. If such a need arises for whatever reason, please
contact the <A HREF="mailto:private@openoffice.apache.org">Apache
OpenOffice PMC</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="personalization"></A>
Can I distribute OpenOffice and use my company's name with it?</H2>
<P>If you, as company ABC, wish to distribute OpenOffice on a CD with
a label &quot;ABC OpenOffice&quot;, the answer is &quot;no&quot;.
This would be a trademark use violation. This is covered in the
Apache License version 2 document under section <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">6.
Trademarks</A> .</P>
<P>You could use wording such as &quot;ABC's Office Suite Powered by
Apache OpenOffice&quot; as an alternative. Please contact the <A HREF="mailto:dev@openoffice.apache.org">Apache
OpenOffice development list</A> with additional questions about this
type of use.</P>
<H2><A NAME="more_questions"></A>
I still have questions, what should I do?</H2>
<P>Please contact the <A HREF="mailto:private@openoffice.apache.org">Apache
OpenOffice PMC</A>.</P>

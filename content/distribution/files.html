<h1>Distribution Project: Files To Distribute</h1>

<h2 id="files">What To Distribute</h2>

<p>Our policy on distributing OpenOffice.org software derives from discussions that took place in the Mirrors Project. The issues were:
<ul>
  <li>What files to distribute</li>
  <li>How to collate the files so that they may be efficiently distributed</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In the case of OpenOffice.org, this was a particularly annoying problem as new files, new localizations, new platforms are constantly being added.</p>
<br/>

<h3>New mirror structure</h3>

<p>To be prepared with new releases in the future we have created a new structure. If you want to have more information about this then please read on in the
Wiki for the <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/New_OOo_Mirror_Structure" title="Definition of the new mirror structure">
<br/><strong>Definition of the new mirror structure</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 id="sets">Datasets</h2>

<p>Today we distribute the following datasets:
<ul>
  <li><strong>main</strong>: Contains the subdirs /stable, /contrib, /localized + packages/)</li>
  <li><strong>extended</strong>: Contains the subdir /extended and the main dataset</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>

<h3>What the directories refer to</h3>

<table class="datasets" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Directory</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>contrib/</strong></td><td>Un-QA'd binaries, dictionaries, and other related files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>extended/</strong></td><td>Un-QA'd localized binaries and sources, Beta Releases, Release Candidates, Developer Snapshots and other related
      files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>localized/</strong></td><td>Binaries for localized files: /de, /fr, /ja, ... These have been tested by the community.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>packages/</strong></td><td>The same like for localized/ + stable/ but sorted into packages that are devided for language regions. Please see
      the ".../packages/packages.txt" file for more details.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>stable/</strong></td><td>At least the most recent build, e.g., /3.3.0. Each directory includes the binaries and source.</td>
    </tr>

<h2 id="sizes">Structures and sizes of the datasets</h2>

<h3>Main</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>root dir</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>contrib/</strong>: ~150 MB</li>
    <li><strong>stable/</strong>: ~5 GB</li>
    <li><strong>localized/</strong>: ~100 GB <sup>1)</sup></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>packages/</strong>: ~100 GB <sup>1)</sup> or a few KB <sup>2)</sup></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><sup>1)</sup> You can choose if you want to distribute the localized/ or packages/ subdirs or both. It's also possible to distribute some of the subdirs
in packages/ if you are not interested in all languages.</p>

<p><sup>2)</sup> If you distribute localized/ and packages/ together, then the packages/ subdirs should normally contain only hard links and therefor only a
few KB. If you take hard links into account when sync'ing then you don't distribute real files but their hard links only. This saves disk space and
bandwith.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Extended</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>root dir</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>contrib/</strong>: ~150 MB</li>
    <li><strong>extended/</strong>: ~100 GB</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>stable/</strong>: ~5 GB <sup>1)</sup></li>
      <li><strong>localized/</strong>: a few GB <sup>1)</sup></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>packages/</strong>: a few KB <sup>2)</sup></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><sup>1)</sup> It's only a fe GB and not ~100 GB as for the main dataset because it's mostly hard links from the extended/ subdir that represent the latest
release. The remaining GB comes from files that are older than the latest release.</p>

<p><sup>2)</sup> If you distribute localized/ and packages/ together, then the Packages/ subdirs should normally contain only hard links and therefor only a
few KB. They refer from the latest Release Candidate in extended/ to the files in localized/ + stable/. And from localized/ + stable/ into packages/. If
you take hard links into account when sync'ing then you don't distribute real files but their hard links only. This saves disk space and bandwith.

<h2 id="archive">Archive Servers</h2>

<p>We also have archive servers for mirroring legacy and rarely-used content. <a href="mirrors/archive.html">See more details here</a>.</p>

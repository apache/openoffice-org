<H1>Location of the new UI project(s)</H1>
<P>A lot of the common UI classes uses specialized SfxPoolItems which
are located in SVX. This means that the new UI project(s) need to be
located above SVX. On the long term, this dependency should be
removed, but at the moment having it would ease the migration.</P>
<P>OTOH, the projects should be below OFFMGR, which would be a main
client of the functionallity.</P>
<H1>Configuration</H1>
<P>It seems desirable to have a separation of configuration data, to
distinguish between framework UI data and application UI data. At the
moment, this is no primary goal for feasibility reasons.</P>
<H1>Customizeable UI</H1>
<P>On the long term, SO should have customizeable UI in a sense (at
least) that vendors can replace dialogs, menus, toolboxes etc. with
their own implementations. For this, the question rose where the line
between exchangeable and not-exchangeable components should be draw.
For instance, it seems difficult to allow to exchange single
tab-pages in common dialoges. This would make the interface of such
components very complex (and probably expensive).</P>
<P>Instead, it seems reasonable to claim that (only) dialogs as a
whole are exchangeable. For this, such a dialog component would
simply work on an object which can be passed (e.g. the shape which's
properties are to be changed), this way keeping the interface rather
simple. Our &#147;default implementations&#148; then would have the
full power of all the common helpers (SfxItemSet etc.), without the
need to model this in UNO.</P>
<H1>Taking an inventory</H1>
<P>As not everybody has a clear perception about the amount of
classes/helpers which are now in the responsibilities of the UI team
(especially FS complained), OS is to assemble of list of them,
including dependencies to the different projects which at the moment
contain common UI (TODO).</P>
<P>After this, the splitting/regrouping of all this code can be
discussed, including questions about which components should be
loaded on demand etc.</P>
<H1>Preferred application class</H1>
<P>In the course of the upcoming changes, we should have a clear
responsibility for the application UI. At the moment, the
SfxApplication (sfx2) as well as the OfficeApplication (offmgr) both
take a part of them. To have a clear distinction between framework
and office UI, it seems desired to move the latter to the
OfficeApplication. FS will discuss this idea with MBA and see if
there are any objections from the framework side.</P>
<P>Remark: All initials for names should be
interpreted as &lt;Initial&gt;@openoffice.org</P>

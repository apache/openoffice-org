<h2>Help IDs in OpenOffice.org</h2>
<p>In OpenOffice.org, ever user interface element (a dialog control, a
menu item, whatever), needs to have a unique help id. To some extent,
you as the developer are responsible for ensuring this ...</p>

<h3><a name="why"></a>Why your controls need help ids</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Every visible "item" in the UI must have a unique help id, so
help content can be created for it</li>
  <li> Automated testing using the <a
 href="http://qa.openoffice.org/qatesttool/index.html"> QA test tool</a>
needs help ids to address certain UI elements within the test scripts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="dialogs"></a>Dialogs, Tab pages, and the like</h3>
<h4><a name="resources"></a>Resources</h4>
<p>If you declare your dialogs (which from now on will be a placeholder
for Dialog, ModalDialog, TabPage, and other such "control containers")
using resources, some things are done automatically. For instance,
let's consider the following resource:</p>
<pre>    ModalDialog RID_DLG_IDENTIFIER<br>    {<br>        // ... some stuff<br>        Text = "the dialog";<br><br>        FixedText FT_LABEL<br>        {<br>            // Pos/Size/etc. ...<br>            Text = "the label";<br>        };<br>        Control CTL_CONTROL<br>        {<br>            // Pos/Size/etc. ...<br>        };<br>        OKButton PB_OK<br>        {<br>            // Pos/Size/etc. ...<br>        };<br>        CancelButton PB_CANCEL<br>        {<br>            // Pos/Size/etc. ...<br>        };<br>    };<br>    </pre>
<p>Here, you don't have to care about the fixed text, and the buttons
(and even the dialog itself). Simply forget about them: HelpIDs will be
generated automatically for them, both for usage with the help system,
and for usage with the QA test tool.</p>
<p>However, you need to care for the Control. For this "generic" type
(as opposed to the concrete types you usually encounter), you need to
manually ensure that it gets a help id, and that this help id is usable
for others. See "<a href="#manually"> Manually declaring help ids</a>"
below for how you do this.</p>
<h4><a name="programmatic"></a>Programmatic element creation</h4>
<p>If you create your UI elements programmatically (e.g. within the C++
source code at runtime), then you also need to <a href="#manually">declare
help ids manually</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="menus"></a>Menus and toolbars</h3>
<p><em>(Yet to come)</em></p>
<h3><a name="manually"></a>Manually declaring help ids</h3>
If you have an UI element which needs a manually declared help id, the
following is necessary:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Find a number</em>: Usually, the project you live in has a
file <code>*help*.hrc</code> (or so) where help ids for this project
are declared. Find a free place therein, and add a new define such as </p>
    <pre>    #define HID_MY_PERSONAL_HELP_ID         ( base + offset )<br>          </pre>
Here, <code>base</code> is usually a project-wide base id, and offset
an incrementing number within this project. For instance, if you're
within the project <code>svx</code>, base would be <code>HID_SVX_START</code>.
    <p></p>
    <p>However, care must be taken: Every project does not only have a
start for its help ids, but also an <b>end</b>. It's really a
project-relative <b>range</b> of ids you are allowed to use. If you
leave this range, bad (and hard to notice) things will happen at
runtime. In <code>svx</code>, for example, the range you have to
respect ends with <code>HID_SVX_END</code>.</p>
    <p>Now how can you determine this range, and what do you do when
the range is used up? Look at <a
 href="http://ooo.ximian.com/lxr/source/util/svtools/inc/solar.hrc">
svtools/solar.hrc</a>: This is where all help id ranges (and for that
matter, other id ranges such as for resource ids) are defined. If you
want to know where your particular range ends, or if you need a new
range: Use this file.</p>
    <p>To stay with our example: You will find that <code>svtools.hrc</code>
defines two ranges for <code>svx</code>, one from <code>HID_SVX_START</code>
to <code>HID_SVX_END</code> and one from <code>HID_SVX_EXT0_START</code>
to <code>HID_SVX_EXT0_END</code> ... </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Assign this number</em>: Set the new help id at your UI
element. In a resource file, you may do this with </p>
    <pre>    HelpId = HID_MY_PERSONAL_HELP_ID;<br>        </pre>
In C++, you'd do this with
    <pre>    m_aMyControl.SetHelpId( HID_MY_PERSONAL_HELP_ID );<br>        </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Export the number</em>: With the previous steps, the help id
is already available to the online help. However, your QA engineer will
tell you that s/he cannot test the new dialog/tabpage/whatever, because
the <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/qatesttool/index.html">QA test
tool</a> does not have access to your control(s). This is because you
need to <em>export</em> the help ids which you declared manually (in
opposite to the ones which where declared implicitly during the build).</p>
    <p>Every project should have a <code>hidother.src</code> file,
usually located in the <code>util</code> directory. Grab it, and add
your new id there as follows: </p>
    <pre>    hidspecial HID_MY_PERSONAL_HELP_ID { HelpId = HID_MY_PERSONAL_HELP_ID; };<br>        </pre>
    <p>If your project does not yet have a <code>hidother.src</code>
file just create one. To get it built you also have to insert the
following line in your <code>makefile.mk</code> just somewhere below
the TRAGET= line: </p>
    <pre>    GEN_HID_OTHER=TRUE<br>        </pre>
Now, build the project, and deliver it. When you (now or later) build
the <code>instsetoo</code> project, a file called <code>hid.lst</code>
will be generated, and placed in <code>&lt;platform&gt;/bin.&lt;minor&gt;</code>
(e.g. <code>unxlngi5.pro/bin.m38/hid.lst</code>). This should make
your QA engineer happy .... </li>
</ul>

				<P>Currently, the code for common user interface (I'll abbreviate
				this with CUI from time to time) elements are wide-spread over at
				least 4 different projects: SVTOOLS, SFX2, SVX, OFFMGR.<BR>This
				includes:</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P>common base classes like the SfxTabDialog/SfxTabPage</P>
					<LI><P>frequently used components such as Character
					Formatting</P>
					<LI><P>self-contained components like the internal file-open
					dialog</P>
					<LI><P>common toolbox controllers like the one for the
					Undo/Redo-dropdown</P>
					<LI><P>specialized SfxPoolItems</P>
				</UL>
				<P>Note 1: <I>This does <strong>not</strong> include fundamental
				controls like buttons, fixed texts, and such - they're part of the
				VCL layer, and we're not interested in them here. Also, this does
				not include low-level UI helpers as the SvTreeListBox and
				BrowseBox - at least not in the first run.</I></P>
				<P>The reasons for this are various, one bold-printed line in the
				list of these reasons titled &quot;History&quot; ....<BR>Several
				drawbacks of the current situation become obvious (most of them
				having a &quot;performance issue&quot label on their back).</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P>Maintaining this primeval forest becomes more and more
					difficult as it grows.</P>
					<LI><P>The startup behaviour of the office suffers: Just because
					later on, there may be a need for, say the character formatting
					tab page, the library containing this page is loaded at the
					moment the writer is started</P>
					<LI><P>An application does not have a chance to deny loading of
					unused code: Opening the Tools/Options dialog means loading a
					lot of code for some pages present there - though they're not
					needed</P>
				</UL>
				<P>Note 2: <I>To prevent this question from arising: We're
				not talking about actually creating tab pages which are not
				needed. There already are good mechanisms which ensure that there
				is no page for the Load/Save options created if you do not open
				the Options dialog on exactly this page. But the <I>code</I> for
				this page is loaded into memory - as well as the code for, say,
				position and size of a shape of the drawing layer, and on some
				platforms also the code for the UNO representation of some
				drawing layer components, just because they're all in one lib --
				Did I already mention that it's weird?</I></P>
				<P>Note 3: <I>Of course, there are a lot of options pages
				which are application specific and not implemented in the CUI,
				but in the application itself. But splitting the applications
				into a core and a UI part is a completely different story.</I></P>

				<P>If a application wants to bind a given ToolboxController to a
				slot id, it calls some kind of (static) RegisterXYZ method. There
				are different shades of this (sometimes the slot id is passed,
				sometimes it's hard coded, some controllers need a module pointer
				passed, etc.), but the main idea is always the same.</P>
				<P>So, for outsourcing the controllers to CUI, we need to broaden
				the interfaces so they cover all possibilities, which mainly
				means that there needs to be a static RegisterXYZ function for
				every controller.</P>

				office to their very personal preferences will never load b) in

				<P>A main requirement is to load code, only on demand. This means
				we need factories to create all the components we want to
				provide.<p>Note 4: <i>It surely is oversized to use UNO
				mechanisms for this (though UNO already features an abstract
				factory concept), as this would mean that our components
				would need to be wrapped in UNO.</i><p>Looking at what kind of
				interfaces, applications typically use, we have the following:</P>
				<UL>
					<LI><P><B>factories</B>: For tab pages, a Create method is
					passed when referring to a page class, which means we need a
					factory which creates such factory functions.</P>
					<LI><P><B>direct instantiation</B>: For dialogs, the
					applications need immediate access to an instance of a class,
					thus we need to provide simply factories</P>
					<LI><P><B>static init functions</B>: For toolboxes, as mentioned
					above, an application needs to know (and call) a static
					RegisterXYZ function only.</P>
				</UL>
				<P>In ideal, applications would link only against a library
				containing all the factory methods, and create all needed
				components indirectly using these factories. We then can even
				hide the more detailed library structure: Whether a given tab
				page (created by a factory) is located in library X or library Y
				is of no interest to the application. This placement in libs can
				even be changed without any notice - the application still only
				calls the factory, and the factory decides which other lib to
				load to create the component.</P>
				<P>Of course, we still need to expose the interfaces of the
				classes created by the factories, which in C++ means the class
				declaration has to be exported, and the methods have to be kept
				virtual (as calling non-virtual method requires linking against
				the implementation lib.)</P>

<H2>What do we want to achieve with the user interface project?</H2>
<P>We want to focus all UI related issues in one project.
Development, discussions, proposals - everything should be at the
same place. It is currently typical that the developers of the UI are
spread in different projects. Most of them are not only dealing with
UI, but also with other responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>This UI project will be the home for all the UI related stuff.</P>
<P>On the technical side, the current situation has the drawback,
that large libraries are getting loaded at startup time.  The code of
course doesn't get loaded, but the loading time of libraries has a
relation to the amount of functions that are exposed by this library.
While moving the UI code itself to the UI project over the time, one
important goal will be a solution for this problem, probably by
moving the code to some smaller libraries and loading them on demand.</P>
<P>I think that we should not simply move the code from one place to
another. There is some code that is old and maybe more code that is
very old; and other code that is very very old :-). The developers
listening here will understand that some of the code has already
reached a kind of  &quot;end of life&quot; in the sense of
maintainability. If one wants to know what I mean, he might want to
dig in code like from the Stylist, the Ruler or the Tools/Configure
dialog.</P>
<P>Another important feature, which we might want to implement is at
a first step a replaceable UI. This could mean that one is able to
replace i.e. dialogs, accelerators, pop up menus and such.
Replaceable means that one can easier integrate one of the
applications into his own environment/application as a component. In
the longer term a second step might be a customizable UI.
Customizable means that one would be able to customize the UI to his
own needs for himself, his deployment of OpenOffice.org or his
integration of OpenOffice.org, by i.e. reduce the functionality of
certain dialogs without the need of providing an own one.</P>
<P>Your contribution is welcome.

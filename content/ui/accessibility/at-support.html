<h2>Support of Assistive Technology</h2>

<p>OpenOffice.org lets users create, modify, view, and print documents
easily and intuitively by providing a graphical user interface (GUI).
Accessibility is about enabling users who can not use such a graphical user
interface do the same things.  This is done by using Assistive Technology to
provide alternative user interfaces (UIs) that are suitable to such
users.</p>

<p>We could of course change the whole UI and replace it with an
  altogether different one.  But that has two major drawbacks:
<ul>
<li>Two people with different abilities could not help each other
  because their user interfaces had nothing or very little in
  common.</li>
<li>We would have to provide a special UI for every AT device.  The
  vendor of such a device knows much better than we do, how the UI for
  their device should look or sound like.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A much better solution is to use a generic representation of both
document and existing GUI that grants AT devices full access to them.  The
AT device vendors can then use this abstraction to provide an
<em>additional</em> user interface.  This way both the graphical and the
alternative user interface are available at the same time and thus people
that use them can work together on the same document.</p>

<p>For this generic representation we will support both the Java
Accessibility API (JAA) as well as the Gnome Accessibility API with a
two-layer architecture: The OpenOffice.org applications themselves implement
our own UNO Accessibility API (UAA).  The UAA is independent from but
influenced by the Accessibility APIs of Java and Gnome.  In the second layer
the UNO Accessibility API is then bridged to the Java and Gnome
Accessibility APIs.</p>



<h3>UNO Accessibility API</h3> 
<p>The UNO Accessibility API (UAA) is described in more detail 
<a
href="unoapi.html" 
title="Description of the UNO Accessibility API">here</a>.  
It defines a set of interfaces and services that are implemented by all UNO
objects that belong to the GUI.  Corresponding to the tree hierarchy of
graphical user interfaces the UAA represents the GUI as a tree of accessible
objects which can be queried by AT about properties like names, roles,
geometry, and color.</p>



<h3>Bridging the UNO Accessibility API to Java and Gnome</h3>
<p>Bridging the UNO Accessibility API to the Java Accessibility API (JAA) on
Windows allows OpenOffice.org to utilize the work that Assistive Technology
(AT) Tool vendors have already done to make Java applications accessible on
that platform. While the Microsoft Accessibility API only covers a small
subset of user interface objects like menus and such, the JAA of JDK 1.4
features additional interface to describe also documents sufficiently.</p>

<p>A similar bridge to the Gnome Accessibility API takes advantage of
  already existing AT tools that use that API and that run under Solaris and Linux.</p>


<h3>Document representation</h3>
<p>All elements of an OpenOffice.org application that are visible on the
  screen have to be represented by to UAA to be made accessible to the AT
  and thus to the user.  For Java GUIs like menus,
  buttons, and text fields accessibility implementations already exist.  The
  OpenOffice.org widgets try to be consistent in their accessibility
  behavior with their Java counterparts.</p>

<p>For the central part of every application window, the document window in
  which a document is visualized, a corresponding Java implementation does not
  exist.  We thus had to define our own guidelines how to make document views
  accessible.</p>

<p>The <a href="docrep-guidelines.html" 
title="Guidelines for document representation">guidelines of document
representation</a> describe the general design principles of how to make
  document views accessible and are independent from the application with
  which the document is edited.</p>

<p>However, the document representation differs for the different
  OpenOffice.org applications.  You can find links to the descriptions of
  the document representation for the individual applications below: <ul>
  <li><b>Writer</b><br>
	<a href="proposal-writer.html"
	title="Proposal of the representation of writer documents">Proposal</a> of 
	how to make Writer and Writer/Web accessible.</li>
<li><b>Calc</b><br>
	<a href="proposal-calc.html"
	title="Proposal of the representation of calc documents">Proposal</a> of
    how to make Calc accessible.</li>

<h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
<p>There is a graphical test tool, the <a href="AWB.html" 
title="Description of the AWB test tool">Accessibility Work Bench</a>, that
  uses the UNO Accessibility API to retrieve the accessibility tree from
  running OpenOffice.org applications.  It allows developers of the UAA to
  see what information is available from the outside.</p>


<h3>Details of API support</h3>
<p>This sections describes the more technical details of supporting the
accessibility APIs.</p>

<p>The general strategy will be to extend the OpenOffice.org API by an
accessibility section.  This accessibility API, which will be closely
modeled after the Java and Gnome Accessibility API, can then be mapped
easily on either of that two.</p>

<p>Using our own OpenOffice.org Accessibility API as an intermediate layer
  between the office and the accessibility APIs used by AT
  devices has the advantage that we can easily support more then one
  API and can react flexible to future changes in those APIs.</p>

<p>We will exploit the fact that we already have an API, that gives
access to all the details of OpenOffice.org documents.  This allows us to
gather all code, that implements the OpenOffice.org Accessibility API, in
one place, rather than to insert it at a very many places into
existing source.

<h2>Spreadsheet document Accessibility</h2>

<p>Proposal</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>



<p>This paper describes how documents of the StarOffice/OpenOffice.org

Calc application can be made accessible by using the UNO

Accessibility API (UAA).</p>





<h3>2. General</h3>



<p>Spreadsheet documents consist of one ore more tables. Each table contains

a lot of cells and can contain many other objects. There are many ways to

access this things.</p>

<p>The cells can you access by the position or with an index.</p>

<p>To access the other objects you have some possible ways. On the one hand

you can get this objects with the navigator. On the other hand you can get

this objects as childs of the cell or table were the anchor is.</p>

<p>To make the Data Pilot and Database Ranges more accessible we should extend

the navigator.</p>



<h3>3. specific problems</h3>



<h4>3.1. notes</h4>

<p>The notes are handled as the description of a cell. It does not matter

whether the note is showed or not, the description is given always.</p>



<h4>3.2. merged and matrix cells</h4>

<p>With the methods getAccessibleColumnExtentAt and getAccessibleRowExtentAt I

will make the dimension of merged cells accessible. The dimension of matrix

cells is only to find out while going from cell to cell and have a look at

the formula. This is the same way a not disabled person it does.</p>



<h4>3.3. column and row description</h4>

<p>At the moment it is not possible to give the column or the row a description.

If the user asks for the description he will get in the first step the name of

the column/row and he can not change the description.</p>



<h4>3.4. Outlining</h4>

<p>At the moment I have no idea how to make outlining accessible. Perhaps it is

enough to use the current menu structure.</p>



<h4>3.5. Index range</h4>

<p>The index range is no problem at the moment, but if we change the row and

column count (and we will change this) we could need a bigger range for the

index.</p>



<h4>3.6. Shapes</h4>

<p>Shapes are children of the root object which also contains the currently

viewed table. We have to handle this in this way, because otherwise it would

not be possible to select all shapes. To represent the anchor of a shape there

is a realtion between the shape and the cell or table with the anchor.</p>



<h4>3.7. Formulas</h4>

<p>Formulas are only accessible by the edit line or in the edit mode of the
cell. There is the same behaviour for not disabled people.</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>This paper describes how documents of the StarOffice/OpenOffice.org Chart
application can be made accessible by using the UNO Accessibility API (UAA).</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
<h3>2. Chart Documents</h3>

<p>In contrast to other applications, a chart document has a relatively fixed
structure.  For most objects in a chart you always have at most one instance.
For example, there may only be one main title object and one legend.  Only the
number of data series and data points inside of series may change, which depends
directly on the dimension of the input data.</p>

<p>There is only one page in a chart.  On this page there are the following
top level objects:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Titles (main title, subtitle, axis titles)</li>
 <li>Legend</li>
 <li>Diagram</li>
 <li>Additional shapes (see <a href="#add-shapes">section 4</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The page's background color is determined by the chart area object, which is
the object that you can select via the GUI to format the background of the
entire space a chart document occupies.</p>

<p>The Diagram is the object containing the actual plot.  In three-dimensional
charts the diagram is a scene object.  There are four kinds of sub-objects in
the diagram:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Series representing parts of the data (see <a href="#series">section 3</a>)</li>
 <li>Axes (primary x/y/z axis, secondary x/y axis)</li>
 <li>Grids (major and minor grids)</li>
 <li>Wall, and floor for three-dimensional charts</li>
</ul>

<p>The number of objects we are dealing with here is limited to a small constant
for all objects except the series.  These can vary in number depending on the
size of the input data; however usually, this number should also be small.
Having more than ten, or so, series usually doesn't make much sense.  In
contrast, the series themselves can contain a lot of data points.  This might
become a problem for AT (Assistive Technology) tool.  We will discuss this
issue in the following section.</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
<h3><a name="series">3. Data Series and Data Points</a></h3>

<p>As stated before, the number of series usually is small.  So, we assume not
having problems here.  However, the number of data points contained in a series
may be huge, and although you may not be able to really distinguish all points
from each other on a screen, they are all visible in the current window, thus
have to be made accessible.</p>

<p>Consider a chart where you have five series, each representing 2,000 data
points displayed as little symbols.  You can select every of those points
(e.g. via the keyboard) and give it a different formatting, thus you should also
provide them as objects in the document tree for getting notified on selection.
As a result we would get 10,000 objects in the tree for those objects.  This
will consume a lot of time and also memory.  Maybe a tool might even crash when
getting such a lot of nodes, because normally you do not have so many objects in
a document that are all visible at the same time (especially in dialogs, for
which most tools were initially designed).  There are several solutions to this
problem, which we want to discuss next.</p>

<h4>Assume that AT-Tools are Clever</h4>

<p>An AT-tool may feel free to query the number of children and accessible
object has.  If it turns out that this number is quite high (according to some
threshold), the tool could simply not request those objects.  Even on rendering,
those objects could be omitted, because their bounding boxes must all lie in the
bounding box of the parent element.</p>

<p>However, if a user travels down the document to a series, the tool would most
probably load all children to offer them to the user.  Alternatively the tool
could just state how many children there are, and the user could select the
<em>n</em><sup>th</sup> child without knowing what this child <em>looks</em>
like.</p>

<p>The question here mainly is, if AT-tools will be enhanced when the
requirements increase for using StarOffice/OpenOffice.org.  As this does not lie
in our hands, this way has a certain risk.</p>

<h4>Offer only those Data Points that have their Own Attributes</h4>

<p>When you create a chart from scratch, all data points have no own attributes.
Instead they inherit their appearance from the series.  A user can select a data
point and apply different properties to it.  Internally, there is a list of all
data points that differ from the default, i.e., have been modified by a user.
The number of modified data points usually is also small.</p>

<p>This way, a user accessing a document via an AT-tool could get information
about all data points that are differently formatted.  For example, if a series
has a blue fill color, and one data point is made red to underline its
importance, the user would have access to it.  However, the user would not be
able to select an unformatted data point to apply a different color herself.</p>

<h4>Do not offer Data Points at All</h4>

<p>The data points are usually not formatted differently from the series.  And
even if some points are differently formatted, the question remains if a user is
interested in that.  One important property of a data point is its value.  But
the value can be found in the underlying data table, which is also accessible.
So we could generally ignore data points.</p>

<p>The only downside of this is that you can select data points via the GUI,
e.g., the keyboard.  When doing so you would get an object that is not
accessible from the view.</p>

<h4>Offer Data Points dependent on Chart Type</h4>

<p>If you take for example pie charts, you will notice that there will usually
not be too many data points, otherwise you could not really interpret this chart
visually (which is the main purpose of a chart).  And also bar charts, mostly
used in business graphics, do not have too many bars.</p>

<p>The most prominent examples for charts that may represent huge amount of
data, are line charts and xy-charts (scatter charts).  Those two chart types
also have subtypes that contain just the lines and no symbols.  In this case
there simply do not exist any data points.  Thus, the problematic situation is
(under our previous assumptions) having a line- or scatter chart using symbols
for a lot of data points.</p>

<p>One solution (which in fact solves the problem just under the assumptions
made) would be not to offer any data points for certain chart types, namely
line- and scatter charts (and maybe radar charts).</p>

<h4>Offer Data Points dependent on the Quantity</h4>

<p>As we can never be sure that there are no bar charts with thousands of bars,
the previous approach may fail.  So we could use a heuristic that children are
only created, if their number is smaller than a given constant threshold.  This
way we would be on the safe side.  We would also have no problems for all types
of charts having only a small number of data points per series.</p>

<p>A remaining problem would still be the inconsistency, that you could select
data points via the GUI (the keyboard) but would not get accessible objects from
the selection.  However, this seems to me the most promising approach at the
moment.</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
<h3><a name ="add-shapes">4. Additional Shapes</a></h3>

<p>You can add additional shapes to a chart.  When being inserted via the
clipboard those shapes are always meta-files or bitmaps.  These shapes can be
treated the same way as shapes in the Draw/Impress.  In other words, we can get
an XShape from the drawing layer that supports all necessary accessibility
capabilities.</p>

<!-- ---------------------------------------- -->
<h3>4. Visibility</h3>

<p>The tree of accessible objects is always constructed of the objects that are
in the current scope of the screen.  Charts may only be OLE objects, and the
view for an OLE object is only created when it is entered in <em>In-Place
mode</em>.  On activation the OLE-object is moved such that it is completely
visible, unless its size exceeds the size of the window.  This is the only
(rare) situation when not all objects of a chart may be visible.</p>

<p>Apart from that, consider a bar chart where the rightmost bar is not in the
current scope.  I think it doesn't make much sense to offer all data series, but
one series has one data point less than the others, just because it is not
visible.</p>

<p>Therefore I suggest to always offer the complete tree of objects, no matter
if really everything is visible.</p>

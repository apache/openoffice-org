  <h1>OpenOffice Accessibility Project</h1>
  <h3>Project Goal</h3>
  <P>Making OpenOffice accessible means to make it usable by people
regardless of their disabilities. 
</P>
  <P>There are various Accessibility aspects: Keyboard navigation,
scheming, AT support and much more. 
</P>
  <P>Details can be found here:
<A HREF="https://ui.openoffice.org/accessibility/whitepaper.html">https://ui.openoffice.org/accessibility/whitepaper.html</A>.
</P>
  <h3>Making OpenOffice accessible</h3>
  <P>There are three strategies to make OpenOffice accessible: 
</P>
  <UL>
   <LI><B>Keyboard navigation</B>
   <P>Allow the user to control OpenOffice completely with the
	keyboard so that the use of a mouse is not necessary.</P>
   <P>OpenOffice is already controllable in large parts via the
	keyboard. As open task remain for instance switching into and
	between dialogs and activating and deactivating OLE objects.</P>
   <LI><B>Visual and keyboard enhancements</B>
   <P>Keyboard enhancements comprise the support of keyboard like input
	devices that differ from standard keyboards. This support is covered
	by the operating systems that OpenOffice runs on.</P>
   <P>Visual enhancements like enlarged and clearer fonts are already
	possible with the existing OpenOffice.</P>
   <LI><B>Assistive technology</B>
   <P>Assistive technology comprise such different devices like screen
	readers and braille terminals. There are several APIs that serve as
	common abstraction of the various AT input and output devices. We
	are aiming at the Java Accessibility API as the only truly operating
	system independent member of that group while at the same time
	keeping an eye on the Gnome Accessibility API. Both are very similar
	in the way they represent an application and the kind of information
	they provide for the individual parts of the (G)UI.</P>
   <P>Our approach of supporting AT with the UNO Accessibility API is
	documented <A HREF="at-support.html">here</A> in detail.</P>
	<P>A list of AT known to work with OpenOffice is maintained on
	<A HREF="https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Accessibility">https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Accessibility</A>.</P>

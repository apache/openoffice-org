<h2>Document representation guidelines</h2>

<p><em>Last modification on October 31st 2001.</em></p>

<p>The following list contains a set of guidelines for the representation of
StarOffice/OpenOffice.org documents with the UNO Accessibility API (UAA).
The intention of these guidelines is to define--in an application unspecific
way--what kind of information of a document should expose over the UAA.  It
thus complements the syntactic specification made by the actual UAA
definition.</p>

<p>It is not the goal of these guidelines to give a detailed description of
how to represent documents of the individual applications.  That is done at
another place.
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>View based approach</b><br>
<p>In order to let people that use different interfaces--for example the
OpenOffice.org GUI or a Braille display--help each other with working on a
document all of them need to have access to an <em>equivalent</em>
representation of that document.  We think that the best way to achieve this
goal is to use the current GUI as a reference and to expose all information
over the UAA that is available over the GUI.</p>

<p>We are, of course, aware of the fact that the information available over
the UAA will not be completely equivalent to that available over the GUI.
Content of graphical objects for example can be exposed only rudimentary.</p>

<p>This approach is called view based as opposed to a structure or content
based approach that would focus not on the graphical appearance on the screen,
but on the structure of a document's content.</p>

<p>Consequences of employing the view based approach are for instance that in
a Writer document a text paragraph may be split into several portions
according to its layout on the screen.  Another example is the exposure of how
text is broken into lines.</p>

<p>A further reason to favor the view based approach over the content based
one is the better consistency with the WYSIWYG paradigm.</p>
<br>
</li>


<li><b>Keep it simple</b><br>

<p>The idea behind this rule is to keep the <em>structure</em> of the UAA
document representation as simple as possible while at the same time give
access to as much of a document's semantical <em>content</em> as possible.
One way to achieve that is to remove nodes from the representation tree that
expose no content by themselves but serve only as container for other
objects.  Such container nodes should be used only in selected places.</p>

<p>The reason for this is a pragmatically one.  Current AT devices can't cope
with information with a structure that is overly complex.  Moreover, no AT
vendor will invest much time and money into supporting an API that differs too
much from their current source of information.</p>
<br></li>


<li><b>Don't represent objects that lie completely off-screen</b><br>

<p>There are two reasons for this rule.  The first one is to keep the document
representation consistent with what is visible on the screen.  If document
parts not visible on the screen where given access to via the UAA each AT
device had to figure out on its own what parts are visible and shall be
exposed to the user and which parts to hold back.</p>

<p>The second reason is the reduction of the amount of data that has to be
transmitted from application to AT.  This point is mainly relevant when
application and AT are not running on the same computer.  When exposing the
whole document over the UAA the AT would have to probe a lot of objects in
order to determine the visible ones.</p>

<p>There is one exception to not represent off-screen objects.  Calc tables
will give access to all their cells at once regardless of whether they are
on- or off-screen.  There are again two reasons for this.  The first is
consistency with existing implementations of the AccessibleTable interface
like the javax.swing.JTable.AccessibleJTable class.  The second reason has
to do with cell indices.  When only the visible cells would be represented
scrolling the document would result in each cell getting new indices--relative
to the upper left visible cell--assigned.  This would render using indices
virtually useless.  Representing all cells leads to indices that remain
unchanged by scrolling.</p>

<p>There still remains the issue of partially visible document parts.  Some,
like text paragraphs, may be split into on- and off-screen parts.  If that
is not possible partially visible objects are handled exactly like
completely visible objects.</p>

<p>Use the VISIBLE and SHOWING states to appropriately mark objects.  If
they are completely or partially visible on the screen they are VISIBLE
<em>and</em> SHOWING.  Objects contained in the UAA representation tree,
that lie outside the visible area are marked as VISIBLE <em>but not</em>
SHOWING.</p> <br></li>

<li><b>Don't represent hidden objects</b><br> 

<p>This is very similar to the previous rule.  Objects that have been
actively marked as hidden are not visible on the screen and therefore are
not represented by the API.</p> <br></li>

<li><b>Do not represent the cursor position explicitly beyond the means of
AccessibleText</b><br>

<p>The cursor position, i.e. the position at which text typed on the
keyboard will be inserted into a document, has not to be explicitely exposed
by the UAA e.g. by providing special AccessibleAction objects.  It is taken
care of by sending events with every change of the cursor position, which
contain information about the AccessibleText object which contains the
cursor.  This object can then be queried for the caret position.</p>

<h2>Accessibility Work Bench</h2>
<em>A test tool for the UNO Accessibility API</em><br><br>
<em>Last changed on April 25th 2003</em>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Accessibility Work Bench, or AWB for short, is a tool for testing the
accessibility implementation of OpenOffice/StarOffice that uses the UNO
Accessibility API (UAA) directly.  There are other tools that use the Java
Accessibility API (JAA).  The AWB is implemented in Java.  Its purpose is to give
developers of the UAA a tool to aid them in testing and debugging their
implementation.</p> 

<h3>Latest Version is 1.7</h3>
The current version is 1.7.  The CVS tag is v1_7.  Changes since the last
version are:
<ul>
<li>Integrated move of UAA files from drafts to final.</li>
<li>Control left click in the graphical view expands the object that has
  been clicked at.</li>

<li>Introduction of split panes for easily changing the size of the three
main widgets.</li>

<li>The graphical view visualizes the screen size.</li>

<li>Removed the "Load" button.</li>
<li>Removed the status line.</li>
<li>New "views" menu that allows you to select the zoom scale of the
  graphical view.</li>
<li>New "help" menu gives access to some (hopefully) helpful information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Start Up</h3>
<p>First be sure to compile the java source code by simply calling dmake.
Before you start the AWB make sure that you have an Office running that
accepts connections from outside.  Start the Office like <br>
<nobr><code>soffice
        "-accept=socket,host=localhost,port=5678;urp;"</code>.</nobr><br>
If you are unhappy with the port number you can change that but remember to
tell the AWB of this.  There are two ways to start the AWB:
<ol>
<li>From a solar environment just call <code>dmake run</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise you have to specify the place of all necessary jar files with <code>java
-classpath
.:&lt;path-to-jar-files&gt;/unoil.jar:&lt;path-to-jar-files&gt;/sandbox.jar:&lt;path-to-jar-files&gt;/ridl.jar:&lt;path-to-jar-files&gt;/jurt.jar:&lt;path-to-jar-files&gt;/juh.jar:&lt;path-to-jar-files&gt;/java_uno.jar

AccessibilityWorkBench</code> where &lt;path-to-jar-files&gt; has to be
replaced with the name of the path where the jar file live.  So, if you an
office installed at <code>/home/af/office</code> then the command line is <code>java -classpath .:/home/af/office/program/classes/unoil.jar:/home/af/office/program/classes/sandbox.jar:/home/af/office/program/classes/ridl.jar:/home/af/office/program/classes/jurt.jar:/home/af/office/program/classes/juh.jar:/home/af/office/program/classes/java_uno.jar AccessibilityWorkBench</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The AWB understands one option:
<ul>
<li>-p &lt;port-number&gt; changes the port number at which the AWB tries to
  connect to the Office.  It defaults to 5678.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Graphical User Interface</h3>
<img src="awb.png" title="Screenshot of the AWB at work">
<p>The (somewhat outdated) image shows a screenshot of the AWB displaying the accessibility
information of a char document.  The most important parts of the AWB
GUI are:
<ul>
<li>The tree view on the left side displays the accessibility tree.  The
nodes on the second level represent the document windows of the Office.
Nodes on higher levels represent parts of these documents.  Double left clicking on
a tree node expands it.  This may take a while because the tool reads
information about each new child node from the Office.  Leafs of the tree
show information about details of the various UAA interfaces. Single left
clicks on an internal node highlights the corresponding graphical
representation.  Right (OS dependant) clicking on a node pops up a context
sensitive menu that allows you to expand the subtree (all nodes or just the
shapes) or to do other, context dependant, things.</li>
<li>The graphical view of the accessibility objects is located on the right
side of the tree view.  The objects are shown with their bounding boxes
outlined or filled with the colors derived from the
XAccessibleExtendedComponent interface.  If that is not supported default
colors are used.  An object is drawn filled if it contains no children and
draw as a rectangle when it does.  Holding the shift key while moving the
mouse highlights the object the mouse pointer is over.  Also the
corresponding node in the tree view is selected.  The same is done for a
left click (without a modifier.)  Name and description are shown if not
deselected in the option menu.</li>
<li>Into the output area below the graphical view various messages are
printed indicating success or failure of certain operations or that give
feedback during longer operations.  If for instance no Office can be found
to which the AWB can connect it says so in this area and prints the command
line argument that you can use to start the Office in a way that allows
connection to the AWB.</li>
<li>The status line below the text and the graphical view shows temporary
messages indicating what goes on in the AWB.</li>
<li>The button bar at the bottom contains the following buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Connect</b> connects to an Office that has been started after the
AWB.  A connection with an already running Office is established
automatically at start up time.</li>
<li><b>Update</b> Clears tree view and graphical view and re-reads the
visible document windows.  Use this button after loading a new document into
the Office to tell the AWB of it.</li>
<li><b>Expand Shapes</b> expands all nodes in the tree view that represent
  draw shapes.  Use the context menu to expand shapes more selectively.</li>
<li><b>Expand All</b> expands all nodes in the tree view.  Use the context
  menu to expand nodes more selectively.</li>
<li><b>Quit</b> exits from the AWB without asking for confirmation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></p>

  accessible through the Help-&gt;Help menu item.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>
The source code of the AWB is located in the test/accessibility directory of
the toolkit project. You have to do a checkout from the CVS repository with
a command like <code>cvs checkout toolkit/test/accessibility</code> after
setting up the proper CVS server and logging in to it.  Use a tag like v1_7
to check out a specific version.  You can browse it <a 
href="http://ui.openoffice.org/source/browse/toolkit/test/accessibility/"
title="Browse the AWB source code">here</a>.

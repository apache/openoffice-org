<H1>Proposal for an Accessibility API in StarOffice Writer</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>In the following proposal it is assumed that StarOffice's
Accessibility API is based on the Java Accessibility API. For that
reason, it is very often referred to classes and interfaces of that
API. The classes and interfaces mentioned are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>class AccessibleContext: An object (for instance a button)
	may support an interface Accessible. In this case, one can retrieve
	an object of class AccessibleContext from the object. An object of
	class AccessibleContext has some methods that support Assistive
	Technology tools, for instance by assigning a role and a description
	to the original object. The AccessibleContext objects for a certain
	dialog, or for a document, might be arranged to a tree there each
	AccessibleContext is a node of this tree. The structure of such
	trees is discussed below.</P>
	<LI><P>AccessibleEditableText is an interface that offers access to
	text as well as methods to modify the text. It might be supported by
	objects of class AccessibleContext.</P>
	<LI><P>AccessibleComponent is an interface that might be supported
	by an AccessibleContext and describes the position and size of an
	object that is displayed on the screen relative to the parent
	AccessibleContext.</P>
	<LI><P>AccessibleAction is an interface that might be supported by
	an AccessibleContext. It offers the possibility to trigger (custom)
	operations that are applied to that object.</P>
</UL>
<P>The proposal for an Accessibility API  for StarOffice Writer
described in this document is still incomplete. It mainly covers the
following areas:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The representation of the current text position (i.e. the
	text cursor).</P>
	<LI><P>The conflict between an AccessibleContext tree that
	represents the current view and an AccessibleContext tree that
	represents the whole document based on its logical structure.</P>
</UL>
<H2>The Text Cursor</H2>
<P>In current word processors as well as in simple text editors,
there is the concept of a text cursor. That is a position there any
insertion, deletion, change, etc. takes place. These operations can
be triggered for instance by a key stroke or by selecting a menu
item.=20
</P>
<P>Within a tree of AccessibleContexts it's quite difficult to
represent a text cursor. Even if the leafs of an AccessibleContext
tree would be characters (regardless whether this is sensible), there
would not be a position between to leafs. It also seems not to be
convenient that the text cursor is an AccessibleContext itself. The
result would be that every move of the text cursor would change the
AccessibleContext tree.</P>
<P>However, the problem is already solved within the
AccessibleEditableText interface. This interface on the one hand
offers methods to retrieve a word, character or sentence at a certain
character position within some text. On the other hand, it offers
methods to set and get a caret and a selection within the text, where
a caret is a selection that has the same character start and end
position. This is nearly the same as a traditional text cursor,
except that a text cursor not only denotes a position within a
paragraph but also a certain paragraph. In contrast to this, the
AccessibleEditableText does not have the concept of paragraphs at
all.</P>
<P>To be able to use the AccessibleEditableText interface anyway, one
has to specify that each paragraph is represented by an=20
AccessibleEditableText interface of its own. Disregarding things like
text boxes and footnotes, paragraphs in this case are leafs of the
AccessibleContext tree that additionally support the
AccessibleEditableText interface.</P>
<P>However, what's still missing is a way to mimic the paragraph
position of a traditional text cursor. This could be done by making
it possible to give a focus not only to controls but also to
paragraphs. In other words, if there is not eventually a text box or
some other kind of non paragraph object selected, there always is one
paragraph that has the focus. Any operation within the paragraph is
done by the  AccessibleEditableText interface. Or in other words
again, within the Accessibility API the paragraph position of a
traditional text cursor is represented by assigning the focus the
paragraphs itself while its character position is mapped to the caret
of the paragraph's  AccessibleEditableText interface.</P>
<H2>The visual and the logical AccessibleContext Tree</H2>
<P>A tree of AccessibleContext either may represent a document's
logical structure or its representation as printed or displayed on a
screen. Moreover, it may either represent a full document or just a
part of it.</P>
<P>Having the logical tree of the whole document on the one hand
makes powerful AT tools possible, on the other hand it might be the
case that these tools have to be powerful to be able to handle the
large amount of information they get. However, to make such tools
possible, a tree like this should be existing.</P>
<P>Another tree that seems to be necessary is a tree that represents
the current view of the document as displayed on the screen. This has
several reasons. First of all, there might be situations where one
can see the screen view, but needs AT tools for input or to get
additional information. In this case, it seems to be an advantage if
the AT tool may operate on exactly the same data that is displayed on
the screen.</P>
<P>Another reason is that this tree simplifies the interoperation
between traditional UI operations and and the AccessibleContext tree.
 It's hard to image how an UI operation could be applied to some data
if these data is not visible, but its also seems to be impossible to
make any operation that can be triggered using the UI available to
the Accessibility API, too.=20
</P>
<P>Last but not least an AccessibleContext tree bases on the current
screen view is required if a blind and a non blind shall have a look
at the same document. For instance, if a blind wants to know what is
shown in an image it's required that he can make the image visible on
the screen. Moreover, it seems to be convenient that he can describe
the position of the image on the screen instead of having to describe
where it is located in the logical tree of the document.</P>
<P>Another possibility, having a tree that represents only a part of
the document, seems to be not convenient, because this would be a sub
tree of the whole document only. A tree that represents the whole
document but in the way it is displayed at the screen or printed
might be more convenient. However, having the possibility to navigate
through the document like it is done on the screen should be
sufficient. Therefor, I pay no attention to these to possibilities
here. For convenience, the tree that represents the whole document
logically is called logical tree in this document. The tree that
represents the document's view on the screen is called screen tree.</P>
<P>As mentioned above, it seems to be necessary that using the
Accessibility API makes it further possible to use the UI. Many UI
operations take the current text cursor position into account. Using
the above representation of the text cursor as a focus of a paragraph
and a caret in this paragraph, this is no problem for the screen
tree. The only thing that has to be ensured is that the state of the
tree and the text cursor are synchronized. This in fact, should be
the expected behavior anyway.</P>
<P>Making the the logical tree and the UI working together is not
much harder anyway. A prerequisite for this is that there is exactly
one AccessibleContext for any object that can be contained in the
logical as well as in  the screen tree, for instance for a paragraph.
In other words, one and the same AccessibleContext has to be
contained in the logical as well as the screen tree if it belongs to
the same object, for instance a paragraph. What's missing then is a
possibility to assign the focus to a certain paragraph. This most
probably can be  done by the AccessibleComponent interface (if one
specifies that it is available for AcessibleContexts that are no
visible currently, too), or it can be implemented by an
AccessibleAction. Assigning the focus to an AccessibleContext has to
make the paragraph visible on the screen. This way, it's possible to
navigate and operate on the logical tree, but also to use the UI by
assigning the focus to a certain paragraph. The screen tree in this
case might offer an additional help, but of course it's not required
to use it.</P>
<H2>Other Objects, Like Tables Or Drawings</H2>
<P>The above proposal can be extended to other objects like tables or
drawings by specifying that these objects, or the objects they
consist of, may get a focus, too.</P>
<H2>The Logical Tree</H2>
<P>It's quite obvious that the logical tree should reflect the
chapter/sub section structure of a document. The remaining issue is
how detailed the tree should be. It seems to be sensible that the
tree should contain any object that may get the focus and that might
get visible.</P>
<H2>The Screen Tree</H2>
<P>The structure the screen tree should have is not as obvious as the
one of the logical tree. One possibility might be to have a root that
corresponds to the visible area of the document. The visible
paragraphs might be children of the root directly. But it also might
be a solution that the root contains a body, a header, a footer and a
footnote area as children, where any of these areas is optional, and
that these areas contain the visible paragraphs. However, there seems
to be no reason to include nodes for chapters or sub sections into
the screen tree. The screen tree and the logical tree are tied as
close together that these information can be obtained from the
logical tree at any time.</P>
<P>One issue regarding the screen tree is the fact that a paragraph
might be visible partially only or might be split by a page break.
The first problem might be addresses by an enhanced
AccessibleComponent interface that provides information which parts
of the paragraph are visible. The second problem might be addressed
by having a list of AccessibleComponents instead of a single one.</P>

<h2> Overview </h2>

			<P>UNO is a component model that offers inter-operability between
			different programming languages, different objects models,
			different machine architectures, and different processes; either in a
			LAN or via the Internet. 
			</P>
			<P>The <A HREF="#applications">StarOffice and Sun ONE Webtop</A>
			products have proven the usability of UNO in complex real world
			applications. Developers that want to use, extend, or modify the
			functionality of one of the products will do this using UNO. 
			</P>
			<P>UNO is not limited to the above applications. The base
			libraries of UNO are independent of StarOffice and can be used as
			a framework for other applications. 
			</P>
			<P>UNO is freely available (it is distributed under <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/license.html">ALv2</a>) and currently supports Java, C and C++ (on windows, Linux,
			and Solaris). A bridge for COM OLE Automation already exists. 
			</P>
			<P>UNO is developed by the OpenOffice.org community including the Sun
			Microsystems development labs.<!-- ******************************************************
* TECHNICAL DETAILS
******************************************************
 -->
						</P>
<h2><a name="tech_details"></A> Some technical details </h2>

<P>UNO is interface based, as are COM and CORBA. Components implement
			interfaces compliant to their interface specification. Multiple
			components communicate only via their interfaces. This allows 
			implementing one component in a different language or to move an
			implementation to another machine, without modifying the other's
			components. This gives you huge flexibility and preserves earlier
			invested efforts. 
			</P>
			<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Each component lives in a <STRONG>U</STRONG>no
			<STRONG>R</STRONG>untime <STRONG>E</STRONG>nvironment (<STRONG>URE</STRONG>).
			A URE is identified by the implementation language (e.g., C++,
			Java, <SPAN LANG="en-US">Perl</SPAN>, ...) and the current
			process. There is no performance overhead for components, that are
			instantiated within the same URE, e.g., in C++, a call from
			component A to B is just a virtual call. The calls between
			components from different UREs are bridged by UNO. 
			</P>

<center><img src="images/component_environments.gif" name="Grafik1" align=middle width=511 height=294 border=0 alt="Connecting Environments"/></center>

			<P>In general, calls are bridged through a single <EM>dispatch</EM>
			method. This method is, in general, easy to implement for 
			interprocess bridges or bridges to interpreting languages. There
			is <STRONG>no generated code</STRONG> for stubs or<SPAN LANG="en-US">
			proxies. </SPAN>All necessary conversions are done by the generic
			dispatch method. The information about the method signature is
			retrieved dynamically from a <STRONG>type library</STRONG>. This
			type library is reused by every bridge, so only the number of
			entries in the type library grows with a growing number of types.
			This reduces build time and memory consumption at runtime;
			nevertheless, bridging is as fast as generated code. 
			</P>
			<P>UNO-interfaces are specified in IDL. All UNO-interfaces must be
			derived from a superinterface, that offers acquire, release, and a
			queryInterface method (comparable to COM). The lifetime of
			UNO-objects is controlled by <STRONG>global reference counting</STRONG>.
			<STRONG>Exceptions</STRONG> are used for error handling. 
			</P>
			<P>UNO guarantees <STRONG>object identity</STRONG>, <STRONG>thread
			identity</STRONG>, and the <STRONG>sequence of calls</STRONG>. 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<li>object identity<br/>
				Two interfaces' references can be compared for equality. UNO
				guarantees, that the result is correct, no matter whether the
				result is true or false. 

				<li>thread identity<br/>
				In UNO every
				thread is named by a globally unique thread identifier. A thread
				leaving the process via an interprocess bridge is identified when
				entering the process, again, some callstack levels higher. The same
				thread will execute the new call thus guaranteeing that any
				thread dependent resources stay the same (such as thread local
				storage, lock of mutexes, etc.).

				<li>sequence of calls<br/>
				UNO allows declaring a method oneway
				(or asynchron). Multiple, oneway calls are guaranteed to be
				executed in the same sequence as they were called. 

			</UL>
			<P>A sequence of oneway calls can be<SPAN LANG="en-US">
			transferred </SPAN>and executed extremely fast via an interprocess
			connection. The UNO interprocess protocol is optimized for low
			bandwidth connections. 
			</P>

<h2><a name="applications"></a> Applications built on UNO </h2>

<P>This chapter discusses some actual use cases of UNO and the benefits
the applications derived from UNO.</P>

<h3>StarOffice (or OpenOffice.org)</h3>

			<P>StarOffice is a fully featured office productivity suite. 
			</P>
			<P>StarOffice mainly uses the C++ -in-process functionality of
			UNO. Before UNO, the StarOffice development suffered very much from
			incompatible changes (e.g., adding a new virtual method or a new
			member to a class) in one of the base libraries. This forced a
			complete rebuild of the product, which roughly consumed 2 days and
			was done only once a week. These incompatible updates were be
			reduced considerably by using UNO, and as a result the whole work became
			more efficient. Please have a look at this document, 
			<A HREF="uno_the_idea.html">Uno the Idea</A>, for a more complete explanation. 
			</P>
			<P>Java components in StarOffice (e.g., the pgp-integration) use
			the Java-C++ bridge to access the StarOffice API. External
			developers can easily integrate their desired<SPAN LANG="en-US">
			functionality </SPAN>in StarOffice using this bridge. 
			</P>
			<P>External developers can use the UNO-interprocess bridge to
			access StarOffice-API from a different process for remote office
			control. 
			</P>

<h3>Sun ONE Webtop</h3>

			<P>Sun ONE Webtop is a highly distributed application. It provides
			a fully featured office productivity suite via the Internet.
			Office documents can be accessed via various clients
			(WebBrowser-Plugins, PDAs, HTML-Clients, etc.).</P>
			<P>UNO is used in the communication between the WebBrowser-Plugin
			and the office application server. All outputdevice-calls (e.g.,
			DrawRect, DrawLine, and SetColor) necessary to paint a scene are
			transmitted via the Internet connection (the necessary performance
			is reached by declaring those calls oneway).</P>
			<P>UNO is used to bridge between <STRONG>Java Server Pages</STRONG>
			(running within the webserver) and the Universal Content Broker (a
			C++ process that is responsible for data access).<!-- ******************************************************
* OTHER COMPONENT MODELS
******************************************************
 -->
						</P>

<h2><a name="other_models"></a> UNO, COM, CORBA, and Java RMI </h2>

			<P>It is often asked, why a new component model (UNO) has been
			developed, instead of using already existing ones (such as
			COM/DCOM, CORBA, or Java RMI). The main reason is that the other
			object models don't provide the functionality needed for
			applications such as StarOffice or Sun ONE Webtop. 
			</P>
			<UL>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">COM/DCOM does not allow for use
				of exceptions, which is of eminent important for advanced error
				handling. 
				</P>
				<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">CORBA is only a standard for
				remote communication, there is only very poor support for in
				process<SPAN LANG="en-US"> communication </SPAN>(IIOP in
				process), which is too slow for most applications. See also the 
				<A HREF="comparison_uno_corba.html">CORBA-UNO comparison document</A>
								</P>
				<LI><P>Java RMI is only useful within a Java environment, but there
				is a need for a technology for bridging between different
				languages. 
				</P>
			</UL>
			<P>Additionally, the code generation needed, e.g., in COM or CORBA,
			results in huge libraries if there are many types. For each new
			bridge, new generated glue code would be necessary, which becomes
			too difficult to handle. 
			</P>

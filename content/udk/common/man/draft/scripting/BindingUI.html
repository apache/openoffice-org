<h2>Binding and the Binding UI</h2>
     
<h3>Information about binding and the binding UI</h3>
    <i><b> Loading of macros</b></i>  
<p>  The loading of macros is done through a BasicManager       (basic/source/basmgr/basmgr.cxx). 
Each document has a    BasicManager associated with it, and the application 
has a BasicManager has well.  Each BasicManager has a stream, which is the 
content of the  macros from their context (i.e. application or document). 
Macros have their own URL within Star/OpenOffice.org which is of the form
macro://&lt;path&gt;/&lt;library&gt;.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt; 
  </p>
 
<p>  <i><b>Populating Dialogs</b></i> </p>
 
<p>           For populating the dialogs, the SfxConfigGroupListBox_Impl 
          (sfx2/source/dialog/cfg.cxx) queries the application's        
   BasicManager for a list of macros and then queries every open        
   document's BasicManager for their associated macros. The           SfxConfigGroupListBox_Impl 
builds up a list of macros, which it             populates the dialog box 
with.     </p>
 
<p>  <i><b>Assignment of Macros to Events</b></i> </p>
 
<p>           Assignment of a macro to an event is done by the           
AssignDeleteHdl_Impl in _SfxMacroTabPage            (sfx2/source/dialog/macropg.cxx), 
when the "Assign" button is            pressed, it deletes any already assign 
macros to the event. Then             assigns the new macro to the event. 
An assignment is just an            event id with a macro name attached to 
it.   </p>
 
<p>  <i>Comments from Mathias Bauer in italics (and similar in the following 
sections).</i> </p>
 
<p>  <i> This is the "old" view. Our new API describes events by names, but 
the    dialog still uses the old API, and there is some code that mediates 
  between both APIs. The configuration dialogs will be replaced   completely 
later, so we didn't want to invest here. Forget about the   event Ids. </i></p>
 
<p> <i> The "real" assignment inside the document and the way this is stored 
  uses the com::sun::star::document::XEventSupplier and   com::sun::star::document::XEventBroadcaster 
API where an office   document supports the event supplier interface, that 
provides a   container to bind events (described by a name) to a script (only 
  StarBasic in the current implementation). More about that see below. </i> 
 </p>
 
<p><i><b>Execution of Macros</b></i></p>
 
<p> The various document types, e.g. SwXTextDocument, are subclasses  of the
SfxBaseModel. When an event is generated, it gets passed  (how?) to the Notify
method of the SfxBaseModel. This does ??,  and makes a call to postEventImpl, 
passing in an SfxEventHint. </p>
 
<p><i> As already mentioned the SFX still contains a lot of code using the old 
API,   so the document based events are still created as SfxEventHints by 
the  SFX representation of the document, the subclass of SfxObjectShell. 
 The model object is a listener to this object, and so it gets notified 
(the SfxBroadcaster/SfxListener pair implementation is used for that).  Then 
the model itself broadcasts the event, but now it uses the event  name, not 
the Id it got from the SfxObjectShell as a part of the  SfxEventHint. So every
listener that is registered using the new, UNO  based API (and not the C++
class SfxListener) is notified also.   </i></p>
 
<p> <i>There is one special listener that always registers for event  notifications. 
This listener makes a lookup in a table to find a macro  that is bound to 
the event in question, and if it finds one, it calls  the macro.</i>    </p>
 
<p> The postEvent_Impl gets the InterfaceContainer   (::cppu::OInterfaceContainerHelper),
and gets an     InterfaceIterator (::cppu::OInterfaceIteratorHelper) from
it. It   then calls notifyEvent on each of the XEventListeners returned  
by the iterator.    </p>
<p><i>Exactly. This is the "real" event handling, take all the previous  
stuff as mutable implementation detail, because at the end it's not important
how the model gets notified that an event wants to be notified!</i><br/>
</p>
<p>    In various methods on the SfxObjectShell we see direct calls to  
the SfxApplication::NotifyEvent method with various   SfxEventHints such
as SFX_EVENT_LOADFINISHED (defined in   svtools?) . Also seen in methods
on SfxViewFrame. The   SfxObjectShell source also shows a number of Broadcast
calls.   This is a method inherited from the SfxBroadcaster. Do these   have
some significance?    </p>
<p><i>   Partly. Every document based events that is created inside an SFX
   based document is broadcasted by calling SfxApplication::NotifyEvent.
   This method uses SfxEventConfiguration::ExecuteEvent that did the   whole
job in SO5. "The whole job" means that it called both globally   and document
specific bound macros.    In SO6/OOo we replaced the binding mechanism for
documents by a new   API as mentioned above. So this part of the "job" was
removed from the   SfxEventconfiguration, as you can see in the code: this
method quits   the job, if the document itself has a bound macro. This macro
will be   called by the process described above. The MacroTable of the document
  is only used for the dialog (it is part of the mediating code   mentioned
above), not for the event binding evaluation.      If the document has no
specific binding, the method proceeds with   global bindings. We still need
this, because we don't have a global   event broadcaster and configuration,
so here we use the old MacroTable   stored for the application.    SfxApplication::NotifyEvent
also uses the passed document to force it   to a broadcast the event, and
that's the way our model gets notified   and triggers the notification of
its own listeners as described above.    But the SfxObjectShell does some
more internal broadcasts that are   only internal communications between
the document and its views. So   these "Broadcast" calls are not related
to the configurable events.</i><br/>
</p>
<p>    When the SfxApplication::NotifyEvent is called, the SfxEventHint  
is queried for the SfxObjectShell. If the shell is a document   preview the
method returns. Otherwise it makes a call to    </p>
<p><i>   Previews don't have UI and events. They are just a view. We use
a   complete document to make a preview, so it's necessary to do some   magic
in the code.</i><br/>
</p>
<p>    SfxEventConfiguration::ExecuteEvent. After this call the event   is
broadcast (either synchronously or asynchronously using the   SfxEventAsyncer_Impl).
     When ExecuteEvent is called on an SfxEventConfiguration, it   returns
if the doc is a preview. The next check I really don't    understand, but
it returns if that's the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>It's the check for a document binding as mentioned above, because  
bindings at the document are handled by the new API.</i><br/>
</p>
<p>Otherwise, it attempts to get the macro from the SfxEventConfiguration_Impl's
macro table (SvxMacroTableDtor). If it finds the macro, then what  
happens depends on whether the macro is being called synchronously. If
it is synchronous, then skip the next   paragraph and it calls ExecuteMacro
on the results of a static   call to GetOrCreate on SfxMacroConfig, otherwise
it creates a   new SfxAsyncEvent_Impl.       The SfxAsyncEvent_Impl contains
a Notify method &amp; a Timer to   deal with the possibility that another
StarBasic macro might be   running (it waits until this is done). When the
timer handler   (TimeHdl via macro hackery) is called it gets from the  
 SfxApplication the SfxMacroConfig and calls ExecuteMacro.      The ExecuteMacro
method does some checking to ensure that the    macro is a StarBasic macro,
and sets up some args before calling   Call. This is turn calls Call on an
SbMethod. From there on   we're in StarBasic-land!         </p>
<p><i><b>
Problems coming from the discussion</b></i>  </p>
 
<ul>
   <li>Binding UI uses a C++ API which is language dependant on StarBasic</li>
   <li>Intermediary code between C++ API and UNO-based API for binding and
 execution</li>
   <li>No global broadcaster</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>Tasks to be completed by the scripting teams</h3>
<b>(suggestions coming from discussion of "Binding and the Binding  UI" on
the dev@framework.openoffice.org started on the 17<sup>th</sup> of  June
2002</b>)<br/>
     
<ol>
   <li>finish the scripting API for calling, accessing scripts </li>
   <li>script containers </li>
   <li>storage - preference to access storage is through a URL like
       macro://&lt;path or doc&gt;/&lt;library&gt;.&lt;module&gt;.&lt;method&gt;</li>
   <li>IDE interface </li>
   <li>later implement prototypes </li>
   <li> Specification for the Binding UI</li>
   <li>UNO-Based Binding UI (With help from UI Team)</li>
   <li>Throw out  remaining C++ API code and replace with a UNO-based API
       for binding and invocation</li>
   <li>Implement a "global" broadcaster </li>
</ol>

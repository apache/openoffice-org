<h3>Current StarBasic script threading behaviour</h3>
   
<p> Run the macro from the "Macro" dialogbox. </p>
 
<ul>
  <li>No frozen document you can work on any documents </li>
   <li>Macro running in background </li>
   <li>No macro can be run </li>
 
</ul>
   Assign the macro to the "F10" key. Press that key.  
<ul>
  <li>Active document is frozen </li>
   <li>Other document are not frozen </li>
   <li>Can't run any macro on other document while the macro is still running 
even from the "Macro" dialogbox. </li>
 
</ul>
   While the macro is running, if you open the "Macro" dialogbox, the macro 
is paused  
<ul>
  <li>If you close the dialog box, the macro is resumed </li>
   <li>If you decide to edit a macro, the macro is resumed and you can stop 
the macro from the BASIC editor </li>
   <li>If you switch to the BASIC editor and click on the stop button, the 
macro will be stop but nothing in the UI will be updated until the "Macro" 
dialogbox is closed (this seems to be a bug). </li>

<h3>Event Handling</h3>
   
<p> The OpenOffice process has multiple threads. Any thread that calls Application::Yield 
or Application::Reschedule dispatches GUI events. Dispatching GUI events requires
the SolarMutex, so only one thread at a time can dispatch GUI events. In
practice the "main" OpenOffice thread is the thread that dispatches most GUI
events.  </p>
 
<p> Events can be either synchronous or asynchronous. </p>
 
<p> Synchronous events are handled immediately, that means that the functionality 
bound to the event is invoked immediately from the call stack of the thread 
where the event occurred. The thread is therefore blocked until the event has
been handled. </p>
 
<p> Asynchronous events are placed in a message queue by the thread handling 
the event, and the thread is not blocked, it continues executing. The message 
queue is serviced by any thread which calls Application::Yield or Application::Reschedule.
 </p>

<h3>Options for script threading behaviour</h3>
   
<p> There are two possible threading models that we could use: </p>
 
<ol>
  <li>One script per OpenOffice process - this is the threading model currently 
used by OpenOffice. </li>
   <li>One script per OpenOffice document - this would allow more than one 
script to be run at the same time, but only one script could be run per document 
at a time. The thread running the script would have to grab a document lock 
before invoking the script and release it when the script has completed.
  </li>
 
</ol>
   
<p> The best solution is to implement option 2, and add the possibility to 
configure the threading behaviour so that it acts like option 1 if the user 
wishes to use this behaviour (see Configuration section below). </p>
 
<p> So, how do we implement option 2? From discussions with Mathias Bauer 
and Joerg Budischweski they feel that OpenOffice should manage the spawning 
of the threads which would invoke the scripts. In the case of synchronous 
events the thread handling the event would spawn a thread in which it would 
then invoke the script. In the case of asynchronous threads the thread which 
had grabbed the event off the message queue would spawn a new thread when 
it wanted to invoke a script. In other words the responsibility for managing 
the per document script threads would lie with OpenOffice, not the scripting 
framework. </p>
 
<p> Changes needed: </p>
 
<ul>
  <li>The thread calling XFunction.invoke() (main thread for synchronous
 events, message queue thread for asynchronous events) needs to spawn a 
new thread and call XFunction.invoke() from there. </li>
   <li>The document for which the XFunction is being invoked needs to be
 locked for the duration of XFunction.invoke() (with a documentmutex of 
some sort) so other XFunctions cannot be invoked for that document. The most
difficult thing is that also every view that tries to modify a document must
stick to this rule </li>
 
</ul>

<h3>Issues with allowing one script per document</h3>
   
<p> Because of problems with thread safety in the OpenOffice API it is currently 
unsafe to allow more than one thread to make API calls at the same time. For
this reason there is a global SolarMutex which thread unsafe API implementations 
automatically lock before executing any functionality, and unlock before returning.
The thread calling the OpenOffice API is not aware of this SolarMutex. While
the SolarMutex is grabbed, OpenOffice API calls from other threads will block
until the SolarMutex becomes free. The OpenOffice UI will be frozen while
the SolarMutex is locked.  If a script calls a OpenOffice API, the solarmutex
will be grabbed until the API call returns which would temporarily freeze
all document windows. These freezes may be an unacceptable annoyance to users
and they may prefer that the UI be completely frozen for the duration of
script execution rather than having it freeze unexpectedly. </p>

<h3>Configuration of threading behaviour</h3>
   
<p> The threading behaviour of Office should be configurable so that the user
can switch on/off the one script per document behaviour as they wish. A radio
box should be added to the Scripting pane of the Office options dialog with
the options: </p>
 
<p> Allow only one script to be run by OpenOffice at a time. <br>
 Allow one script per document to be run by OpenOffice at a time </p>

<h3>Identifying script threads in a debugger</h3>
   
<p> The issue here is how we can identify which thread in a OpenOffice process 
is running the script we are interested in debugging. This is possible in 
java using the java.lang.Thread.setName() method. The pairing of script name 
and document name should be sufficient to uniquely identify the appropriate 
thread. </p>
 
<p> <a href="#contents">Contents</a> </p>
 
<hr>  <a name="solarmutex"></a>  
<h3>SolarMutex</h3>
   
<p> A problem could arise if a thread that does not possess the SolarMutex
 tries to execute a script synchronously, because any API call in the script 
can possibly acquire the SolarMutex. This may cause a deadlock, f.e. if the 
thread possessing the SolarMutex waits for a resource that is locked by the 
thread that tries to execute a script synchronously.  So we could add some 
code here, that denies script execution, if it should be done synchronously 
and the SolarMutex is locked. It's better to treat this as an error than taking
the risk of getting a deadlock. <br>
 ======<br>
  suffice to say that for synchronous executions the thread owns the SolarMutex, 
it doesn't need to be the "main" thread. <br>
 ======<br>
  Every not thread safe implementation of our API will acquire the SolarMutex 
in any interface call before anything will be done inside the method. So the
function object doesn't need to care for that <br>
 ======<br>
  the SolarMutex should be locked only inside the API calls (it will be anyway), 
not by the function object (it mustn't, because it doesn't know if it is called
synchronously or not!), the event handler or anybody else.  A big advantage
of this is, that the SolarMutex will be freed between two API calls, giving
the message queue a chance to allow for a minimum responsiveness of the office
process. The script then will work in parallel to the event queue.   Only
for synchronous execution we should try to (!) acquire the SolarMutex before
executing the script as described above. If the try fails, script execution
should be denied. I consider this to be a rare case, currently I can't imagine
that any event that may cause a script execution will occur in a thread without
the SolarMutex. But it's good to handle this case in an appropriate way.

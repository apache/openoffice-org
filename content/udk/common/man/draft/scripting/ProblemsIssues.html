<h1>Scripting Framework Problem Areas &amp; High-Level Issues</h1>
     
<h2>Runtime Container</h2>
 <u>  Problem Statement:  </u><br>
 Scripts are executed within a language specific script runtime. We need
to  define the features of this runtime container and the contract between
the  container and the scripts run in it, with regard to threading, symbol
resolution  and persistence of script related data.    <br>
 <br>
 <u>Requirements:</u>    <br>
 
<ul>
   <li>define the contract between the script container and a script, this 
contract should be language neutral&nbsp;</li>
   <li>define the threading model that script containers should use</li>
   <li>define how symbols are resolved within the script container</li>
   <li>define how symbols conflicts are handled</li>
   <li>define the services the container provides to the script for saving 
state</li>
 
</ul>
 <u>Issues:    </u><br>
 
<ul>
   <li>the requirement for language neutrality will impose restrictions on
  how the contract between the script runtime container  and scripts run
 &nbsp;in the container can be defined</li>
   <li>it would be impossible evaluate our contract against all scripting
languages, so we must select a subset of languages to  use&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
 
<h2>Code Management</h2>
 <u>Problem Statement:</u>    <br>
 Scripts can be in many formats, source or binary, encrypted or obfuscated.
  They can be stored in many locations, eg. a filesystem or a webserver.
They   can be stored as files, or embedded within a file. They can be protected
  by security features such as digital signing.    <br>
 Clients of the scripting framework (eg. StarOffice, IDEs) need to be able 
 to  access these scripts without concerning themselves with where and how 
the  scripts are stored. The Application Scripting Framework needs to provide 
 a  set of services and interfaces which will allow these clients such access.
    <br>
 <br>
 <u>Requirements:</u>    <br>
 
<ul>
   <li>research current StarOffice script location/load/store interfaces</li>
   <li>define the digital signing service for scripts</li>
   <li>define the script location service</li>
   <li>define the script loading/storing service&nbsp;</li>

<h2>IDE related Issues      </h2>
 
<ul>
   <li>Do we want a scripting IDE as part of SO&nbsp; (I will call this internal 
 IDE for  simplicity) or an external one plugging into SO? One option could 
be to have an  internal IDE for StarBasic and an external IDE for the new 
scripting languages.  The external editor should be NetBeans (Forte for JAVA?). 
NetBeans already  has  some support for BeanShell, Dynamic Java and Jython. 
This support definitely  needs further improvements. If we go with NetBeans 
then we might need to  cooperate with NetBeans developers. NetBeans has a 
framework for plugging  in new  scripting interpreters into the IDE.&nbsp;</li>
   <li>The main issues are debugging and editing scripts, code browsing,
 configuration.</li>
   <li>We need possibilities to edit and debug scripts from simple command 
line  applications.&nbsp;</li>
 
</ul>
 <u>Code editing:</u><br>
 &nbsp;We need the script storage and script loading and storing interfaces 
as  described above. This needs to be able to retrieve and store a script 
source  and its context (document, application). Both the IDE (internal and 
external)  and the command line application need to use these interfaces to
edit scripts  and their contexts.    <br>
 NetBeans has an API that abstracts storage of files and file like objects. 
 This  could use the script loading and storing interfaces to edit scripts. 
Context  editing could be done with Nodes, the DataSystems API and the Explorer 
API,  but  this needs to be investigated.    <br>
 <u>Debugging:</u><br>
 Main issues are launching, setting breakpoints and evaluating variables.
   <br>
 The IDE has to be able to launch the language specific debugger/interpreter 
 and  load the binary/script source and its context in it, an interface has 
to  be  defined for this.      <br>
 OpenOffice already has an <a
 href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/script/XDebugging.html">interface</a> 
for setting/clearing breakpoints and evaluating  variables. This could be 
the interface the debugger/interpreter plug-in of a new language  will have 
to implement. An IDE will have to use this interface to implement  the  debugging 
tasks and implement a Watch and Output windows to display various  information.
    <br>
 (If we go with NetBeans) the JVM and NetBeans are already integrated and 
 they do  not use this interface so without a language agnostic framework 
most of the work  would be done. If we want a language agnostic framework 
we will have to add  extra implementation for languages not supported by NetBeans.
This would  be  different from the way the JVM is integrated.<br>
 If we go with one or more Java based scripting language(s) as part of our
  implementation then we need to investigate ways of translating script code 
 line  numbers to Java code line numbers and script variables to underlying 
Java  variables.    Command line debugging does not need much here, the user 
will have to launch  the  language specific debugger and configure it (to 
find the SO libraries). A  command line utility will need to be developed 
that will load the script  in the  debugger/interpreter and make it aware 
of the script context.    <br>
 <u>Code browsing:</u><br>
 This is not as important as the previous ones.    <br>
 We need an interface that would return object and method names from a script.
  This will need language specific implementations. The IDE will have to
use  this  to display and navigate through the code structure.    <br>
 There would be no command line functionality here.<br>
 <u>Configuration</u>:<br>
 This has already been described as "runtime-related user interfaces".  We
  need a way to provide similar functionality when debugging from the command
  line.      <br><br>

<h2>Macro Recording</h2>
 Macro recording is not a very big issue in the investigation phase. The
main   issue is whether we can generate macros made of UNO API calls or we
have  to stay  with the dispatch APIs. The investigation should be about
whether this is  possible or not and how to do it.    It is very simple to
write macro recorders for any language if the recorded  macros use the dispatch 
API. Considering that for UNO API based macro recording  we would probably 
have to write UNO API based macros for all the dispatch  calls  in all the 
languages that we support, UNO API based macro recording might  not be  feasible. 
But this should be the subject of the investigation.      <br>
 
<h2>Runtime related security</h2>
 <u>Problem domain definition:</u><br>
 The language runtime security subsystem is a set of restrictions  which
are applied by the language runtime to a script  during loading and execution.
  <br>
 Restrictions could be applied to:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>the type of the script</li>
   <li>the source of the script</li>
   <li>the length of life of the script</li>
   <li>the amount of resource available to the script</li>
   <li>the availability of a service by the type of the service</li>
   <li>the availability of the specific service by the type  of&nbsp;the
request</li>
   <li>the availability of the specific service by the content  of the request</li>
 
</ul>
 <u>Participants:</u><br>
 
<ul>
   <li>the script execution sandbox<br>
 an implementation of the language  neutral runtime security  &nbsp;subsystem</li>
   <li>the language runtime (the runtime container)&nbsp;<br>
  language specific binding to the execution engine (VM)</li>
   <li>the language execution context<br>
 static and runtime data available  to a script during execution</li>
   <li>the code management subsystem<br>
 script finder/explorer/loader</li>
   <li>UI of security configuration</li>
   <li>debugger&nbsp;</li>
 
</ul>
 
<h2>Script lifecycle services</h2>
 <u>Problem domain definition:</u><br>
 The script lifecycle services is a subsystem of the execution  engine (VM) 
which is responsible for:<br>
 
<ul>
   <li>creation and maintains of the script execution context</li>
   <li>control over the script length of life</li>
   <li>accounting of the script acquired resources</li>
   <li>clean up after the script end of life.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
 
</ul>
 <u>Participants:</u><br>
 
<ul>
   <li>the code management subsystem  <br>
 script finder/explorer/loader</li>
   <li>the language runtime (the runtime container)<br>
 language specific binding to the execution engine (VM)</li>
   <li>the language execution context  <br>
 static and runtime data available  to a script during  &nbsp;execution 
       </li>
 
</ul>

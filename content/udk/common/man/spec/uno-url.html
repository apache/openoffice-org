<h2> Specification </h2>
<p>
The UNO-Url is used to address a specific UNO object in a different process. It allows
services such as the
<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/bridge/UnoUrlResolver.html">
com.sun.star.bridge.UnoUrlResolver</a> to map the addressed object from a remote process
into the local process by setting  an interprocess connection and by using a certain
kind of protocol on this connection.
<p>

<p>

The UNO-Url consists of four parts separated by colon and semicolon.
<ol type=I>
<li> The constant string 'uno:'. This identifies the url as UNO-Url and is needed to distinguish
a uno-url e.g. from an http or ftp url.
</li>
<li> A string which characterizes the type of the connection, that shall be
used to access
the other process. Directly after this string can optionally follow a comma separated list
of name-value pairs, where name and value are separated by a '='.

<p>
The connection-type-string and the names may only consist of ASCII letters and digits. They
are not case sensitive. The value part is an arbitrary Unicode string, which is
encoded in UTF8. Any character except letters, digits and <code>!$&'()*+-./:?@_~</code>
must be converted to <code>%xx</code>, where xx is the hexadecimal representation of the UTF8
byte. There are functions defined (see <a href="../../../cpp/ref/names/rtl/c-Uri.html">Uri</a> class) which
support such conversions.

<p>

The <a href="connection_services.html">connection_services</a> document explains currently
supported connection types and parameters and how the connection types can be extended.
<p>
The connection-type specifies the transport mechanism used to transfer a bytestream (e.g.
tcp/ip-sockets or named pipes).
</li>

<li>
A string which characterizes the type of protocol that is used to communicate over the
established byte stream connection. The string can be followed by a comma separated list
of name-value pairs, which can be used to customize the protocol to specific needs. The
suggested protocol is urp (Uno Remote Protocol), have a look at the <a href="urp.html">
specification</a> to see how it works and to get a list of possible properties.

<p>
The protocol-type-string and the names may only consist of ASCII letters and digits. They
are interpreted case insensitive. The value part is an arbitrary Unicode string, which is
encoded in UTF8. Any character except letters, digits and <code>!$&'()*+-./:?@_~</code>
must be converted to <code>%xx</code>, where xx is the hexadecimal representation of the UTF8
byte. There are functions defined (see <a href="../../../cpp/ref/names/rtl/c-Uri.html">Uri</a> class),
which support such conversions.

<p>
The arrangement of connections and bridges is explained in detail in the
<a href="remotebridge.html">remotebridge</a> document.

<li>The object name of the object to be imported. A process
must explicitly export a certain object by this distinct name, it is not possible
to access an arbitrary UNO-object (for example as it would be possible in with CORBA's IOR).

<p>Valid characters are letters, digits, and <code>!$&'()*+,-./:?=@_~</code>. Other characters
are forbidden, such that this string can be taken as is (no conversion or escaping required).
</li>
</ol>

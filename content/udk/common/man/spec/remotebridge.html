			under development, while URP is final.
			After

			<H4>Bootstrapping the bridge</H4>
			<P><FONT SIZE=3><I>Fig. 1</I> shows all necessary services (and
			their exported interfaces ) to create and use an interprocess bridge</FONT>.
			An interprocess bridge can be instantiated via the service
			com.sun.star.bridge.BridgeFactory using the call
			XBridgeFactory.createBridge(). The caller needs to pass 4
			Arguments to the bridge factory.</P>
			<P>The first argument is the name of the bridge. When no name is
			given, an exclusive bridge is created, which means that the bridge
			cannot be retrieved via the getBridge() method. Giving the bridge
			a certain name allows another component to reuse the bridge via
			the getBridge() passing the same name. Unnamed bridges can be
			safely disposed without bothering other possible users, while named
			bridges can be reused.</P>
			<P>The second argument is the protocol string. Up to now,
			"iiop" and "urp" is supported.
			Internally, the bridgefactory
			searches for a service "com.sun.star.bridge.Bridge.protocolname "
			and creates it. You may provide parameters, following the protocolname and
			separated with comma(s), to the bridge (currently, there are no
			parameters supported).</P>
			<P>The third argument is a reference to an
			XConnection-interface. The XConnection interface offers simple
			read/write functions to exchange data with an arbitrary process.
			The UDK supplies two services to build up a connection between two
			processes (see acceptor/connector documentation), but one is
			welcome to use their own implementation. Note that the
			XConnection-interface does not have methods to initiate a
			connection, it expects to receive a fully functional connection.
			Note also, that the bridge expects to be the ONLY USER of the
			connection, it can't cope with any, in between, read/write calls.</P>
			<P>The createBridge()-caller may optionally pass an
			XInstanceProvider-implementation. When the first request from the
			remote process comes in, the bridge will call the
			XInstanceProvider.getInstance() method to resolve the
			first-object. At least one process must provide an
			XInstanceProvider-implementation ( in general the
			"server-process").</P>
			<P>The resulting object, which is only a wrapper around a
			C-Interface, exports an XBridge interface.
			</P>
			<P>The bridge has three methods, the getInstance() method is the
			most important one. It allows the "client-process" to
			retrieve the primary object from the remote process. The passed
			string may be used to distinguish between different primary
			objects. The bridge in the remote process will call
			XInstanceProvider.getInstance( ) to resolve the requested object.</P>
			<P>On client side, the bridge returns a proxy for the remote
			object. The uno-programmer cannot distinguish between a proxy
			object or an original object.</P>
			<P>The primary object supports, in general, an interface that
			allows for retrieving other objects (for instance
			XMultiServiceFactory, XNamingService, or etc.)</P>
			<P>The bridge also supports the XComponent interface. Calling
			dispose immediately cancels all ongoing remote calls. See below
			for further information.</P>
			<P>Note that "client" and "server" is here
			used only for convenience. In a distributed environment, one
			process may act as client and as server at the same time.</P>

			<H4> Lifetime of the bridge </H4>
			<P>The bridge remains active as long as there are proxies or stubs
			(which implicitly hold the bridge). When the last proxy dies, the
			bridge will dispose itself and close the connection.</P>
			<P>The bridge can be actively disposed by querying for the
			XComponent-interface and calling a dispose. This will initiate the
			shutdown procedure described below. The same procedure is done,
			when the connection is closed for any external reason.</P>
			<P>Hard shutdown procedure:</P>
			<P>The connection is closed immediately. All pending requests
			will receive a RuntimeException. After all threads have left the
			bridge, the bridge explicitly deletes all stubs, so that original
			objects held by the stubs are released. The bridge itself is
			deleted when the last proxy dies.</P>
			<P>Note that the main thread may need to synchronize with the
			other threads in order to safely shutdown an application. Waiting
			for a certain amount of time after disposing is a dirty but quick
			solution for the problem.
			</P>
			<P>Note that all components must be able to cope with a
			RuntimeException as a result of an arbitrary UNO-call to allow a
			safe shutdown.</P>

		<TD WIDTH=100%>
		When your Java or C++ extension for OpenOffice.org is too slow, this can often be solved by reducing
		redundant API calls. Each API call (Java-C++ inprocess, Java-C++ outofprocess,
		C++-C++ outofprocess) involves a bridging overhead, which is about one milli second per call.
		(Note that C++-C++ inprocess is not bridged at all and cannot be logged, but it is either way
		very fast !).

		<p>By using a specially built interprocess bridge, you can log the interprocess calls into a file,
		in order to analyze them later. I have prepared for Linux,Solaris and windows a shared library,
		which you simply should copy into the office-program directory (make sure, you have moved away
		the original one before). They can be downloaded from the
		<a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">files section</a>. They
		have been built in a OpenOffice.org 1.0 source tree, but should also work in later OpenOffice.org builds and
		in StarOffice builds.

		<p>
		In order to activate logging, you need to set the following environment variables :
		<table summary="Environment variables">
		<tr>
		<td> PROT_REMOTE_ACTIVATE</td>
		<td> 1 </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
		<td>PROT_REMOTE</td>
		<td>/system-path/to/logfile</td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		so e.g. on windows
		<pre>
		set PROT_REMOTE_ACTIVATE=1
		set PROT_REMOTE=c:\mylog
		</pre>

		After you have started the office out of this shell, for each newly established bridge a file is
		created, e.g. c:\mylog_pid1023_0 for an interprocess bridge and c:\mylog_pid1023_1 for the
		Java-C++ inprocess. Note, that this is only an example, in fact, the last number in the
		file name gives the order in which the bridges get used. E.g. when you connect from another
		process to the office, the _0 file will be this interprocess bridge. When you then instantiate
		a Java service in the office process, the _1 file will appear. In general, a quick look at the
		methods names in the files tells you, which bridge belongs to which file.

		<p>
		Each log file contains the time of calling in milliseconds (since an arbitrary point of time), the bytesize of
		each call, whether it was synchron or asynchron, and the name of the method, which has been called.

		e.g.
		<pre>
		015572: calling [size=128(usedata=3)] [synchron=1] [name=queryInterface]
		015743: getting reply [size=264(usedata=240)][name=queryInterface]
		015752: serving request [size=125(usedata=31)] [synchron=1] [name=queryInterface]
		015754: replying [size=93(usedata=59)] [name=queryInterface]
		</pre>
		The log is created in the C++ remote bridge. Therefor the output means e.g. for the Java-C++ inprocess
		bridge : 'calling' means a call is initiated from the C++-office to an Java object, 'getting reply'
		means that the call has returned from Java, 'serving request' means that from the Java side a call
		to a C++ object has been initiated and replying means that this call is now going back to Java.

		<p>
		Happy profiling :o).

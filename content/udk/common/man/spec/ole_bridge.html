<h2><a name="a1"> 1 Introduction </a></h2>

<P>The  OLE bridge is a means to allow UNO
objects to be accessed in a COM environment, that is to say a COM
client can calls an UNO server without having do deal with UNO
specific details. Conversely an UNO object can use COM objects and
does not have to know anything about COM.

<P>The bridge can be incorporated by
different languages as long as the languages support OLE. So far the
bridge has proved to work reliable with C++ and JScript. VBScript and
Visual Basic still needs some testing and as for all other eligible
languages they require testing from the ground up.
<P> As the name "OLE" bridge implies the bridge deals with OLE objects
  and not with COM objects generally. That means that only "dispatch objects"
  can be mapped to UNO and UNO objects are only mapped to dispatch objects.
</p>

<h2><a name="a2"> 2 Requirements </a></h2>

<p>
First of all the system must be able to
run both object models. As for COM, it runs on all Windows 95/98,
Windows 3.51, Windows 2000 and Windows ME operating systems. There
are also ports to Macintosh and Unix and since November 1999 there is
a reference implementation for UNIX developed by the Open Group. UNO
is available whenever the UDK is installed on a machine or indirectly
when an Office is installed. As for the latter, the setup needs to be
run to ensure that the initial UNO object is properly registered  at
the system's registry. Simply copying the executables and
libraries won't do.</p>

<p>The bridge depends on some additional services. These are</p>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">com.sun.star.script.Invocation,<br/>
com.sun.star.script.InvocationAdapterFactory,<br/>
com.sun.star.script.Converter<br/>
com.sun.star.reflection.CoreReflection,<br/>
com.sun.star.beans.Introspection.</P>

<h2><a name="a3"> 3 Parts of the Bridge </a></h2>

<p>
In contrast to other language bindings
the OLE bridge is based on services. The following paragraphs give an
overview of  the functionalities which are provided by them.
</P>

<h3>3.1 Service com.sun.star.bridge.OleBridgeSupplier2</h3>
<P>Implementation name: com.sun.star.comp.ole.OleConverter2</P>

<P>The service is able to bridge elements
of one environment to elements of another environment. This feature
is provided by exposing the interface
<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/bridge/XBridgeSupplier2.html">
com.sun.star.bridge.XBridgeSupplier2</a> which looks like
</p>
<pre>
module com {  module sun {  module star {  module bridge {

[ uik(5F97D2F0-50F8-11d4-83240050-04526AB4),
	ident(&quot;XBridgeSupplier2&quot;, 1.0 ) ]
interface XBridgeSupplier2: com::sun::star::uno::XInterface
{
    any createBridge( [in] any aModelDepObject,
	              [in] sequence&lt; byte &gt; aProcessId,
		      [in] short nSourceModelType,
		      [in] short nDestModelType )
	raises(	com::sun::star::lang::IllegalArgumentException );

}; }; }; };
</pre>


<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As the parameter nSourceModelType and
nDestModelType suggest this interface allows the bridging of element
of very different models. The constant group <a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/bridge/ModelDependent.html">
ModelDependent</a> specifies
the values which can be used with that interface.</P>

<pre>
module com {  module sun {  module star {  module bridge {
constants ModelDependent
{
    const short UNO = 1;
    const short OLE = 2;
    const short JAVA = 3;
    const short CORBA = 4;
};
}; }; }; };
</pre>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When using OleBridgeSupplier2 then only
the constants UNO and OLE will have effect. The parameter
aModelDepObject contains the element that is to be bridged and the
return value contains the bridged element.
</P>

<h3>3.2 Service: com.sun.star.bridge.OleBridgeSupplierVar1</h3>

<p>Implementation name:  com.sun.star.comp.ole.OleConverterVar1

<P>The name OleBridgeSupplierVar1 is
admittedly badly chosen and rather nondescript. Anyway, the "Var1"
indicates that the service is a variation of the OleBridgeSupplier
service. And in fact the functionality is the same but the way it is
achieved is partly different. OleConverterVar1 was developed to
optimize performance in a remote client server environment. A
scenario could look like this:</p>

<p>A remote UNO object object is to
be converted into an OLE object. Because the bridge can only handle
UNO objects which expose XInvocation it utilizes the
com.sun.star.script.Invocation service that creates an invocation
object out of every UNO object or struct. Invocation has to
introspect the respective object which is very expensive in terms of
function calls. Now consider Invocation to reside on the client and
the actual object on a remote server. Obviously there would be a
great many network round trips causing a negative performance impact.

<p>OleBridgeSupplier2 is just doing that and hence it is
inappropriate for this scenario. OleBridgeSupplierVar1 on the other
hand allows the remote creation of Invocation. Since Invocation and
the object now reside in the same process the process of creating
invocation objects is a lot more efficient.</P>

<P>Another issue concerns the way of how
the bridge realizes the IDispatch interface for UNO wrapper objects.
An UNO wrapper is an object that contains an UNO object and it
implements IDispatch so that the wrapper can be used in an OLE
environment. Calls on the wrapper's IDispatch are mapped to calls on
the XInvocation of the wrapped object.</p>

<p>OLE objects are used
through their IDispatch interface. A function call or accessing a
property is twofold. First IDispatch::GetIDsOfNames is called which
basicly takes the function or property name and returns an id
(DISPID). With the id at hand the IDispatch::Invoke can be called. The
Invoke implementation knows by way of the DISPID exactly what
function or property it has been called for.
</P>
<P>The OleBridgeSupplier2 UNO wrapper
checks in GetIDsOfNames whether the object exists or not before it
issues a DISPID. The caller knows immediately if the function or
property exists. This check is not carried out by
OleBridgeSupplierVar1 because it would cause at least one remote call
(remember the object is remote). DISPIDs are blindly passed out
whenever GetIDsOfNames is being called for a new name. If the DISPID
produces an error during the Invoke call then the name is cached, so
that the next time GetIDsOfNames is being called the caller receives
an appropriate error code.</P>

<P>The OleBridgeSupplierVar1 UNO wrapper has to do
  some more work in IDispatch::Invoke because it has not obtained any type information
  yet about the meaning of the current call. The wFlags parameter of IDispatch::Invoke
  can e.g. consist of a combination of DISPATCH_METHOD and DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUT.
  In this case the wrapper tries first to call a method on the wrapped UNO object
  and when this fails it tries to access a property. Moreover after a call to
  XInvocation failed the wrapper checks whether the name is correct by calling
  XExactName::getExactName that is provided by the invocation object. During the
  Invoke call information are gathered which are cached so that whenever the same
  call is made again the cached information are used to fasten up the process.</P>

<h3>3.3 com.sun.star.bridge.OleApplicationRegistration</h3>

<P>Implementation name: com.sun.star.comp.ole.OleServer</P>

<P>This service registers a COM class factory when the service is
being instantiated and deregisteres it when the service is being
destroyed. The class factory constructs an UNO multi service factory
within the OLE environment. Services created by this factory are
always created in that environment. That means that someone who is
using the COM class factory as starting point for an application
which incorporates UNO rarely has to deal with the OLE bridge
themselves.</p>

<p>The multi service factory which is mapped into the
COM environment is the same factory which is passed into the
component_getFactory function of the housing DLL.
</P>

<h3>3.4 com.sun.star.bridge.OleObjectFactory</h3>

<P>Implementation name: com.sun.star.comp.ole.OleClient</P>

<P>The OleObjectFactory represents itself as multi service factory by
exposing the XMultiServiceFactory interface. It is used to create COM
objects. The COM components are specified by their programmatic
identifier (ProgId). The COM objects are created in the UNO
environment, meaning they are wrapped by objects which implement
XInvocation and map calls to IDispatch.</P>

<P>To map an OLE object into the UNO environment you could create
the object through any COM mechanism (e.g. CoCreateInstance) and
then convert it by means of the service OleBridgeSupplier2. Actually
the OleObjectFactory does not do otherwise.</P>

<h2><a name="a4"> 4 Mapping of Types </a></h2>

<P>The bridge maps data from UNO to OLE automation types and vice
versa. Because the bridge can be used from different languages there
are also some language specific issues to be considered; e.g. JScript
has no out parameters. The problem is that the bridge cannot tell
what language makes use of it, since on the binary level the
communication between interfaces complies with the COM
specification, regardless of the language. For more information about
JScript and the issues involved see <a href=#a5>chapter 6</a>.</P>

<P>The table 1 summarizes the possible conversions from  OLE
Automation types to UNO types. (The names in italic letters are not
idl types)</P>

<ol>
<li>JScript does not use the types float, char and short. If the
target UNO function takes one of those types then an appropriate
conversion occurs.</li>

<li><p>The default behaviour of the conversion routine is that
dispatch objects are converted into invocation objects (objects
implementing XInvocation). The actual COM object is wrapped by an UNO
object that implements XInvocation. Calls on XInvocation are mapped
to calls on IDispatch.</p>
<p>If a dispatch object is actually a wrapped
UNO object then the original UNO object is extracted. Consider the
following JScript (COM environment) code:</p>

<Pre>
// obj is an uno object
var obj2= obj.getSomeObject();
//obj2 is an UNO object which is encapsulated by an UNO wrapper
obj.putSomeObject( obj2);
</Pre>

<p>
When obj2 is passed back into the UNO environment then "obj" receives
the original UNO object instead of a COM wrapper object.

<P>When an UNO object in a COM environment receives an dispatch
object in an IDispatch::Invoke call then it acquires type information
about the parameter. The information contains the type what the
dispatch object should represent in the UNO environment. If an
interface other than XInvocation is expected than that specific
interface is created by way of the service
com.sun.star.script.InvocationAdapterFactory.
</P>
<P>In JScript one uses Array objects for out or in/out parameters (see <a href="#a6">JScript issues
 </a>). Those objects are dispatch objects which are converted into the expected
  type. Besides, the Array objects are of course used for arrays. If so then
  they are converted into a Sequence with the proper element type.</P>
<P>A mapped COM object can only be successfully used through XInvocation if it
  provides type information through IDispatch::GetTypeInfo.</P>

<li>A SAFEARRAY is converted to sequence&lt;<I>type</I>&gt; where type is the
  respective UNO type. If the SAFEARRAY has more than one dimension then the anys
  contain sequences of sequences and so forth; e.g. sequence&lt;sequence&lt;long&gt;&gt;.</P>
<li>Whenever an UNO function requires an any parameter then the caller in the
  COM environment is not obliged to pass a VARIANT (actually VT_VARIANT | VT_BYREF).
<p>Instead the actual type can be put into the respective VARIANT argument (DISPPARAMS::rgvarg).</p>
  If the bridge receives an VT_DISPATCH then it depends of the type information
  of the target UNO function or property what the dispatch object will be converted
  into (see [2], <a href="#a6">JScript issues</a>).
</P>

<ol>
<li>A Sequence which has as element
type of a sequence could be regarded as two-dimensional array. The
difference is that the element sequences could have varying lengths
whereas the elements of a certain dimension of a  multidimensional
array have the same length. To reflect that, sequences are converted
into one-dimensional SAFEARRAYs with VARIANT elements which in turn
can contain SAFEARRAYs. This conversion works fine with COM objects
which expect those arrays, e.g. COM objects which implement UNO
interfaces (see <a href="#a10">chapter 10</a>). But quite often this will not
be the
case and if a function argument is a SAFEARRAY of a certain element
type and dimension then exactly this argument has to be provided.

<p>Whenever the bridge determines that a COM object does not
implement UNO interfaces then it converts a Sequence into a SAFEARRAY
as described by the type information provided through the object's
IDispatch interface.
</P>
<P>In case IDispatch::Invoke expects an
argument of type SAFEARRAY(VARIANT) then the UNO clients can provide
sequence&lt;any&gt; or just sequence&lt;<I>type</I>&gt;, where <I>type
</I>means the actual UNO type.</P>
<li>The XBridgeSupplier2::createInstance function returns an any that
contains the converted element. If the target environment is OLE than
the any contains an unsigned long that is actually a VARIANT*. The
VARIANT then contains the converted element  and has never the
VT_BYREF bit set. Hence it cannot contain another VARIANT.
</P>
<P>When a client uses the COM object in an
UNO environment (through XInvocation) and calls a function that
requires a VARIANT argument, then the bridge  creates the arguments
for IDispatch::Invoke as needed.  In this case DISPPARAMS::rgvarg
would contain a VARIANT with VARTYPE::vt= VT_VARIANT | VT_BYREF. To
do this the bridge must use type information which is provided
through IDispatch::Invoke.
</P>
</ol>

<h2><a name="a8"> 5 Using the bridge </a></h2>

<p>
The bridge is automatically used when someone access the
  Office through the COM mechanism. This is done by creating the service manager
  component, that has the ProgId <font face="Courier New, monospace">&quot;com.sun.star.ServiceManager&quot;.
  </font>The service manager can then be used to create additional UNO services.
  There is no explicit mapping from COM to UNO or vice versa necessary. All objects
  which have been obtained directly or indirectly from the service manager are
  already COM objects.
<p>The ServiceManager implements the <a
href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/lang/XMultiServiceFactory.html">
  XMultiServiceFactory</a> interface, that is used to create UNO services. Bear
  in mind though, that ServiceManager is a COM object and hence it is to be accessed
  through the IDispatch interface.</p>
<p>Example C++:</p>

<pre>
// create the service manager of OpenOffice
IDispatch* pdispFactory= NULL;
CLSID clsFactory= {0x82154420,0x0FBF,0x11d4,{0x83, 0x13,0x00,0x50,0x04,0x52,0x6A,0xB4}};
hr= CoCreateInstance( clsFactory, NULL, CLSCTX_ALL, __uuidof(IDispatch), (void**)&amp;pdispFactory);
// create the CoreReflection service
OLECHAR* funcName= L&quot;createInstance&quot;;
DISPID id;
pdispFactory-&gt;GetIDsOfNames( IID_NULL, &amp;funcName, 1, LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT, &amp;id);

VARIANT param1;
VariantInit( &amp;param1);
param1.vt= VT_BSTR;
param1.bstrVal=   SysAllocString( L&quot;com.sun.star.reflection.CoreReflection&quot;);
DISPPARAMS dispparams= { &amp;param1, 0, 1, 0}; VARIANT result;
VariantInit( &amp;result);
hr= pdispFactory-&gt;Invoke( id, IID_NULL, LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT, DISPATCH_METHOD,
			  &amp;dispparams, &amp;result, NULL, 0);
IDispatch* pdispCoreReflection= result.pdispVal;
pdispCoreReflection-&gt;AddRef();
// do something with the CoreReflection service
</pre>

<p> Example JScript:</p>

<pre>
var factory= new ActiveAObject("com.sun.star.ServiceManager");
var coreReflection= factory.createInstance("com.sun.star.reflection.CoreReflection");
// do something with the CoreReflection service
</pre>

<p>Irrespective of the Office you can map every COM
  or UNO elements directly by using the com.sun.star.bridge.OleBridgeSupplier2
  service. The code to convert an UNO service could look like this:</p>

<pre>
// convert the service xIntServiceX to a dispatch object
Any any;
IDispatch* pdisp= NULL;
any &lt;&lt;= xIntServiceX;
sal_uInt8 arId[16];
rtl_getGlobalProcessId( arId);
Any target= xSuppl-&gt;createBridge( any, Sequence&lt;sal_Int8&gt;( (sal_Int8*)arId, 16), UNO, OLE);
if (target.getValueTypeClass() == TypeClass_UNSIGNED_LONG) 
{
    VARIANT* pVariant = *(VARIANT**)target.getValue();
    pdisp= pVariant-&gt;pdispVal;
    pdisp-&gt;AddRef()
    VariantClear(pVariant);
    CoTaskMemFree(pVariant);
}

// do something with pdisp (IDispatch*)
</pre>

<p> COM objects can be converted as long as they support IDispatch:

<pre>
// create the COM object
hr= CoCreateInstance( COMPONENTS_CLSID, NULL,CLSCTX_ALL,
		      IID_Unknown, (void**) &amp;punk);

// create the service factory
Reference&lt;XInterface&gt;
xint= createRegistryServiceFactory( OUString(L&quot;applicat.rdb&quot;));
Reference&lt;XMultiServiceFactory&gt; factory=
	Reference&lt;XMultiServiceFactory&gt;( xint, UNO_QUERY);

// create the bridge service
Reference&lt; XInterface &gt; xIntSupplier= mgr-&gt;createInstance(
				OUString(L&quot;com.sun.star.bridge.OleBridgeSupplier2&quot;));
Reference&lt; XBridgeSupplier2 &gt; xSuppl( xIntSupplier, UNO_QUERY);

Any any;
Variant var;
VariantInit( &amp;var);
var.vt= VT_UNKNOWN;
var.punkVal= punk;
any &lt;&lt;= ( sal_uInt32)&amp;var;
sal_uInt8 arId[16];
rtl_getGlobalProcessId( arId);
Any target= xSuppl-&gt;createBridge( any, Sequence&lt;sal_Int8&gt;(
				 (sal_Int8*)arId, 16), OLE, UNO );
Reference&lt;XInvocation&gt; theObject;
target&gt;&gt;= theObject;

// theObject contains now the mapped COM object
</pre>

<p>Apart from objects one can map all the data types
  as shown in table 1 and table 2.</p>

<p>A "specialization" of the OleBridgeSupplier2
  service is the OleObjectFactory service. It does basically what the above source
  sample does; just mapping a COM object to XInvocation.</p>

<h2><a name="a5"> 6 Creation of types </a></h2>

<P>The creation of types of one environment within the same environment
  is not an issue but it looks different if this is done in another environment.
  Usually it is not necessary at all because types of one environment are automatically
  mapped to types of the other environment. In other words, one creates a value
  of a type which is native to the current environment and passes it to an object
  function, where the object stems from the other environment. The bridge automatically
  converts the type if necessary. This even works for UNO interfaces on COM side
  (see <a href="#a10">chapter 10</a>). But it is a different matter with UNO structs. When a struct
  is mapped from UNO to COM then it is encapsulated by an dispatch object and
  when this object is passed back to UNO then the original struct is extracted.
  If an UNO object function takes a struct as argument, then it it not possible
  to create a dispatch object and pass it as the respective argument. This functionality
  has not been implemented yet. Instead there are two ways of creating structs
  in the COM environment. First one can make use of the com.sun.star.CoreReflection
  service:</P>

<pre>
// create the service manager of OpenOffice
IDispatch* pdispFactory= NULL;
CLSID clsFactory= {0x82154420,0x0FBF,0x11d4,{0x83, 0x13,0x00,0x50,0x04,0x52,0x6A,0xB4}};
hr= CoCreateInstance( clsFactory, NULL, CLSCTX_ALL, __uuidof(IDispatch), (void**)&amp;pdispFactory);

// create the CoreReflection service
OLECHAR* funcName= L&quot;createInstance&quot;;
DISPID id;

<h2><a name="a6"> 7 JScript issues </a></h2>

<P>
JScript does not offer
arrays in a way as C or C++ do. Instead it provides the Array object
which acts as array but is actually a dispatch object. Therefore an
UNO object in the COM environment receives an dispatch object when it
is used in JScript and an Array object has been passed into a
function of that object.
</p>

<pre>
// JScript
var param= new Array(1,2,3);
// object is an UNO object
object.function( param);
</pre>

<P>JScript does not has out or in/out parameter. To create those
parameters we use Array objects. The value on index 0 (actually
property "0") contains the out- value after return of the
function.
</p>

<pre>
var out= new Array();
object.functionOut(out);
var value= out[0];
</pre>

<P>If an in/out parameter is needed then the in-value is set at index[0].</P>

<pre>
var inout= new Array();
inout[0]=123;
object.functionInOut( inout);
var value= inout[0];
</pre>

<P>Whenever the bridge has to convert a dispatch object
  then it first has to find out what the object actually represents (object,
  array, out parameter, in/out parameter) to do an appropriate conversion. This
  is done by acquiring type information, which itself is not problematic but in
  a remote environment it causes additional network traffic.To avoid this one
  could use Value Objects (see <a href="#a6">chapter 7</a>). Such an object can be used in place
  of every other parameter in a COM environment. The script programmer sets the
  type and value of this object, so that the bridge implementation knows what
  the value actually stands for. </P>

<P>JScript always uses doubles whenever it
encounters floating point values. When a UNO function is called which
actually takes a float as parameter, then the bridge does a
conversion by using the Windows function VariantChangeType. This
could cause a change of the value depending on the format of the
number used in the script.</p>

<p>When a UNO function returns a float or
has a float as out-parameter then the conversion is put off to
JScript. The results of this conversion most certainly does not match
the expected value. In a test a UNO function has been called with the
number1.234567 where the function expected a float. The function then
returned that value as float. JScript receives in this case a  value
of 1.2345670461654663.</P>

<P>A similar situation exist with integer values. JScript
  exclusively uses 32 bit integer values. The bridge tries to convert to a smaller
  type if necessary. This works fine as long as the numbers used in JScript correspond
  to the value range of the parameter type of the respective UNO function argument.</P>

<h2><a name="a7"> 8 Value Objects </a></h2>

<h3>8.1 Motivation</h3>

<P>An UNO object used in JavaScript is wrapped by an object that is COM compatible
  in that it exposes <CODE>IDispatch</CODE>. Such wrapper may be referred to as
  uno wrapper in this document. Every access on a uno wrapper within Java Script
  causes ultimately a call to <CODE>IDispatch::GetIDsOfNames </CODE>and on success
  <CODE>IDispatch::Invoke</CODE> is called. The parameters are passed as <CODE>VARIANT</CODE>
  s and are converted into <CODE>Any</CODE> s and a <CODE>Sequence</CODE>, in
  and in/out parameter are treated much differently in the process. The problem
  now is how to recognise the kind of the parameter because they are all represented
  by <CODE>IDispatch</CODE> objects (<CODE>VT_DISPATCH</CODE>). To solve this
  problem every time an <CODE>IDispatch</CODE> is to be converted it is checked
  what kind of parameter this parameter is expected to be and the conversion goes
  accordingly. For this it is necessary to acquire type information that is usually
  provided by the office application. In a remote scenario several network round trips
  would be required to deliver those information to the client. To prevent a severe
  performance impact it is desirable to dispense with type information. "ValueObjects"
  are a means to come close to that requirement.</P>

<h3>8.2 The Value Object</h3>
<P>A ValueObject is an object that acts as a value of a certain type and can be
  passed to UNO functions instead of the actual parameter. A ValueObject is passed
  to the wrapper as <CODE>IDispatch</CODE>. The uno wrapper queries every <CODE>IDispatch</CODE>
  parameter for the <CODE>IJScriptValueObject</CODE> interface and if that interface
  is being returned than the wrapper has a means to find out the exact type by
  using that interface and is not dependent on type information provided by the
  office application. ValueObjects and other parameters can be used interchangeably.</p>
<h3>8.3 Creation</h3>
<P>Every UNO object used by JavaScript is capable of delivering
ValueObjects. To obtain one imply call _GetValueObject:</P>

<Pre>
// object is some uno wrapper object
var valueObject= object._GetValueObject();
</pre>

<h3>8.4 The Interface of the Value Object</h3>
<P>A Value Object is actually an instance of class <CODE>JScriptValue</CODE> that
  implements <CODE>IDispatch</CODE> and <CODE>IJScriptValueObject</CODE>. The
  <CODE>IJScriptValueObject</CODE> looks like:</P>

<pre>
MIDL_INTERFACE(&quot;e40a2331-3bc1-11d4-8321-005004526ab4&quot;)
IJScriptValueObject: public IUnknown
{
    STDMETHOD( Set)( VARIANT type,  VARIANT value)= 0;
    STDMETHOD( Get)( /*out*/ VARIANT *val)= 0;
    STDMETHOD( InitOutParam)()= 0;
    STDMETHOD( InitInOutParam)( VARIANT type, VARIANT value)= 0;
    STDMETHOD( IsOutParam)( /*out*/ VARIANT_BOOL* flag)= 0;
    STDMETHOD( IsInOutParam)( /*out*/VARIANT_BOOL * flag)= 0;
    STDMETHOD( GetValue)( /*out*/ BSTR* type,/*out*/ VARIANT *value)= 0;
};
</pre>

<P><code>IJScriptValueObject::Set</code>: Sets
a value and specifies its type. The param "<CODE>type</CODE>"
specifies the type by a string and the parameter "<CODE>value</CODE>"
contains the value. Usable in JavaScript.</P>
<P><code>IJScriptValueObject::Get: </code>Delivers
the value that is contained in the ValueObject. Usable in JavaScript.</P>
<P><code>IJScriptValueObject::InitOutParam: </code>Stipulates
the ValueObject to represent an out parameter. Usable in JavaScript.</P>

<P><code>IJScriptValueObject::InitInOutParam:
</code>Stipulates the ValueObject to
represent an in/out parameter. Usable in JavaScript.</P>
<P><code>IJScriptValueObject::IsOutParam:
</code>Returns a boolean (as out
parameter)indicating whether the ValueObject acts as out parameter or
not. A return value of true means the object is an out parameter. Not
for use in JavaScript.</P>
<P><code>IJScriptValueObject::IsInOutParam: </code>Returns a boolean
(as out parameter) indicating whether the ValueObject acts as
in/out parameter or not. A return value of true means the objects is
an in/out parameter. Not for use in JavaScript.</P>
<p><code>IJScriptVal</code>v<code>ueObject::GetValue: </code> Returns the type
and value of the ValueObject as out parameter. Not for use in JavaScript. As
seen in the above function descriptions only <CODE>Get</CODE>,
<CODE>Set</CODE>, <CODE>InitInOutParam</CODE>
and <CODE>InitOutParam</CODE> can be used in JavaScript. To be more exact these
functions are exposed by <CODE>IDispatch</CODE>.

<h3>8.5 Supported Types</h3>

<P>When setting the ValueObject to a value the type is determined by
a string that is passed as first parameter in the Set function. The
table below shows what strings are currently accepted (column name).</P>

<h2><a name="a9"> 9 Limitations of the dispatch objects </a></h2>

<P>
The dispatch objects provided by the bridge do not support type
information. IDispatch::GetTypeInfoCount and IDispatch::GetTypeInfo
return  E_NOTIMPL. Moreover there are no COM type libraries available
and the dispatch objects do not implement IProvideClassInfo as well.
<P>
IDispatch::GetIDsOfName has to be called for every name separately.
That this one cannot query the ids for several names at a time.
<P>
IDispatch::Invoke does not support named arguments nor the
<I>pExcepInfo and puArgErr  </I>parameter.</P>

<h2><a name="a10"> 10 Implementing COM objects with UNO interfaces </a></h2>

<h3>10.1 Intention</h3>
<P>It is desirable to be able to build COM components which implement
UNO interfaces. Those components could be employed as listeners (COM:
event sinks), for numerous broadcasters (COM: event source).</P>

<h3>10.2 Terms and Conventions</h3>
<P>When speaking of implementing UNO interfaces in COM components, we
do not imply  the use of interfaces in terms of abstract C++ classes.
Instead the components have  to implement IDispatch and dispatch
method calls to functions that have the same names as the respective
UNO interface functions.</P>
<P>Basically all interfaces can be implemented as long as the data
type used in the UNO interfaces can be mapped to OLE automation
types. The mappings are shown in Table 3. One exception is the
XInvocation interface. Because it is itself a scripting interface, it
does not make sense to employ it within a COM component. Assuming
that someone wants to build a COM component that represents some UNO
XInvocation implementation then the properties and functions are to
be directly implemented. That is, IDispatch::Invoke dispatches
directly to those properties and methods.</P>
<P>XInterface does not need to be implemented.</P>
<P>Because the <CODE>queryInterface</CODE> mechanism
  does not work for COM components with implemented UNO interface, they have to
  supply a means to proclaim those interfaces. This is achieved by the property
  &quot;<CODE>_implementedInterfaces</CODE>&quot; that holds an array of strings
  which contain the fully qualified interface names. The property is not needed
  when only one interface is supported.</p>

<h3>10.3 Components in C++</h3>

<P>To build a component with C++ one can write the component from
scratch or use some kind of framework, where Microsoft's ATL comes
in handy. 
<p>A basic rule with implementing <CODE>IDispatch</CODE>
is that all parameters (meaning the actual arguments to the function
that is called in turn) are converted into the types that the
component expects. Although the OLE Bridge does not just pass
arguments with the type VT_VARIANT |VT_BYREF but instead the actual
type (see mapping table) it is still good practice to convert
parameters within the IDispatch::Invoke implementation.
</P>
<P>When using ATL there is no need to bother about this as long as
one uses a dual interface. Then the parameters correspond to the
types as shown in table ...</p>
<p>A COM component is free to support as
many UNO interfaces as it needs to but an ATL component just needs to
implement one dual interface. All UNO interface functions have to be
put in that dual. In fact there is no other way because ATL can only
expose one <CODE>IDispatch</CODE>.</P>

<P>Whenever out or in/out parameter are used then the VARTYPEs above are or'd
  with VT_BYREF.</P>
<P>E.g. there is an UNO interface with this idl description:
</p>

<pre>
interface XSimple : public com.sun.star.uno.XInterface
{
    void func1( [in] long val, [out] long outVal);
    void func2( [in] sequence&lt; long &gt; val, [out] sequence&lt; long &gt; outVal);
};
</pre>

<P>The MS IDL description (for an ATL
component with a dual interface) would look like:
</p>

<pre>
[
    object,
    uuid(xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx),
    dual,
    helpstring(&quot;ISimple Interface&quot;),
    pointer_default(unique)

interface ISimple : IDispatch

		HRESULT func1( [in] long val, [out] long* outVal);
    [id(2), helpstring(&quot;method func2&quot;)]
		HRESULT func2([in] SAFEARRAY(VARIANT) val,
			[out] SAFEARRAY(VARIANT) * outVal);
};
</pre>

<p>
The property  looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
[propget, id(4), helpstring(&quot;property_implementedInterfaces&quot;)]
	HRESULT	_implementedInterfaces([out, retval] SAFEARRAY(BSTR) *pVal);
</pre>

<h3>10.4 Components in JScript</h3>

<P>In JScript one does not have to deal with types. Nevertheless it
is important to know   how arrays, in/out and out parameter are used
because the usage is rather different.
</P>
<P>For in/out and out parameter an object with a property   &quot;0&quot;
is passed.

<pre>
function inoutFunction( val )
{
    var value= val[0];
    val[0]= 123;
}

function outFunction( val)
{
    val[0]= 123;
}
</pre>

<p>An Array is passed as out parameter:</p>

<pre>
function outArray( val )
{
    val[0]= new Array( 1,2,3);
}
</pre>

<p>If a JScript object should implement several interfaces than the
object has to have the property &quot;_<CODE>implementedInterfaces</CODE>&quot;.
Additionally a JScript has to support the property &quot;_environment&quot;
which must have the value &quot;JScript&quot;.
</p>

<pre>
function AnObject()
{
    this._environment= &quot;JScript&quot;;
    this._implementedInterfaces= new Array( &quot;XSimple1&quot;,
				&quot;XSimple2&quot;,&quot;XSimple3&quot;);

// the interface functions
this.simple1Func= simple1Func;
this.simple2Func= simple2Func;
this.simple3Func= simple3Func;
}
// XSimple1
function simpleFunc()
{
	...
}
// XSimple2
function simple2Func()
{
	...
}
// XSimple3
function simple3Func()
{

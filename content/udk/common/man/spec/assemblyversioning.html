<H1>Important Change</H1>
Because of the problem mentioned in Microsoft's knowledge base article 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905238/en-us">905238 </a>
we will increase the assembly versions for every new major and minor 
version of OOo. 

<H1>Notes</H1>
<p>For OOo 2.4.1 the version for policy.1.0.cli_basetypes.dll was changed from 
9.0.0.0 to 9.1.0.0. This was done because a bug, possibly in .NET Framwork 1.1,
caused the test program (cli_ure/qa/versioning) to fail, when the version
was 10.0.0.0. or greater (11.0.0.0 etc.).
It failed, however, only when StarOffice was updated. A
stand-alone installation always worked. 
</p>
<p>
The tests also failed with many updated respin versions of StarOffice. In all cases
.NET failed to find the latest policy assembly. For example, when version 6 and 13 of 
policy.1.0.cli_ure.dll where installed, then the framwork chose the older version.
Here is an overview of the tests. Tested where different respin version with an update 11:
</p>
<pre>
StarOffice     Test 
version	       result
(respin)       update u11
----------------------------
final           ok
u1 		ok
u2              failed 
u3              failed
u4              failed
u5              failed
u6              failed
u7              failed
u8              ok
u9              ok
u10             ok		
</pre>
<p>
It is possible that those respin versions which failed the test will also not 
work with older updates. For example, I tested a StarOffice u4 with the updates
8,9 and 10. The tests failed with all three offices.
</p>
<p>
When the runtests.exe was configured
to use the .NET Framework 2.0 then it worked with all updated offices.
To configure runtests to use another runtime one has to provide config file
(runtests.exe.config), which contains for example:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
 &lt;startup&gt;
   &lt;supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727" /&gt;
 &lt;/startup&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that the configuration file is only necessary if .NET Framework 1.1 AND
.NET Framework 2.0 are installed. The easiest way to enforce the use of the latest
framework is to simple uninstall .NET Framework 1.1.
</p>
<p>
As of StarOffice 9 (OOo 3.0) this problem will not exist anymore, since that office
requires at least a .NET Framework 2.0.
</p>

<H1>Versioning for assemblies of CLI-UNO Binding</H1>
<P>This documents gives some background
about the versioning applied to the assemblies which are part of the
CLI-UNO binding. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblies have all a strong names.
Hence the .NET runtime will strictly enforce versioning rules. That
is, a client application can only run with the assemblies it was
build with. The exception is, that users could change the application
or machine config file and redirect the version of the respective
assembly, or OOo installs policy assemblies.</P>

<P>
For this document we assume that the
reader has good knowledge of shared assemblies and policy assemblies.</P>

<H1>Versioning Scheme</H1>
<P>The version of an assembly consists of
four parts:</P>
<P>major.minor.build.revision</P>

<P>The meaning of every part can be freely
interpreted by developers. There is no need to use the parts exactly
as their names indicate.</P>
<P>For our assemblies we will use this
convention:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>major:  expresses a major change</LI>
	<LI>minor: expresses a minor incompatible change</LI>
	<LI>build: expresses a compatible change.</LI>
	<LI>revision: expresses a compatible change.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For incompatible changes we will
increase the major part of the assembly.  The minor will remain
unchanged, except for some urgent reasons. 
</P>
<P>The CLI-UNO assemblies should not
become incompatible very often. In fact, we will try to keep them
compatible as long as possible, so as not to break existing
application. 
</P>
<P>Usually we will increase the &ldquo;build&rdquo;
as a result of bug fixes or new compatible features. 
</P>
<P>The &ldquo;revision&rdquo; will remain
unchanged, except for some urgent reasons. 
</P>
<P>Although a version could change everytime an assembly was modified,
we will try to change the version only once between two official releases.
For example, say OOo2.0 will be shipped based on 680m130. In m131 a bug
will be fixed (compatibly). Then the version will be increased. Even
if other bugs will be fixed (compatibly) in the following milestones,
the version will remain unchanged. In the next official release, the
version will be the one from m131. If, however, the assembly will be
altered incompatibly, then the version must be increased again. But
the following compatible or incompatible changes, will not affect the
version of the forthcoming release. For example, in m132 an
incompatibility will be introduced and the version will be increased
again (major or minor). The next release will be based on m140. All
other changes between 132 and 140 will not cause the version to
change.</P>

<strong>Developers, please notice that you should build your CLI client applications 
always with the final version, such as OOo2, OOo3, etc. If, for an example, the application 
was build with assemblies from OOo2.0.1, then users with OOo2 cannot use it.</strong>


<H1>Compatible Changes and Policy Assemblies</H1>
<P>Compatible changes are often caused by
bug fixes. Because of the versioning rules of .NET (application runs
only with the assembly it has been build with), client applications
cannot benefit from the bug fixes without manual adaptations by the
user.  Because many users do not have the necessary knowledge,
OpenOffice.org will provide publisher policy assemblies.  By
installing the policy assemblies we will ensure, that applications
use the latest (compatible) assemblies of the CLI-UNO binding.</P>

<P>A policy assembly applies only for a
particular assembly with a determined major and minor version. For
example, policy.1.1.cli_types.dll  only applies for version 1.1.x.x
of cli_types.dll. This has some implications because the .NET
framework does not support a chaining mechanism for policy
assemblies. For example, let us assume there is a cli_types.dll with
these versions:</P>
<P>1.1 <br>
1.2<br>
1.3<br>

<P>Because the newer versions are
backwards compatible one could deploy these policy assemblies:<br>
policy.1.1.cli_types.dll:   
oldVersion: 1.1.0.0   newVersion: 1.2.0.0<br>
policy.1.2.cli_types.dll:   
oldVersion: 1.2.0.0   newVersion: 1.3.0.0</P>
</P>
<P>One could expect that an application
that was build with version 1.1 of cli_types.dll uses version 1.3.
But this is not the case. The application uses version 1.2. The
version part in the name of the policy assembly corresponds to the
macro.minor part of the assembly for which it provides the
redirection. If one wanted applications, which were build with v1.1
to use v1.3, then one would have to provide  a new policy assembly:</P>

<P>policy.1.1.cli_types.dll:   
oldVersion: 1.1.0.0   newVersion: 1.3.0.0</P>

<P>If we would allow that the minor part
of the version could be used to indicate a compatible change,  then
one would have to provide a policy assembly for every minor. For
example, let us again assume that the following versions of
cli_types.dll are compatible (they are backwards compatible to the
previous version):</P>
<P>1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4</P>
<P>And we assume that there are
applications, which have been build with one of these versions. In
order to have them all use the latest version 1.4, one would have to
ship three policy assemblies:</P>
<P>policy.1.1.cli_types.dll:   
oldVersion: 1.1.0.0   newVersion: 1.4.0.0<br>
policy.1.2.cli_types.dll:   
oldVersion: 1.2.0.0   newVersion: 1.4.0.0<br>
policy.1.3.cli_types.dll:   
oldVersion: 1.3.0.0   newVersion: 1.4.0.0<br>

<P>And this would have to be done for all
assemblies of CLI-UNO binding. Therefore, only the build and revision
part of the version are used for compatible changes. Then it is
sufficient to ship only one policy assembly for each assembly. Policy
assemblies have also a version. If there are several policy
assemblies installed, which all target the same assembly, then the
.NET runtime uses the policy with the latest version.</P>


<H2>Compatible Changes in cli_types.dll </H2>
Changes to unpublished types (declared in unoidl WITHOUT the keyword &quot;published&quot;) 
are always regarded as compatible changes even 
if they have been changed incompatibly. This is possible because client programs
must not use unpublished types. It is also necessary because changes to unpublished 
types may occur in every new version or product update. To declare the change
to be incompatible would prevent client code to run with the respective version of the 
office.


<H1>Versioning of Policy Assemblies</H1>
<P>Policy assemblies must have a version the same as ordinary
assemblies. By providing a version one can have different policy
assemblies for one assembly. The .NET runtime will use the policy
assembly with the latest version.</P>
<P>Policy assemblies are only used if there is a new version of an
assembly which is still backwards compatible. With our versioning
scheme this would apply to assemblies of the same name where the
major and minor part of the version are equal. For example, if there
are multiple versions of cli_types.dll: 1.1.0.0, 1.1.1.0, 1.1.2.0,
then there could be a policy.1.1.cli_types.dll 
<br>
version 1.0.0.0, redirecting from 1.1.0.0 to 1.1.1.0<br>
version 2.0.0.0, redirecting from 1.1.0.0-1.1.1.0 to 1.1.2.0<br>
</P>

<P>We will simply increase the major part unless there are urgent
reasons to use the other parts of the version. Please notice that the
name of the policy assembly already contains the major.minor version
parts of the related assembly.</P>

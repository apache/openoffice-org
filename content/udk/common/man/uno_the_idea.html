<h2><a name="Introduction"></a> Introduction </h2>

<p>Before explaining the concepts behind UNO, some
			problems that occurred in a C++ based, openoffice.org development
			effort, need to be presented.</P>

<ol>
<LI>There are a number of base projects (Tools, Streams, Visual Class Library,
				Framework, etc.) The higher projects, such as the word processor, calc, etc., use the
				classes of these base projects. After a change of some of these classes, 
				for example, a new member or virtual method is added, the entire office suite
				needs to be rebuilt. This takes two days, if no problems occur.

<LI>The API of the base project, with a few exceptions, is not well documented.
The base projects grow with the requirements of the higher projects.

<LI>The projects dependencies are complicated and difficult to understand.
Before making changes to an API we need to know, exactly, which projects are
affected.

<LI>StarOffice has a complex build environment.
	This made it very difficult for third parties to write components
	which could be integrated into the office suite.

<LI>StarOffice components could not be used outside of StarOffice.

<LI>There was a requirement to integrate components from other object models
like CORBA, COM/DCOM, or Java into StarOffice.  In addition, it was desirable
to have StarOffice components be first class components in other component
models.
			</OL>

<h2><a name="General_solution"></a> General solution </h2>

<P>There is a general approach to solve the above
			problems; therefore, the question of &ldquo;why should we use UNO&rdquo;, will
			be answered in this section.</P>

<ol>

<LI>There is a mechanism which enables a new method to be added to
				an existing class: this is done with interface technology. Only
				interfaces are exposed to other projects. To add a new method, you
				only have to add a new interface. So, new methods can be added to an
				existing old class, and then the other projects can use these new
				features. There is a migration path to the new API.

<LI>Use of an IDL-language to describe our interfaces
				and the functionality of components. To do this on an abstract
				level, normally, the documentation is better and the API is not
				implementation dependent.

<LI>To reduce the build dependencies of a specific
				component only interfaces are used to communicate with other
				components and the base libraries. In this case, the dependencies
				are flat.

<LI>Provide infrastructure to add components to a existing product or to the
system.

<LI>Reduce the dependencies of components, if possible.

<LI>To communicate between different component models we have to create a
bridge from UNO to the other component model.

</OL>
			<P>Here is why we are not using an existing component model: First,
			we cannot use Java Beans because it is not abstract, it is only
			usable in Java itself. Second, CORBA wouldn't be the right choice
			because there exists no specification for binary compatibility in
			one process and the communication between two components must be
			handled through the IIOP protocol. Third, COM/DCOM does not support
			exception handling, which is necessary to integrate smoothly into
			languages with native exception handling, such as C++, Java, etc.</P>

<h2><a name="The_Idea"></a> The Idea </h2>

			<P>First, we need to distinguish the difference between the
			Universal Component Environment (UCE) and UNO. UCE defines an
			environment in which components can be embedded and defines the
			API which must be supported by a component. The points 5 and 6, above, are
			solved with this technology. So, the UCE is on top of UNO. The
			construction of the UCE is documented in <A HREF="empty.html">uce.html.</A></P>

			<H4>The ideas of UNO are as follows:</H4>

			<OL>
				<LI>A binary specification of the memory layout of the IDL
				types. This specification is machine dependent, so it can be
				implemented directly, in many languages.

				<LI>Each object lives in an environment. Objects share this
				environment with other objects, which are compatible. This means
				the same compiler version, the same java virtual machine or something
				else. <!-- rh: The preceding sentence is not clear --> The only access to an object from another environment is to
				generate a proxy in your own environment. This can be
				accomplished by a bridge.

				<LI>To reduce the number of bridges, we define one environment
				called the Binary UNO Environment. It is recommended to provide a
				bridge to this environment. If you want to access an object, normally,
				you have two bridges. The first, from your environment to the
				Binary UNO Environment, and the second, from the Binary UNO
				Environment to the destination environment. For every new
				environment it is only necessary to implement one bridge.<br/>
				You
				can implement bridges between any two environments, but do this
				only for performance reasons.

				<LI>Provide a UNO runtime library which organizes access to
				the bridges and the environments. With the UNO runtime library, it is
				simple to access an object from another environment, presuming 
				that the bridges are installed.

				<LI>The important concept is, that all calls to an object in
				the Binary UNO Environment are dispatched through one function.
				This is the Dynamic Dispatch Function. All calls contain a full
				description of the method, which means: method name, argument
				types, return type, exceptions, and additional information.<br/>
				It
				is very simple to create a bridge to an interpreter, remote, or an
				environment which has a well specified API to call object methods,
				for example, Java.
			</OL>

<h2> How does this ideas solve the problems? </h2>

			<P>I explain the special solution with UNO and use the stated 
			points from the general solution.</P>
			<OL>
				<LI>UNO has one base interface called
				<A HREF="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/uno/XInterface.html"><I>com.sun.star.uno.XInterface</I></A>.
				This interface provides a method called <I>queryInterface</I>.
				With this method you can get other interfaces. In this way, it is
				possible to extend an existing class. In UNO terminology, we speak
				of components instead of classes. Look into the document
				<A HREF="../empty.html">xinterface.html</A> for detailed
				information about <I>com.sun.star.uno.XInterface.</I>

<LI>An UNO IDL compiler is provided. The language is similar
				to CORBA's IDL. An extension of our language was a special tag
				called <I>service</I>. In a service, you can specify the
				interfaces, properties, and the interaction between the interfaces
				of a component.

				<LI>We implement components in UNO only with dependencies to
				interfaces, or to our base libraries, VOS, SAL, and OSL. We generate
				the declaration files in the project of the component itself; so
				there are only dependencies to the base libraries, the binary
				type repository, and the tool that generates the declarations.

				<LI>The Universal Component Environment provides an API to get
				the dependencies from a component. This solution is documented
				in the <A HREF="empty.html">UCE</A> document.

				<LI><p>The other solutions are nice to have, but this is the
				fundamental solution done in UNO. First, the <A HREF="../reference/Cppu/index.html">UNO
				runtime library</A> provides access to the environment in which
				the component is written (e.g., <I>uno_getEnvironment(..., &ldquo;msci&rdquo;,
				0 )</I>). A component <B>need not </B>know it's environment until
				it is accessed from another environment. Next, the UNO runtime
				library provides access to the <A HREF="bridge.html">bridge</A>
				between two environments (e.g., <I>uno_getMapping(..., &ldquo;msci&rdquo;,
				&ldquo;java&rdquo;)</I>). So from the user side, it is very simple
				and normally this is done in a loader like a shared library
				loader. The loader is part of the Universal Component
				Environment.</p>

<p>On the other side, there is the implementation of
				the bridge between two environments. The bridge should create a
				stub very efficiently, and the transformation of the calls from one environment
				to another must be fast. To save disk space and avoid
				the administration of marshaling code, the bridge creates stub
				objects only from a type repository. The type repository contains
				all type information that is necessary. For example, these are the
				methods of an interfaces, the members of structures, and so on.
				The access to the type repository is also provided by the UNO
				runtime library.</p>
The point that makes the transformation
				between two environment fast is the binary UNO specification. The
				transformation, from one environment to the binary UNO
				specification and to the target environment, should be fast. There
				are two other ways to speed up the transformation: First, if two
				components lie in the same environment, the communication between
				them is direct (e.g., a virtual method call in c++) and no
				translation is necessary. Second, you can provide a direct bridge
				between two environments, so the transformation to the binary UNO
				specification is avoided.
			</OL>

<h2><A NAME="Why_our_own_object_model"></A> Why our own object model? </h2>

			<P>The main reason is that the other object models don't provide
			the full functionality. The COM/DCOM model does not provide
			exception handling.</p>

<p>CORBA is normally used for remote communication and there is no local
standard API between objects.</p>

<p>Java RMI is only useful in a Java environment. So we
			can't use an existing standard to implement the object model we
			want to use. But if you look at our object model, then you see
			that we use the IIOP protocol in the remote case, and we use
			reference counting like COM to determine the lifetime of the
			interfaces.</P>

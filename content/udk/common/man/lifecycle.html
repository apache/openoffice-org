<H1>Specification</H1>

<P>This model is built on four abstractions: threads, objects, data items, and
time.</P>

<P>There is a set of <DFN>threads</DFN>, which are not further specified here
(see <A href="execution.html"><CITE>UNO Execution Model</CITE></A> for
details).  At any time, this thread pool owns a specific set of data items.</P>

<P>For simplicity (but without loss of generality), a fixed, infinite set of
<DFN>objects</DFN>,&nbsp;<VAR>O</VAR>, is assumed.  At any time, each object
owns a specific set of data items.</P>

<P><DFN>Data items</DFN> consist of values of the primitive and structured UNO
types (see <A HREF="typesystem.html"><CITE>UNO Type System</CITE></A>), and of
object references (representing the interface types).  An object reference is
either the null reference or a reference to any object <VAR>o</VAR> &isin;
<VAR>O</VAR>.</P>

<P>At any time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>, <VAR>TRef</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> &sube;
<VAR>O</VAR> is the set of <DFN>objects directly referenced from the thread
pool</DFN>.  These are all the objects referenced from the data items owned by
the thread pool at time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>.</P>

<P>At any time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>, for each object <VAR>o</VAR> &isin;
<VAR>O</VAR>, <VAR>ref</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>(<VAR>o</VAR>) &sube;
<VAR>O</VAR> is the set of <DFN>objects directly referenced from
object&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR></DFN>.  These are all the objects referenced from the
data items owned by object&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR> at time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>.
The function <VAR>ref</VAR><SUP>+</SUP><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> is the transitive
hull of the function <VAR>ref</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>; at any
time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>,
<VAR>ref</VAR><SUP>+</SUP><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>(<VAR>o</VAR>) represents the
set of <DFN>objects referenced from object&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR></DFN>.  Viewed as
a relation, <VAR>ref</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> describes a directed graph
with objects as vertices and object references as edges.  An <DFN>object
reference circle</DFN> is a strongly connected component of that graph, with the
restriction that it must contain at least one edge.  (Informally, an object
reference circle is a maximal set of objects where each object can be reached
from every other object via one or more object references.)</P>

<P>At any time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>,
<VAR>TRef</VAR><SUP>+</SUP><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> :=
<VAR>TRef</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> &cup;
<FONT SIZE="+1">&cup;</FONT><SUB><VAR>o</VAR> &isin;
<VAR>TRef</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB></SUB>
<VAR>ref</VAR><SUP>+</SUP><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>(o) is the set of <DFN>objects
referenced from the thread pool</DFN>.</P>

<P>At any time&nbsp;<VAR>t</VAR>, <VAR>O</VAR> can be partitioned into four
disjoint subsets: the <DFN>immaterial objects</DFN>
<VAR>Imm</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>, the <DFN>active objects</DFN>
<VAR>Act</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>, the <DFN>done objects</DFN>
<VAR>Don</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>, and the <DFN>unreachable objects</DFN>
<VAR>Unr</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>.  Two of these are derived as follows:
<VAR>Act</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> :=
<VAR>TRef</VAR><SUP>+</SUP><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>, and
<VAR>Unr</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> := <VAR>O</VAR> \
(<VAR>Imm</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> &cup;
<VAR>Act</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> &cup;
<VAR>Don</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB>).</P>

<H1>Explanation</H1>

<P>Over time, each individual object can transition from <VAR>Imm</VAR> to
<VAR>Act</VAR>, and then to either <VAR>Don</VAR> or <VAR>Unr</VAR>.  Each
object starts out as immaterial.  The set of data items owned by an immaterial
object (and hence its set of directly referenced objects) is empty.  An object
becomes active once it has been created, and stays active as long as it is
referenced from the thread pool.  The set of data items owned by an object (and
hence its set of directly referenced objects) can only change while the object
is active.  An object becomes done once neither it is referenced from the thread
pool, nor is it a member of an object reference circle.  An object becomes
unreachable once it is no longer referenced from the thread pool, but is a
member of an object reference circle.  Unreachable objects are a problem, as
they can cause resource leaks.  A desired strategy is to keep
<VAR>Unr</VAR><SUB><VAR>t</VAR></SUB> empty at all times.</P>

<P>Concepts from different language bindings map to the model's abstractions in
different ways.  Two prototypical languages are C++ (providing constructors and
destructors of objects, but no garbage collection) and Java (providing
constructors and finalizers of objects, with automatic garbage collection).  To
implement the UNO object life cycle model, the C++ language binding uses
reference counting for both internal and external (bridged) objects.  The Java
language binding relies on garbage collection for internal objects, and uses
garbage collection together with reference counting for external (bridged)
objects.</P>

<P>For C++, the relation is as follows.  Calling the constructor of an object
coincides with the object's transition from immaterial to active.  After an
object's transition from active to done, the destructor of that object will
eventually be called.  The destructor is called immediately if the object is
only referenced locally, but it can be delayed arbitrarily if the object is
referenced externally (over a bridge).  Unreachable objects cause memory leaks,
as their destructors are never called.</P>

<P>For Java, the relation is slightly different.  Again, calling the constructor
of an object coincides with the object's transition from immaterial to active.
After an object's transition from active to done, the finalizer of that object
will eventually be called.  For an unreachable object, the finalizer will
eventually be called if the object is only referenced locally; the finalizer
will not be called (and the object will cause a memory leak) if the object is
referenced externally (over a bridge).</P>

<P>This has two implications:</P>
<OL>
    <LI>Object reference circles have to be avoided, as they can cause objects
    to become unreachable.</LI>

    <LI>Neither the C++ destructor, nor the Java finalizer of an object are good
    places to release any resources held by an object, as calling the destructor
    or finalizer can be delayed arbitrarily.</LI>
</OL>

<H1>Application</H1>

<P>There are various strategies how to avoid or break object reference circles,
and how to make objects release resources in a timely fashion.</P>

<H2>Object Ownership</H2>

<P>One strategy to cope with object reference circles is to allow them, but to
ensure that they are broken before the involved objects become unreachable.
Lets assume that {<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, &hellip;,
<VAR>o</VAR><SUB><VAR>n</VAR></SUB>}, <VAR>n</VAR> &ge; 1, form an object
reference circle.  Exactly one of the objects in the circle is required to have
a so-called <DFN>owner</DFN> <VAR>o</VAR>&prime; &notin;
{<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, &hellip;, <VAR>o</VAR><SUB><VAR>n</VAR></SUB>};
assume that <VAR>o</VAR>&prime; is the owner of&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>.
As long as there are <EM>any</EM> references to the circle (from objects outside
the circle, or from the thread pool), it is required that <VAR>o</VAR>&prime;
has a reference to <VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>.</P>

<P>Whenever the reference from the owner&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR>&prime; to
<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> is the only outside reference to the circle, there is a
choice.  Either, the owner decides to keep the circle active, so that other
outside references to the circle can be made in the future.  Or, the owner
decides to be done with the circle.  In that case, <VAR>o</VAR>&prime; must
ensure that the circle does not become unreachable when it cuts its last outside
reference to&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>.  The easiest solution is that
<VAR>o</VAR>&prime; tells <VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> to break the circle, by
clearing all references from <VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> to any of
{<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB>, &hellip;, <VAR>o</VAR><SUB><VAR>n</VAR></SUB>}.  Note
that this only works if the circle is sufficiently simple, i.e., if removing the
references from <VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> does not introduce any new (smaller)
object reference circles.</P>

<P>There are two difficulties with this approach:</P>
<OL>
    <LI>The owner has to notice when it has the only outside reference to the
    circle, so that it can decide whether to keep the circle active or to be
    done with it.</LI>

    <LI>When the owner tells the circle to break, it has to be ensured that the
    chosen algorithm causes no objects to become unreachable (by introducing any
    smaller object reference circles).</LI>
</OL>

<H2>Components</H2>

<P>The approach of <CODE>com.sun.star.lang.XComponent</CODE> is an adaptation of
the object ownership strategy, that tries to avoid the two difficulties
mentioned above.</P>

<P>First, the owned object&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> (implementing
<CODE>com.sun.star.lang.XComponent</CODE>) has a special <DFN>disposed</DFN>
state (to which it transitions when the owner calls the <CODE>dispose</CODE>
method).  In that state, it is still active, but behaves more or less as if it
was done.  This allows the owner to initiate breaking the circle even while
there are still other outside references to it.  Via those other references,
<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> can still be reached, but it will be in its disposed
state.</P>

<P>That way, the owner does not need to notice exactly when it has the only
outside reference to the circle.  Of course, users
of&nbsp;<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> now have to cope with the disposed state.
Generally, it should still be ensured that there is as little access as possible
to the object after it has been disposed.</P>

<P>Second, the <CODE>XComponent</CODE> approach is designed for simple
(subject&ndash;observer) patterns of object reference circles, where
<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>1</SUB> (the <DFN>subject</DFN>) has a reference to each of
{<VAR>o</VAR><SUB>2</SUB>, &hellip;, <VAR>o</VAR><SUB><VAR>n</VAR></SUB>} (the
<DFN>observers</DFN>), and each of the observers has a reference to the subject.
To break such a circle without introducing any new circles, it suffices to clear
all the references from the subject to the observers, for example.</P>

<H2>Weak References</H2>

<P>The combination of <CODE>com.sun.star.uno.XWeak</CODE>/<!--
--><CODE>XAdapter</CODE>/<CODE>XReference</CODE> allows to have weak references
to objects.  As long as the weakly referenced object is active,
<CODE>XAdapter</CODE>'s <CODE>queryAdapted</CODE> returns a (true) reference to
the object.  Once the weakly referenced object is done or unreachable,
<CODE>queryAdapted</CODE> returns either a (true) reference to the object (thus
effectively resurrecting the object), or a null reference.  Weak references can
be used to avoid creating object reference circles, by replacing sufficiently
many (true) references with weak references.</P>

<P><EM>It has to be further investigated how weak references fit in with the UNO
object life cycle model, and the object ownership and <CODE>XComponent</CODE>
strategies presented above.</EM></P>

<H2>Disposing</H2>

<P>As explained, a UNO object that has acquired any references should release
them well before the language binding has determined that the object is no
longer active (e.g., via a destructor or finalizer call), as there can be an
arbitrarily long time span between the object becoming done or unreachable, and
the destructor or finalizer being called.  The UNO object should offer an
explicit mechanism to release its resources, probably as a method of a supported
interface.</P>

<P>This is similar to the object ownership/<CODE>XComponent</CODE> strategy, in
that in both cases some entity has to determine when to dispose an object
(typically, a method named <CODE>dispose</CODE>, or similar, is used in both
cases: in the <CODE>XComponent</CODE> case, disposing is used to break object
reference circles; in this case, disposing is used to make an object release its
resources).  A theoretically appealing solution would be that the last user of
an object holding resources calls <CODE>dispose</CODE> once it has finished
using it, but it can be difficult to determine when this condition occurs.
Again, a simple solution is to introduce a special <DFN>disposed</DFN> state for
the object holding the resources.  Then, some entity can call
<CODE>dispose</CODE> on the object without knowing exactly whether there are
still other references to it (but those other references then have to cope with
the object being in disposed state).</P>

<h1>How to design C++ classes that are part of the SDK
<code>salhelper</code>/<code>cppuhelper</code> API</h1>

<p>The following list gives instructions how to design a C++ class that shall be
part of the API of either <code>salhelper</code> or <code>cppuhelper</code>
(i.e., of any SDK shared library that has a C++ API that is not all-inline).
The motivating force behind those instructions is to minimize the amount of
global symbols (especially weak ones).  The list also explains exactly which
symbols corresponding to a class to export on which platform; see
<a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/libraryversioning.html"><cite>SDK
Dynamic Library Versioning</cite></a> for details about adding exported symbols
to dynamic libraries.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Never define inline functions.  (Neither explicitly nor
implicitly, by defining a function within its class.  Inline functions,
especially constructors and destructors, often make it necessary to export
certain symbols that could otherwise be left unexported.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure that the compiler does not declare any implicit
functions.  (To avoid any implicitly defined inline functions, see point&nbsp;1.
Potential implicit functions are default constructors, copy constructors,
destructors, and copy assignment operators.  The easiest way to avoid them is to
declare a destructor, at least one copy constructor, and at least one copy
assignment operator for each class; those declared functions that shall not be
available can be declared private and left undefined.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define every destructor that is declared.  (Even a destructor
that is declared pure virtual, to avoid any implicitly defined inline functions,
see point&nbsp;1.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a class type (possibly <em>cv</em>-qualified, and possibly
nested within pointer or reference types) is ever used either</p>
<ul>
    <li>as a <em>type-id</em> within a <code>dynamic_cast</code> expression that
    needs to be evaluated at runtime,</li>

    <li> as the static type of an <em>expression</em> within a
    <code>dynamic_cast</code> expression that needs to be evaluated at
    runtime,</li>

    <li>as a <em>type-id</em> within a <code>typeid</code> expression,</li>

    <li>as the static type of an <em>expression</em> within a
    <code>typeid</code> expression,</li>

    <li>as the static type of an <em>assignment-expression</em> within a
    <code>throw</code> expression, or</li>

    <li>within the <em>exception-declaration</em> of a <code>catch</code>
    handler,</li>
</ul>
<p>then declare its destructor virtual.  (To have a dedicated place where RTTI
for that class is generated.  Since in general you cannot control the ways a
class is used, the best advice probably is to do this for each class that is
intended to be either used as an exception or subclassed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the destructor of a class is declared virtual, declare the
destructors of all its base classes virtual.  (To have a dedicated place where
RTTI for the base classes is generated, which is referenced by the RTTI for the
derived class.  Since in general you cannot control the ways a class is used,
the best advice probably is to do this for each class that is intended to be
subclassed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special symbols to be exported for GCC&nbsp;3:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For each constructor that shall be available outside the dynamic
    library, export any corresponding <code>C1</code> and <code>C2</code>
    variant symbols.</li>

    <li>For each destructor that shall be available outside the dynamic library,
    export any corresponding <code>D0</code>, <code>D1</code>, and
    <code>D2</code> variant symbols.  (The <code>D0</code> variant seems to be
    never called directly, but only be referenced from the vtable, but that is
    no guarantee that this will not change in a future GCC version.)</li>

    <li>For each class that is used outside the dynamic library in ways covered
    by point&nbsp;4 plus recursive application of point&nbsp;5, export the
    corresponding <code>_ZTI</code> and <code>_ZTS</code> symbols.  (Strictly
    speaking, the <code>_ZTS</code> symbol need only be exported if the type is
    ever used as an incomplete type.)</li>

    <li>It is known that some classes are used in ways covered by point&nbsp;4
    plus recursive application of point&nbsp;5, and those classes have no
    dedicated place where RTTI for them is generated, and thus weak RTTI symbols
    are emitted wherever needed (classes affected by this are, for example, the
    all-inline classes representing UNO exception types, and all-inline
    exception classes like <code>rtl::MalformedUriException</code>; specifically
    <em>not</em> affected are the standard exception classes
    <code>std::bad_alloc</code>, <code>std::bad_cast</code>,
    <code>std::bad_exception</code>, <code>std::bad_typeid</code>,
    <code>std::domain_error</code>, <code>std::exception</code>,
    <code>std::invalid_argument</code>, <code>std::ios_base::failure</code>,
    <code>std::length_error</code>, <code>std::logic_error</code>,
    <code>std::out_of_range</code>, <code>std::overflow_error</code>,
    <code>std::range_error</code>, <code>std::runtime_error</code>, and
    <code>std::underflow_error</code>, as they all have dedicated places for
    their RTTI symbols in <code>libstlport_gcc.so</code> or
    <code>libstdc++.so.5</code>).  To make those uses work under GCC&nbsp;3, all
    involved load objects have to bind the same definitions of those symbols at
    runtime.  To achieve this, the OOo build environment enforces that
    <em>all</em> global <code>_ZTI</code> and <code>_ZTS</code> symbols defined
    within a load object (as either weak or normal symbols) are indeed exported
    (with version <code>GCC_3_0_0</code>, in case the respective load object
    uses symbol versioning).  This implies that any <code>_ZTI</code> and
    <code>_ZTS</code> symbols covered by the previous point are always exported
    with version <code>GCC_3_0_0</code>, which defeats the correct use of
    versioning for those symbols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special symbols to be exported for Sun C++ 5:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For each constructor that shall be available outside the dynamic
    library, export any corresponding plain and <code>#Nvariant&nbsp;1</code>
    variant symbols.</li>

    <li>For each destructor that shall be available outside the dynamic library,
    export any corresponding plain and <code>#Nvariant&nbsp;1</code> variant
    symbols.</li>

    <li>For each class that is used outside the dynamic library in ways covered
    by point&nbsp;4 plus recursive application of point&nbsp;5, export the
    corresponding <code>__RTTI__</code> symbols (of which there are three, one
    for the class itself, one for an unqualified pointer to the class, and one
    for a <code>const</code>-qualified pointer to the class).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special symbols to be exported for Microsoft Visual C++:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For each constructor that shall be available outside the dynamic
    library, export the corresponding symbol.</li>

    <li>For each destructor that shall be available outside the dynamic library,
    export the corresponding symbol (do not export any <code>`scalar deleting
    destructor'</code> or <code>`vector deleting destructor'</code>
    symbols).</li>
</ul>
</ol>

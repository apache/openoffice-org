<h1>Conceptual Model</h1>

<p>We use the term &ldquo;component&rdquo; here in a very limited, well defined
sense.  Unfortunately, within the broader field, and even within UNO itself, the
term is also used with other meanings, typically to mean some form of collection
of what is here called components.</p>

<p>A <dfn>UNO component</dfn> is the smallest unit in the UNO component model.
A UNO component is a software artifact that has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A component has a <dfn>component implementation name</dfn>, by which it
    is known to its deployment environment.  Component implementation names are
    always relative to a given deployment environment.</li>

    <li>To describe the interface that clients of a component can use, the
    component links to a <dfn>component client interface</dfn> via a
    <dfn>component client interface name</dfn>.</li>

    <li>One of the more obvious requirements a component has on its deployment
    environment is that the component itself will be a client of other
    components, which it uses internally in its implementation.  To describe
    this requirement, a component has <dfn>component dependencies</dfn>, a map
    from <dfn>component instantiation names</dfn> to <dfn>component client
    interface names</dfn>.<br/>
    The component dependencies only cover <em>static</em> dependencies.  A
    component may also have <em>dynamic</em> dependencies; for example, at
    runtime an instance of that component may take an input&nbsp;<var>N</var>,
    compute a service instantiation name&nbsp;<var>N</var>&prime; from it, and
    expect to obtain a component instance with a certain component client
    interface when passing <var>N</var>&prime; to the component manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <dfn>component client interface</dfn> is a set of UNO interface types
(referenced by their&mdash;globally unique&mdash;names), together with a marker
for each interface type, denoting it as either <dfn>mandatory</dfn> or
<dfn>optional</dfn>, and semantic constraints on the functionality of those
interface types and the runtime presence of any optional interface types.  There
is one constraint on the set of interface types: no optional interface type from
the set may be an (indirect) base type of any mandatory interface type from the
set.</p>

<p>Each component client interfaces is associated with a globally unique
<dfn>component client interface name</dfn>.  This association must be globally
unique; otherwise, clients of a component (who describe their expectations of
the component by means of a component client interface name) could not be sure
that, at runtime, they receive a component instance that meets their
expectations.  (This requirement of globally unique names for component client
interfaces is the same as for named UNO types.)</p>

<p>At runtime, instances of UNO components can be obtained from a <dfn>component
manager</dfn>.  The component instances are UNO objects that behave according to
their respective component client interfaces.  A component manager works based
on <dfn>component instantiation names</dfn>.  Each code that uses a component
manager must document what component instances (adhering to which component
client interfaces) it expects to obtain from the component manager, with which
component instantiation names.  Throughout the lifetime of a component instance,
that instance has access to a certain component manager; what other component
instances the instance itself expects to obtain from that component manager is
documented by the component's component dependencies (but note that this only
covers the component's static dependencies).</p>

<h1>How UNO Implements the Conceptual Model</h1>

<p>Components are often also called <dfn>services</dfn> in UNO.  The conceptual
component client interfaces are implemented as UNOIDL service descriptions,
whose names serve as the conceptual component client interface names.  The
conceptual properties of components are represented in UNO as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The conceptual component implementation name breaks up into two parts.
    First, each component has an implementation name, which must be unique
    within the deployment environment (see
    <code>com.sun.star.lang.XServiceInfo.getImplemenationName</code>).  Second,
    the <code>services.rdb</code> registry associates each implementation name
    with an activator (e.g., <code>com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary</code>) and
    an activator-dependent location (e.g., a platform-dependent shared library
    pathname, in case of the <code>com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary</code>
    loader).</li>

    <li>The association of a component with a component client interface is
    again done in the <code>services.rdb</code> registry, by associating each
    implementation name with one or more UNOIDL service description names.</li>

    <li>The conceptual component dependencies are not actually recorded for a
    UNO component.  Rather, they can implicitly be derived from the component's
    code.  However, with the XML module description approach, they would be
    recorded as (optional) <code>service-dependency</code> elements.  Each
    <code>service-dependency</code> element contains the name of a UNOIDL
    service description, serving as both the component instantiation name and
    the component client interface name.</li>
</ul>

<p>A UNOIDL service description appears to be richer than a corresponding
conceptual component client interface (which, after all, is little more than a
set of UNO interface types with associated semantic constraints).  But all of
this additional richness can be reduced to syntactic sugar:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A UNOIDL service description implicitly adds
    <code>com.sun.star.uno.XWeak</code>,
    <code>com.sun.star.lang.XTypeProvider</code>, and
    <code>com.sun.star.lang.XServiceInfo</code> to the set of interface types,
    with respective constraints on their functionality (e.g.,
    <code>com.sun.star.lang.XTypeProvider.getTypes</code> must return all the
    mandatory interface types covered by the service description).</li>

    <li>A UNOIDL service description can contain property declarations.  These
    map to functional constraints on an explicitly or implicitly exported
    interface type like <code>com.sun.star.beans.XPropertySet</code>.  For
    example, if a UNOIDL service description contains the property declaration
    <code>[property] long P</code>, and exports the mandatory interface type
    <code>com.sun.star.beans.XPropertySet</code>, then there is the functional
    constraint that a call to <code>XPropertySet.getPropertyValue("P")</code>
    returns an <code>ANY</code> value of type <code>LONG</code>.</li>

    <li>A UNOIDL service description can contain other service descriptions,
    marked as either mandatory or optional.  This can be considered a textual
    inclusion mechanism (the contents of the contained service description is
    copied into the containing service description, marking all copied entities
    as optional in case the contained service description was marked as
    optional), together with possible functional constraints on the resulting
    component client interface (e.g., if an optional included service
    description exported two mandatory interface types, then
    <code>com.sun.star.lang.XTypeProvider.getTypes</code> at runtime must return
    either both of them or neither of them).</li>
</ul>

<p>In UNO, the conceptual component managers are instances of
<code>com.sun.star.lang.ServiceManager</code>.  UNO does not distinguish between
the conceptional component client interface names and component instantiation
names&mdash;the names of UNOIDL service descriptions are used for both
cases.</p>

<p>When a component instance is created at runtime, it is passed a
<code>com.sun.star.uno.XComponentContext</code>, through which it has access to
a <code>com.sun.star.lang.ServiceManager</code>.  The guarantee that this
<code>ServiceManager</code> fulfils the component's component dependencies is
indirect and weak: since component instantiation names are (globally unique)
names of UNOIDL service descriptions, which in turn are the same as component
client interface names, it is guaranteed that if a <code>ServiceManager</code>
returns any component instance at all for a given component instantiation name
from the component dependencies, then that instance will adhere to the
corresponding component client interface from the component dependencies.
However, there is no guarantee that the <code>ServiceManager</code> does not
return null instead.  Also, there is no way to guarantee that a component's
dynamic dependencies are satisfied.</p>

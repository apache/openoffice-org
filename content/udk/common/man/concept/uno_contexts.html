<h2 id="abstract">Abstract </h2>

<p>This draft is about UNO contexts; what they are, how and under what condition
        they make sense, and when you should use them. UNO contexts are generic
        containers for storing arbitrary values that are either used by components
        to get their deployment settings or control the runtime behavior of a
        component.</p>
        <p>Contexts are classified into static (component) contexts and dynamic (current)
        contexts. A component context provides a component's deployment values;
        a current context provides task-local values, such as values that are transferred
        implicitly via a chain of calls excluding other tasks having access to
        these values.</p>
        <p>The following section, <a href="#intro"><i>Introduction</i></a>,
        introduces the topic with an example.
				The next two sections (<a href="#component_context"><i>Component
        Context</i></a> and <a href="#current_context"><i>Current Context</i></a>)
        present a definition and API proposal for the component and current context
        as well as a migration path for the current API.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last section proposes <a href="#component_descr"><i>Extensions to the XML Component Description</i></a>, 
        
	<a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/module_description.html">component description</a> by describing deployment properties of a component
        implementation and invariants.
      </p>

<h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>

	  <p>A component implements a service (defined in UNO-IDL), that is, at
	    least the defined set of supported
        interfaces of the service. The service builds up the contract
        between component implementor and component user which is the way a component
        can be accessed and used. In general, interfaces abstract from system
        and implementation details to allow that a component implementation may
        be exchanged for another. Therefore, component users should generally
        not rely on a actually running component implementation. This is a desired
        feature of components: handle them as isolated as possible. Changing
        an interface or in general changing the way a component's functionality
        is accessed is difficult, because client code has to be revisited
        even for minor changes.
		This is not always possible, if, for example, software has been
		developed by 3rd party engineers.  </p>
      <p><img src="../images/context_example1.gif" align=right hspace=60 alt="context example"/> For
        further explanations, consider the following example:
	A DataService is providing
        data in a generic way, abstracting from the specific sources from which it gets
        the data.  This approach is often chosen in software systems, because
	it is a flexible way of extending to unknown data sources, thus avoiding
	the need to touch the DataService.</p>
	<p>Specific DataProvider components are plugged under
	the generic DataService. The user runs the DataService giving a uniform
	address for the data he wants to access, not knowing which specific
	DataProvider is performing the request. The latter concerns
	deployment aspects of actually existing data sources on the machine.</p>
    <p>Running the example component on a big machine, you may want to switch
        on caching of data to speed up access. Also, in keeping the set of interfaces
        small, the service should not directly export an interface like <code>XCache</code>
        or have interfaces polluted by caching flags in its access methods. The
        set of interfaces and their methods should be kept minimal for extensive
        use.</p>
     <p>You also don't want to be implementing another set of interfaces
        just to support caching functionality. It is even worse if the
        DataProviders access further sub-services that should take caching into
        account. In the latter case, every calling instance has to manage the
        caching settings being propagated to the called instance. Eventually,
        not all sub-services support caching functionality, but need
        to forward the setting without knowing anything about it.</p>
     <p>Last, you want a sensible (thus often different) caching policy being
	deployed, if your application is being installed on a small or a big machine.
	</p>
      <p><b>Consequences</b></p>
	  <p>You want to parameterize a components' implementation, even if it is
	     accessed indirectly in a somehow weaker way than thru IDL interfaces.</p>
	  <p>To state clearly: Of course, it is always the best solution to
	    specify a component
        comprehensively by IDL interfaces, but it is also common sense to keep
        a service description as minimal (but sufficient) and generic as possible,
        and avoid specifics of the underlying system.</p>
       <p>This creates a conflict: In general, it is forbidden to use anything
        out of a service's implementation that is not part of the service description.
        So, by definition, you can only depend (and rely) on the service description.
        On the other hand, as stated above, you may want it for convenience and
        API design reasons. So there is no silver bullet, for the minority
        of cases where one needs a possibility to customize a component's implementation
        in a documented way.</p>
      <p><b>Solution Proposal</b></p>
      <p>A convenient (extendable) solution would be, if each component were
		granted a set of named properties when it is raised. This is called a
		UNO context. It provides deployment data to the component.</p>
	  <p>Upon raising further component
		instances, the set of properties (context) is forwarded.  The actually
		affected component of a property takes it into account and behaves as
		documented (see <a href="#component_descr">
	extensions to the XML component description</a>). All other instances, in the
        chain of raised components, ignore settings that are unknown to them. So
        the modification of a property requires global knowledge about what
        components get affected. You have to know if a specific property will
        be taken into account, but <b>not</b> necessarily by which component
        instance, in general, you don't know what further components are instantiated
		when raising a specific component (this is an implementation detail).
		The latter point requires a clear documentation scheme of a component's
		deployment properties.
	  </p>
	  <p>The previous example states the deployment of a component, that is
		when the component is installed for example by an application
		installation. Enabling or disabling caching, the cache size, et cetera
		-- these properties are basically
        of a static nature, because the underlying system won't change during execution
        of the application. For flexibility, there may be the need to switch it
        on or off depending on the current system load. You may do this on a per-instance
        basis (customizing a component instance) or  per-call basis (customizing for the
        current execution only). The latter aspect is clearly of a dynamic nature.
      An example usage case may be a low-level socket API, extended by error handling
      capabilities without changing the socket API.
      </p>
      <p>
        To summarize the above:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>deployment properties for component implementations,</p></li>
        <li><p>public definition and documentation of properties (this may include
          invariants to test consistent deployment),</p></li>
        <li><p>implicit propagation of properties when raising further components,</li>
        <li><p>static customization: per component class (deployment) and per instance,</p></li>
        <li><p>dynamic customization: per call.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the mentioned customization of UNO components
        is referred to as "UNO contexts". A UNO context delivers additional
        runtime information for component execution. UNO contexts provide a set
        of named values like a property bag. You can retrieve values by
		their names; this is flexible for modifications without changing the
		context interface.</p>
	  <p>There is a distinction between static and dynamic contexts: A static
	    context
        (also referred as the "component context") may be used simultaneously
	(e.g. by multiple threads), is immutable,
        and is commonly given when a component is instantiated. The component
        context is divided into a factory context that is accessible by all instances
        of a component and provides persistent values to the component.
        In addition, there is the specific component context given at instantiation
        time, which was eventually customized by the caller that raised the component
        instance.
        In contrast, a dynamic context (also referred as the "current context")
        is implicitly provided by a calling task (e.g. a calling thread)
        to the component.</p>
	   <p>The previous example sketched again, modifying the DataProvider's
	    caching behavior on a per-instance basis:</p>
        <p>
        <img src="../images/context_example2.gif" hspace=60 alt="another context example"/>
        </p>
	   <p>The caller prepares a context, putting the caching entry
	    "DataProvider.CacheOn = true" before raising the DataService.</p>
       <p>A subsequently called DataProvider1 recognizes a "DataProvider.CacheOn"
        flag. DataProvider2 ignores the caching properties, because it does not
        support caching at all.</p>
       <p>The caching property is defined as "optional", meaning it need not be
        set and the affected component may choose a default behavior if it is
        not set. Another attribute for a customization property is "mandatory", 
        stating that a property must be configured for running a component.</p>
      <p>An automatic consistency test for a deployment involves, at least, the testing
      of all invariants specified for properties. In general, invariants should
      be implemented by the component that uses the involved properties.
      Simple invariants may also be specified in the component description of
      the implementation, e.g. <code>&lt;invariant type="min" value="128"/&gt;</code>.
      For further details, have a look at the <a href="#component_descr">extensions
      to the XML component description</a>.
        </p>
	<p>
        In general, the following figure sketches context propagation along to several instances
	(single factory context for all components):

	  arbitrary values by their name.  A value once retrieved via the context
	  interface will remain unmodified, which means, you retrieve the same
	  value by calling it a second time (immutable).  Method
	  <code>getServiceManager()</code> has been added, because the service
	  manager instance is often needed by component implementations: </p>

	  <p>The factory context of a component is initialized when the system is

        Commonly one factory context for all components is read out of a central

      <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Uno/Cpp/Tutorials/Introduction_to_Cpp_Uno#Setting.2F_Retrieving_the_Current_Context">support for C/C++ by the <code>cppu</code> runtime</a> and the Java UNO runtime, although currently the context is not bridged.
      The current context's interface is
      <a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/uno/XCurrentContext.html"><code>com.sun.star.uno.XCurrentContext</code></a>:
      </p>
      <table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffaa">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
module com { module sun { module star { module uno {

interface XCurrentContext : com::sun::star::uno::XInterface
{
    any getValueByName( [in] string Name );
};

}; }; }; };
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>It is always recommended to use an interface method to pass parameters,
      due to explicit passing and type safety of parameters (caller's and
      callee's contract). Though there are very few sensible cases for a current
      context, common properties of the context are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><b>access control restriction ("access-control.restriction") :
	     <code>type com.sun.star.security.XAccessControlContext</code></b></p>
		 <p>This property provides a task-local access control restriction
		 taken into account during permission checks.  For details, have a look
		 at <a href="uno_security.html#dynamic_restrictions">the dynamic
		 restrictions</a> section of the security document.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>access control user credentials ("access-control.user-credentials.*")</b></p>
		<p>These properties relate to the calling user, e.g.
		<code>access-control.user-credentials.id</code>.  For details, have a
		look at <a href="uno_security.html#dynamic_restrictions">the dynamic
		restrictions</a> section of the security document.</p>
	</li>
    <li><p>arbitrary values for higher stack levels which occur in an
		  "optional" manner (could be described as "nice to have if set at the
		  current context") like callback/ error handlers.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The current context interface reference must not be shared with other
	  threads.
      In general, you should also take care to not share values you got from the
      current context with other threads.</p>
	  <p>When calling across process boundaries, there is a question of what
	  happens to
      the dynamic context. Of course, remote transparency is a wishful feature.
      On the other hand, remote access on the context has to be optimized for 
      performance.</p>

<!--        <i><font color="#ff0000">Open</font>:</i> Security and inter process
        calls?<br/>
        I propose that security relevant properties like the AccessController or
	the authenticated Subject are not
	transmitted, because this leads to a potential security hole (refer to
	<a href="uno_security.html#remote">security draft</a>).<br/>
      A process for handling this via remote may be establishing a lasting authentication
      (over multiple calls) for a user. A previous authentication process (including
      password dialogs, etc.) will establish a ticket on both sides (aka secure
      association). This ticket builds up the subject. When transferring via remote,
      only the ticket is transferred, then any authorization has to be performed
      on the (locally authenticated) user's behalf. <br/>

<h2 id="component_descr"> Extensions to the XML Component Description </h2>

<p>In this section, I propose extensions to the current <a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/module_description.html">XML
        component description</a> describing deployment properties of a component
        implementation and invariants.
	Invariants allow testing of a specific deployment, that is, if the specific values
	make sense.
        All elements appear as sub element of <code>component-description</code> which, now, may
        also contain a <code>component-properties</code> element:</p>

      <table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffaa">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
&lt;!ELEMENT component-description
          (author,name,description,loader-name,supported-service+,
           <b>component-properties?</b>,(%component-description-optional;)*)&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT component-properties property*&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT property description? invariant*&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST property name CDATA #REQUIRED
                   optional (true|false) #IMPLIED
                   value-type (boolean|string|number) #IMPLIED
                   default-value CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT invariant EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST invariant type (valid|invalid|min|max) #REQUIRED
                    value CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

	  <p>Properties are described by their <code>name</code>,
	  <code>value-type</code>, <code>optional</code> attributes, and a number
	  of optional <code>invariant</code>s.  The <code>name</code> denotes the
	  property's name as it will appear in contexts.  The <code>optional</code>
	  attribute denotes whether the property can optionally
	  be set in a deployment or is mandatory (i.e. if not set, the component
	  implementation
      cannot run).  An optional <code>default-value</code> can also be set.
      Invariants follow up as sub elements
	  to check whether a given property value makes sense. The invariants given
	  <code>value</code>
      must always be convertible to the property's <code>value-type</code>.</p>
	  <p>Current invariant <code>type</code>s have been chosen for the
	  following strings:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><code>valid</code> -- denotes a valid value of the property overriding all other invariants</li>
      <li><code>invalid</code> -- denotes an invalid value of the property overriding all other invariants except the
      <code>valid</code> invariant</li>
      <li><code>min</code> -- denotes a lower boundary for a property number value</li>
      <li><code>max</code> -- denotes a upper boundary for a property number value</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffaa">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre>
...
&lt;component-properties&gt;
 &lt;property name="DataProvider1.CacheOn" value-type="boolean"/&gt;
 &lt;property name="DataProvider1.CacheSize" value-type="number" default-value="256"&gt;
  &lt;invariant type="min" value="128"/&gt;
  &lt;invariant type="max" value="512"/&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
  Property CacheOn controls whether caching of data should be performed.
  Property CacheSize controls the size of the cache.  The CacheSize is limited to a range
  between 128 and 512.
  &lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/component-properties&gt;
...
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
      <i><font color="#ff0000">Attention: Proposal only!</font></i>
      The previous component description extensions
      are yet to be discussed and extended -- and implemented -- 
      with respect to further tools performing tests.

<h2 id="oneinstance"> Migration path for existing OneInstance services </h2>

<p>Formerly, a service decided to be a one instance service by choosing the appropriate factory
( in general cppu::createOneInstanceFactory() ). When the service is first instantiated,
the factory keeps a hard reference to the service. All subsequent createInstance()-calls
return the same object. When the servicemanager got disposed, it disposed all factories,
which released the reference.

<p> The former OneInstance services can be separated into the following categories :

<ol>
<li><p>Services that have state or instantiate other services.</p></li>
<li><p>Services that don't have state and that don't instantiate further
     services.
     These services are OneInstance for optimization reasons
     ( it would be a waste of heap to have multiple instances).
	 A classical example is the TypeConverter services, which offers simple
	 conversion functions.
   </p></li>
</ol>

Each group must be treated differently when moving to the context concept.

<ol>
<li><p>These are
<a href="#singleton">singletons</a>.
These objects should be placed into the context.
You use a normal factory, so that it is possible to instantiate multiple instances.
You add a singleton entry to the idl-file. All clients, that previously accessed the object
via the servicemanager, must switch to accessing it via a context. This is a required change.
</p>
<p> If there is not time to make the changes immediately, then stick to the OneInstance
service, as it is currently, and schedule a task force for it.
</p>

<p> There may be exceptions, for instance, the javavm service can only be started once per process and
    it must not die (because the javavm can not be released once it has been started).
	Such conditions should be handled by the component internally, that is, the javavm-service
	will hold its self or it will keep a list of the contexts it is used in, and adds itself as
	disposing listeners. These exceptions should be really rare !
	</p>

<p> Another possibility may be to make it a normal service.</p>

<li><p>These services can be reused over all contexts, so a single instance per
process is
desired. These services should use a normal factory, but within the dll-local createInstance()
function, they keep a static weak reference on the object. For every createInstance()-call,
it first checks the weak reference. Otherwise, it instantiates the implementation and assigns
it to the weak reference.
</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="registries"> Registry considerations for context-information </h2>
<p>The following deployment issues arise when introducing contexts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is need for a place to store the singleton information (i.e. the
     name of the service
     to be instantiated when a singleton gets accessed the first time).</p></li>
<li><p>There is need for a place to store implementation-dependent context settings.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Singleton</h4>
<p>A singleton gets a service-name assigned in an idl-file (which means at
specification time). For example, the com.sun.star.theBridgeFactory-singleton
is assigned to the com.sun.star.bridge.BridgeFactory service and can be
instantiated at runtime using this name.</p>
<p>But the specification in idl is only minimal, the singleton instance must,
<b>at least</b>, support this service. Take a look at the service-manager;
something that we call a service-manager must at least support the

<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/lang/MulitServiceFactory.html">
com.sun.star.lang.MultiServiceFactory</a>

service, so this is specified in IDL. However, in OpenOffice.org, we need a
<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/common/ref/com/sun/star/lang/RegistryServiceFactory.html">
com.sun.star.lang.RegistryServiceFactory</a>
service, which additionally supports the MultiServiceFactory.
This information can't be retrieved from IDL anymore, it must be defined at
deployment time.</p>

<p>
The initial routine, that creates the context, must be able to access the
singleton-information.  This information should be provided in an .rdb-file
(the only persistent storage we have on the UDK-level).  The following kinds of
information is currently stored in an .rdb-file:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Types (needed by the typeprovider),</p></li>
<li><p>Service registrations (needed by the RegistryServiceManager),</li>
<li><p>Singleton information (needed by the initial routine that creates the
context).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think a good strategy is to have one .rdb-file for each category. This
avoids unnecessary nesting of registries and gives the most flexibility when
multiple processes shall share registries (though it always needs to be taken
into account that a registry can only be opened with write access, when no
other process have read or write access to the same registry). To reflect this,
we should introduce the following bootstrap-variables :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>UNO_TYPESRDB    (contains a list of registry-names that contain type information
                      [read-only-access])</p></li>
<li><p>UNO_SERVICESRDB (contains a list of registry-names that contain the registered services
                      [read-only-access])</p></li>
<li><p>UNO_CONTEXTRDB  (contains a list of registry-names that contain the singleton-information
                      [read-only-access])</p></li>
<li><p>UNO_SERVICESRDB_RW (contains exactly one registry name where service information
                      can be written)</p></li>
</ul>

Note that you still can have one registry, that holds all information (types,services, and contexts).
This registry would get opened three times, which bears no problem as long as it is
opened for read only.

<h4>Additional context settings</h4>
<p>The context contains (besides singletons) component specific values. This
information
must be available when the context is created, so, it seems a good idea to insert this information
into the above suggested .rdb-file.</p>

<p> The registry does not offer to store all possible UNO-types, since it must store the value as
a byte-sequence ( with some routines such as any2Sequence() and sequence2Any() in cppu).</p>

<p> There needs to be a command line-tool, that inserts values into a rdb.</p>

<h4>Integration into the build process</h4>
<p>There is no comprehensive solution-suggestion currently, so here are listed
some thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The singleton-information specified in IDL must be available outside
	 udkapi/offapi project.  This should be delivered as its own .rdb-file
	 (maybe udk_singleton.rdb).</p></li>
<li><p>If we come to the conclusion
	 that the creation of the service-manager will probably always be hardcoded, it should be
	 sufficient, currently, for most tools not to have a context .rdb-file.</p></li>
<li><p>How do we get a context.rdb for an application? The knowledge on what
     should be in the
     context.rdb is distributed.</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li> The component developer wants to give some sensible defaults to context values.
	 <li> At the time the setup for a certain application is built, one wants to insert
	      only those context values that could be needed in the deployed application.
		  Here it will be very difficult to avoid redundancies for multiple applications.
     <li> The setup wants to install only context values for installed components and it
	      wants to omit other ones.
     <li> The user/deployer wants to modify or add context values.
	 </ul>

</ul>

<h4>Registry limitations</h4>
<p>A lot of deployment problems arise from storing information into an
.rdb-file. We definitely need a database in core UNO as soon as possible.
It is planned to use the configuration services for this and to move component
registration into it.  This will ease getting overviews about components,
implementations, properties, singletons, location, et cetera.
Registry database files (rdb) are only used for type access.</p>
<p>The coming structure of the configuration (which is read-only accessible via
the component context) will look like this:</p>

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#ffffaa"><tr><td><pre>
/singletons/theFoobar/
    service = Foobar
    [arguments = { ... }]
...

/services/Foobar/
    available-implementations = { FbImpl[, ...] }
    uses-implementation = FbImpl
    [&lt;arbitrary conceptional properties&gt;]
...

/implementations/FbImpl/
    supports-services = { Foobar[, ...] }
    url = libfoobar.so
    activator = com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary
    [&lt;arbitrary properties&gt;]

<h2 id="todos">Things left to do... </h2>

<p>The following things are left to do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>[high priority]: </b>
There is currently no persistent storage for component context values,
singleton object specifications, services, and implementations.  This includes
switching service registration to this storage format.</p>
<p>We have to use the configuration services as soon as possible, that is,
bring configuration into UDK.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>[mid priority]: </b>
Supporting <code>XMultiServiceFactory</code> the service manager has to be
revisited.  The service manager has to clone itself (changes
<code>DefaultContext</code> property) when a
<code>createInstanceWithContext</code> changes the context of the component to
be raised.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>[low priority]: </b>
The current context is not transferred via the URP-UNO interprocess bridge.
This has to be fixed with no lack of performance.</p>
</li>

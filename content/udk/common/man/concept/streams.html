	This chapter introduces some notions that you will come across
	later in this document.</DT>

	<DT>
	A <B>datasource</B> is an object, that has some data. A <B>datasink</B>
	is an object that gets some data. Note that no assumption is made
	about how data is transferred, only the direction of dataflow is
	fixed (Fig 1.). Note also, that one object can be datasource and
	datasink at the same time, for example a filter receives data from
	somewhere (=sink), modifies this data, and broadcasts this data again
	(=source).</DT>
	<DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_source_sink.gif" NAME="Rahmen1" ALT="Rahmen1" WIDTH=298 HEIGHT=164 BORDER=0/>
	</DT><DT>
	Datasources and datasinks can be <B>active</B> or
	<B>passive</B>.
	</DT>
	<DT>
	1) A <B><I>datasink</I></B> is <B><I>active</I></B>
	when in the thread of execution the datasink calls a method of
	datasource to get some data. In this case, the <B><I>datasource </I></B>is
	<B><I>passive</I></B>.</DT>
	<DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_active_sink.gif" NAME="Rahmen2" ALT="Rahmen2" WIDTH=296 HEIGHT=165 BORDER=0/>
	</dt><dt>
	2) A <B><I>datasource</I></B> is <B><I>active</I></B>
	when in the thread of execution the datasource calls a method of
	datasink to write some data. In this case, the <B><I>datasink</I></B>
	is <B><I>passive</I></B>.</DT><DT>

	</DT><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Streams offer fixed interfaces to do the data transfer.
	At the lowest level, streams transport bytes. Data does not need to be
	transported in one piece but can be sliced into multiple pieces. To
	reflect the two cases above, there exist <B>inputstreams</B> and
	<B>outputstreams</B>. Inputstreams are used in the active
	sink-passive source scenario and outputstreams are used in the
	active source-passive sink scenario.</DT></DL>

<UL>
	<LI>
	Easy to implement and short interface. Few interfaces to start with.
	Extension interfaces to make the component more flexible and

	<LI>Allow easy <I>chaining</I> and

	<LI>Symmetric interfaces. The input/output symmetry of the

<H4> The 1<SUP>st</SUP> level : XInputStream/XOutputStream </H4>

<DL>
	<DT>A basic streaming facility can be
	implemented with XInputStream or XOutputStream alone.</DT><DT>
	Example (see also the <a href="#introduction">introduction chapter</a>) :</DT>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	There is an object source that has some data, and an
	object sink that wants to get some data. There are two possibilities

	source implements an XInputStream and sink reads
	actively from it. In this case, source is a <B><I>passive-data-source</I></B>
	and sink is an <I><B>active-data-sink</B>.</I>
	<LI>sink implements an XOutputStream and source

<h4> The 2<SUP>nd</SUP> level : XActiveDataSink2/XActiveDataSource2 </h4>
  <dl>
	<dt style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">To make the above sample code more
	flexible, the sink class may
	implement XActiveDataSink. Calling the setInputStream()-method
	informs the sink from where to read the data. Thus the code becomes
	more generic, (sink is only required to support the small
	XActiveDataSink rather than Reference&lt; XXXXXXX &gt; ).</DT>
	<DT style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	When to start the data transfer, depends on the implementer of
	XActiveDataSink.
	</DT>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Here there are three possibilities.
	</DT></DL>
<OL>
	<LI> In the call to XActiveDataSink.setInputStream() the whole data
	transfer is done. This is the worst possibility, because a user may
	not expect a set-method to behave this way.

	<LI>The call to
	XActiveDataSink.setInputStream() starts a thread that does the
	data transfer. This is a better solution, because the call is not
	blocking. Nevertheless the user must still be aware, that everything
	is well prepared for transfer when the call is made.
	
	<LI>The call to XActiveDataSink2.setInputStream() just informs
	the object where to read from. The start of data transfer is done
	over another method. This may be the start()-method of
	XActiveDataContro2 (see below).
</OL>

<DL>
	<DT>The 3<SUP>rd</SUP> solution is by far the best one, because 1) +
	2) are more difficult to reuse and may lead to deadlocks, etc.</DT>
	<DT>
	Note that everything said about XActiveDataSink also holds for
	XActiveDataSource.</DT>
</DL>

<h3> 2.2.1 Chaining </h3>
<DL>
	<DT>An interesting application of the first 2 interface-levels is
	the <B>chaining</B> concept.
	</DT>
	<DT>
	Imagine you have written the XInputStream implementation OFile, that
	offers raw data stored in a file. Then you have an arbitrary
	application, that has implemented XActiveDataSource. After you have
	connected both objects via setInputStream(), you have the connection
	shown in Fig. 6a.</DT>
	<DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_chaining.gif" NAME="Rahmen6" ALT="Rahmen6" WIDTH=586 HEIGHT=349 BORDER=0/>
	</DT><DT>
	Now a file shall be read, that uses a different file format. One
	could either modify OFile or application to do the conversion, but
	there is a better solution. An independent service OConverter can be
	used, it implements XActiveDataSink and XInputStream. Now the input
	stream of OFile can be plugged into OConverter and the input stream
	of OConverter can be plugged into application (Fig 6.b).</DT><DT>
	Note that it is not necessary to change either application or OFile,
	only the plugging before the start of data transfer must be adapted.
	If desired, this may be decided at runtime.</DT>
	<DT>
	Note also, that you can easily insert more converters into the
	chain.
	</DT>
</DL>

<PRE>The following code samples show how plugging is done.
/// Plugging for Fig 6b (without error handling)
{
     Reference&lt;XInterface &gt; application;
     Reference&lt;XInterface &gt; OConverter;
     Reference&lt;XInterface &gt; OFile;

     // instantiate the three objects via services, put them into the above references
     .....

     // query the interfaces
     Reference&lt; XInputStream &gt; aFileInputStream( OFile , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XInputStream &gt; aConverterInputStream( OConverter , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataSink &gt; aConverterSink( OConverter , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataSink &gt; aApplicationSink( application , UNO_QUERY );

     // plug the connection
     aConverterSink.setInputStream( aFileInputStream );
     aApplicationSink.setInputStream( aConverterInputStream );

     // start data transfer
     ...
}
</PRE>

  <dl>
	<DT>
	The following figure shows the resulting calling sequence for a
	readBytes()-call for both cases.</DT><DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_read.gif" NAME="Rahmen7" ALT="Rahmen7" WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=260 BORDER=0/>
	<DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_read_and_convert.gif" NAME="Rahmen8" ALT="Rahmen8" WIDTH=570 HEIGHT=363 BORDER=0/>
	</DT>
	<DT>
	Note that the <B>order of plugging</B> may be significant if
	data transfer is started with the setInputStream method. Again the
	last line of the above sample code :</DT><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	a)
	</DT>
</DL>

<PRE>{
   // plug the connection
   aConverterSink.setInputStream( aFileInputStream );        // first connect passive parts.
   aApplicationSink.setInputStream( aConverterInputStream ); // active player is connected last,
                                                             // no problems can arise
}

b)
{
   // plug the connection
   aApplicationSink.setInputStream( aConverterInputStream ); // application starts to read but OConverter
   // is not connected to anything.
   aConverterSink.setInputStream( aFileInputStream );
}
</PRE>

<p>The problem can be avoided :</p>

<OL>
	<li> Use code sample a) instead of b) when plugging. ( Responsibility
	is left to the user ). When b) is used, OConverter will throw an
	exception.

	<li>OConverter can be designed, so that it can cope with the problem. If
	it is not connected to anything, but its read()-method is called, it
	could wait in a condition up to the moment when connection is
	established. Note that this is not an ideal solution, if the
	connection never gets established there remains a dead thread
	without any sign of an error. It also must be implemented again and
	again for each converter.

	<LI>Do not start the data transfer with these set-methods. Better
	use XActiveDataControl (see below)
</OL>

<DL>
	<DT>
	Note : It can be quite difficult to implement a OConverter, that
	modifies the number of bytes to read. The skipBytes(), readBytes()
	and available()-methods must always return the requested number of
	bytes, in such cases, converters must do at least some buffering on
	their own. For such applications it is in general easier to
	implement an output stream (and use pipes and threads to get the
	desired interface, see below). However this may be too expensive in
	some cases.</DT>
</DL>

<h3> 2.2.2 Piping </h3>

<DL>
	<DT>Motivation :</DT><DT>
	For a lot of applications it is necessary to have more than one
	active player in the game. Imagine you have a datasource that can
	only write actively and a datasink that can only read actively and
	you want to connect them. This can be done by a pipe. A pipe offers
	an OutputStream to write to and an InputStream to read from. Thus it
	must buffer the data that come in via XOutputStream.</DT>
	<DT>
	Fig. 9 shows a concrete example for a pipe. A file x is copied into
	file y. OFileReader reads file x in certain slices. Each slice is
	written via the output stream to OPipe. OFileWriter gets actively data
	from OPipe and writes it directly into file y. The connection is
	plugged with standard components (which still need to be
	implemented), they can be used in other scenarios independent of
	each other.</DT>
	<DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_piping.gif" NAME="Rahmen9" ALT="Rahmen9" BORDER=0/>
	</DT><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	The following source code shows how the above connection is
	established (for simplicity without error handling).</DT></DL>

<PRE>
{
     Reference&lt; XInterface &gt; OFileWriter, OPipe, OFileReader;

     // instantiate them via a standard service
     ....

     // get the interfaces
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataSink &gt; sink( OFileWriter, UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XOutputStream &gt; pipeOut( OPipe , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XInputStream &gt; pipeIn( OPipe , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataSource &gt; source( OFileReader , UNO_QUERY );

     // do the plugging
     sink.setInputStream( pipeIn );
     source.setOutputStream( pipeOut );
     // now work with the connection ( sink and source )
}
</PRE>

 <dl>
   <DT>
	Note : You can insert further filters and converters via chaining.
	For example you can insert an instances of OConverter (above example)
	between OFileWriter and OPipe.</DT>
	<DT>
	Note : A pipe can also be seen as a mechanism to transform an output
	stream into an input stream at the costs of the buffer resources.</DT>
	<DT>
	Note : By exchanging OFileWriter with an object that implements
	XActiveDataSink and XActiveDataSource, one could add a further
	pipe. This shows the flexibility of the concept.</DT>
	</DL>

<H4> The 3<SUP>rd</SUP> level : XActiveDataControl </H4>

<DL>
	<DT>The question 'when should data transfer start ?' is not solved
	sufficiently. One can say that as soon as the last connection has
	been plugged, the data starts to flow. That is not acceptable for
	some applications. An generic interface is needed, which can one use
	to initiate the data transfer. This is the role of
	XActiveDataControl.</DT>
	<DT>
	XActiveDataControl should be implemented with XActiveDataSink or
	XActiveDataSource, thus each active player in the game should
	implement it.</DT>
	<DT>
	XActiveDataControl offers a non-blocking start()-method to initiate
	data transfer. The terminate()-method should abort the data transfer
	before it is normally finished. Usually this should be done by
	calling the close()-method of the connected streams. See error
	handling for further information.</DT>

	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_datacontrol.gif" NAME="Rahmen10" ALT="Rahmen10" WIDTH=559 HEIGHT=229 BORDER=0/>
	</DT></DL>

<PRE>
To startup the above sample pipe, the following code is necessary :
{
     Reference&lt; XInterface &gt; OFileWriter, OPipe, OFileReader;

     // instantiate them via a standard service
     ....

     // get the interfaces for plugging
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataSink &gt; sink( OFileWriter, UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XOutputStream &gt; pipeOut( OPipe , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XInputStream &gt; pipeIn( OPipe , UNO_QUERY );
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataSource &gt; source( OFileReader , UNO_QUERY );

     // plug ( data transfer is not started )
     sink.setInputStream( pipeIn );
     source.setOutputStream( pipeOut );

     // get the interfaces for starting
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataControl &gt; controlSink( OFileWriter );
     Reference&lt; XActiveDataControl &gt; controlSource( OFileReader );

     // start
     controlSink.start();   // order of starting is not important, the whole connection already exists.
     controlSource.start(); // it may be less expensive to start sink first, because OPipe
                            // may need less resources for buffering.
}
</PRE>

<p>XActiveDataControl also offers a listener administration.</p>

<H4> The 4<SUP>th</SUP> level : XConnectable</H4>

<DL>
	<DT>The held references in Fig. 10 are unidirectional. There is no
	generic way to get from OFileWriter to OFileReader. This maybe
	interesting for further streaming administration services.</DT>
	<DT>
	Here now appears XConnectable on stage. Every class in the
	connection should implement XConnectable. Below (Fig.11 and Fig.
	12) you find the extended version of the above examples.</DT><DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_connected_chain.gif" NAME="Grafik2" WIDTH=669 HEIGHT=240 BORDER=0 alt="Stream connected chain"/><br clear=left/>
	<FONT SIZE=2><I>Fig
	11. Extended example (see fig. 6b). Each element in the connection
	implements XConnectable and connects to their neighbours. Thus it is
	possible to reach Application from OFile. The direction of the
	connection (successor/predecessor) is determined by the direction
	of dataflow.</I></FONT></DT><DT>

	<I>Fig
	12. Extended example (see fig 10). Now every element of the
	connection is reachable with one arbitrary element.</I></DT>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	The extra plugging work should not be left to the user. In order to
	get this working with the least effort for the user, the
	implementation of the XActiveDataSink.setInputStream() or
	XActiveDataSource2.setOutputStream() must be modified the following
	way:</DT></DL>
<PRE>
OFileWriter::setInputStream( const Reference&lt; XInputStream &gt; &amp;r )
{
     /// store the inputstream reference for later use
     m_in = r;

<p>Note that any object, which does not support this XConnectable mechanism will interrupt the connection.

<dl>
<DT style="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	The sense of XConnectable is maybe not very clear. Note that
	implementing this underlying connection of elements will allow to
	create standard services, that can help to establish and
	administrate connections of streams. This may be an important reason
	for using this new streaming interfaces, that's why you are strongly
	encouraged to implement them.
	</DT><DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	An use case may be a video stream, where the sink wants to change
	some settings at source, but the sink doesn't know the source. It
	can then use XConnectable to wander to the source, where it can
	query on a known interface.</DT></DL>

<H3> 2.5 Errorhandling </H3>

<DL>
	<DT>This chapter deals with abnormal conditions that may occur when
	using streams.</DT><DT>
	<IMG SRC="../images/stream_connected_pipe.gif" NAME="Grafik5" WIDTH=559 HEIGHT=259 BORDER=0 alt="Stream connected pipe"/>
	</DT><DT>
	Let's take the <B>pipe</B> example as a basis for discussion.</DT>
	<DT>
	In the normal case both FileReader and FileWriter start to do their
	job. When FileReader has read all data from the file x and has
	written all data into the outputstream, it must call closeOutput on
	XOutputStream. This will disconnect OPipe and OFileReader,
	OFileReader may be deleted. When OFileWriter tries to read beyond
	eof, it realizes that it gets less bytes than questioned. This is
	interpreted by OFileWriter as eof sign. It then calls closeInput on
	the XInputStream and frees its own resources. The reference between
	OPipe and OFileWriter is removed, OFileWriter and OPipe may be
	deleted.
	</DT>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Possible error scenarios are :</DT></DL>
<OL>
	<LI>
	Error during reading file x (OFileReader). In that case OFileReader
	closes its internal resources, broadcasts an error to all listeners
	and calls closeOutput() on outputstream. Note that OPipe and
	OFileWriter cannot distinguish between a normal eof-close and a
	error close (unless they are listeners).

	<LI>Error during writing file y
	(OFileWriter). In that case, OFileWriter closes its internal
	resources, broadcasts an error to all listeners and calls
	closeInput() (which will disconnect OFileWriter from OPipe ) on
	inputstream. OFileReader is still writing on OPipe's outputstream.
	At any time after the closeInput() call, OPipe may throw an
	IOException, if OFileReader calls a write-method. OFileReader
	catches the exception, calls closeOutput() on the outputstream,
	which will disconnect OPipe from OFileReader. It may also broadcast
	an error to all listeners.

	<LI>Error in OPipe (e.g. buffer full).
	At any time after the exceptional state has occurred, OPipe will
	throw exceptions for every read call and every write call.
	OFileReader and OFileWriter must then call
	closeInput()/closeOutput() and broadcast an error.

	<LI>terminate()-method on OFileReader or OFileWriter is called.
	This can be handled very similar to the above error conditions,
	except that the terminated()-handler must be called.
</OL>
<DL>
	<DT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">
	Note that all above errors in general occur in a multi-threaded
	environment. Especially situations as that the terminate()-method of
	OFileWriter gets called when another thread is in the read-Method of
	OPipe must be handled correctly. In this case, terminate must call
	closeInput(), OPipe must return out of the reading thread with
	eof-signature (less bytes read than questioned) and OFileWriter must
	call only the terminated() but not the error() handler!.</DT></DL>

<h2 id="standard_services"> Standard services </h2>

<p>The following standard services have been implemented . Implementations
can be found in udk/io/source/stm.
The dll is <B>stm.dll</B>.
All implementations are thread safe. However it is probably not very
meaningful, if two threads read the same input stream at the same
time which thread gets which data is then arbitrary.

<p>Note: All streams must be explicitly closed in order to free their resources
and release their ring references.</p>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.Pipe :</B>
implements <I>XOutputStream</I>, <I>XInputStream</I> and
<I>XConnectable</I></p>
<p>Basic implementation (see fig 12) to connect
input stream and output stream. In general one thread is writing data
into the pipe and another is reading from the pipe. The pipe does the
necessary buffering in memory.</P>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.DataInputStream
: </B>implements <I>XDataInputStream</I>, <I>XActiveDataSink</I> and
<I>XConnectable</I></p>
<p>Provides the XDataInputStream functionality.
Must be chained to another XInputStream (e.g. a pipe) to be
meaningful.</P>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.DataOutputStream</B>
: implements <I>XDataOutputStream</I>, <I>XActiveDataSource</I> and
<I>XConnectable</I></p>
<p>Provides the XDataOutputStream functionality.
Must be chained to another XOutputStream (e.g. a pipe) to be
meaningful.</P>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.MarkableInputStream
: </B>implements <I>XMarkableStream</I>, <I>XInputStream</I>,
<I>XActiveDataSink</I> and <I>XConnectable</I></p>
<p>Provides the
XMarkableStream functionality. When a mark is created, the
implementations buffers all further read data. Must be chained to
another inputstream to be meaningful.</P>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.MarkableOutputStream
: </B>implements <I>XMarkableStream</I>, <I>XOutputStream</I>,
<I>XActiveDataSource</I> and <I>XConnectable</I></p>
<p>Provides the
XMarkableStream functionality. When a mark is created, the
implementations buffers all further written data. The data is written
further through the chain, when the mark is deleted. Even a flush
will not have any effect. Must be chained to another outputstream to
be meaningful.</P>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.ObjectInputStream
: </B>implements <I>XObjectInputStream</I>, <I>XActiveDataSink</I>
and <I>XConnectable</I></p>
<p>Provides XObjectInputStream functionality.
All services of instances, that shall be read, must be registered
with the global service manager. All services must implement
XPersistObject. Must be chained to another XInputStream. Somewhere in
the chain <B>must</B> exist an XMarkableStream.
Be careful that all elements between this and XMarkableStream <B>must
not</B> buffer data ( otherwise the markable stream becomes
meaningless ) and one receives coincident results.</P>

<P><B>com.sun.star.uno.io.ObjectOutputStream</B>
: implements <I>XObjectOutputStream, XActiveDataSource</I> and
<I>XConnectable</i></p>
<p>Provides XObjectOutputStream functionality.
All services, that shall be serialized, must implement
<I>XPersistObject.</I> Must be chained to another XOutputStream.
Somewhere in the chain <B>must exist </B>a XMarkableStream. Be
careful that all elements between this and XMarkableStream <B>must
not </B>buffer data ( otherwise the markable stream becomes

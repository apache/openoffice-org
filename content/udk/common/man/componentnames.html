<H1>Naming Scheme</H1>

<P>UNO components that come in the form of a shared library (<CODE>.so</CODE> on
Linux and Solaris, <CODE>.dll</CODE> on Windows, <CODE>.dylib</CODE> on Mac)
should be named as
<PRE>
<VAR><CODE>NAME</CODE></VAR>[<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR>]<!--
  --><CODE>.uno.</CODE>(<CODE>so</CODE>|<CODE>dll</CODE>|<CODE>dylib</CODE>)
</PRE>
that is a descriptive <VAR><CODE>NAME</CODE></VAR>, followed by an optional
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR>, followed by the characters
&ldquo;<CODE>.uno</CODE>&rdquo; and the platform-specific extension
(&ldquo;<CODE>.so</CODE>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<CODE>.dll</CODE>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<CODE>.dylib</CODE>&rdquo;, etc.).  The optional
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> should be of the form
<PRE>
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR>  =  <VAR><CODE>MAJOR</CODE></VAR> <!--
  -->[<CODE>.</CODE><VAR><CODE>MINOR</CODE></VAR> <!--
  -->[<CODE>.</CODE><VAR><CODE>MICRO</CODE></VAR>]]
<VAR><CODE>MAJOR</CODE></VAR>  =  <VAR><CODE>NUMBER</CODE></VAR>
<VAR><CODE>MINOR</CODE></VAR>  =  <VAR><CODE>NUMBER</CODE></VAR>
<VAR><CODE>MICRO</CODE></VAR>  =  <VAR><CODE>NUMBER</CODE></VAR>
<VAR><CODE>NUMBER</CODE></VAR>  =  <CODE>0</CODE>  |  <!--
  --><CODE>1</CODE>&ndash;<CODE>9</CODE> <CODE>0</CODE>&ndash;<CODE>9</CODE>*
</PRE></P>

<P>How to use the <VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> scheme, if at all, to number
different versions of a given component shared library (e.g., only using the
<VAR><CODE>MAJOR</CODE></VAR> and increasing it whenever the code is changed, or
using all of <VAR><CODE>MAJOR</CODE></VAR>, <VAR><CODE>MINOR</CODE></VAR>, and
<VAR><CODE>MICRO</CODE></VAR>) is not specified here.</P>

<P>Examples of component shared library names are
<PRE>
<CODE>component.uno.so</CODE>
<CODE>component1.uno.dll</CODE>
<CODE>component0.1.3.uno.dylib</CODE>
</PRE></P>

<P>Rationale:  The <VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> is optional and is mainly
intended to be useful to humans (e.g., when communicating to others that a
certain <VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> of a component has a bug); see below for
some suggestions when it might be useful to use the optional
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> and when not.  The
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> is consistently placed before the
(platform-specific) extension, never after it; on Linux and Solaris, there is a
convention to add a version number after the &ldquo;<CODE>.so</CODE>&rdquo;, but
that version number has different semantics from the
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> number used here (in short, such a version
number changes whenever the shared library's interface changes, but that
interface of a component shared library&mdash;the few functions
<CODE>component_getFactory</CODE> etc.&mdash;never changes).</P>

<P>The &ldquo;<CODE>.uno</CODE>&rdquo; is placed next to the platform-specific
extension to emphasize that this is a special sort of shared library (its shared
library interface consists of only the few functions
<CODE>component_getFactory</CODE> etc., and the shared library has to be
registered with UNO to be useful).  As the given naming scheme is only a
suggestion, there might be violations of the rule where a component shared
library does not contain &ldquo;<CODE>.uno</CODE>&rdquo; in its name.
Therefore, no tool should build assumptions on whether a shared library name
contains &ldquo;<CODE>.uno</CODE>&rdquo; or not (e.g., when <CODE>pkgchk</CODE>
installs a <CODE>zip</CODE> file component, it should not simply register with
UNO all those contained shared libraries that contain
&ldquo;<CODE>.uno</CODE>&rdquo; in their names, but should rather use some other
mechanism like a manifest file explicitly listing all the contained shared
libraries that need to be registered).</P>

<P>For UNO components that are not shared libraries (e.g., a Java component
resulting in a <CODE>jar</CODE> file), it can also be useful to add
&ldquo;<CODE>.uno</CODE>&rdquo; (and the optional
<VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR>) to the component's name (e.g.,
<CODE>component.uno.jar</CODE>, or <CODE>component1.5.uno.jar</CODE>), for the
same reasons as for component shared libraries: to emphasize that it is a UNO
component.  Again, this is a suggestion, not a hard rule.</P>


<H1>Kinds of Components</H1>

<P>When deciding whether to add an optional <VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> to a
component shared library's name, it might be useful to consider the following
kinds of components:</P>

<UL>
    <LI>Those component shared libraries that are considered part of OOo (part
    of an OOo installation set, placed into the program directory during setup,
    and registered during setup).  Their versions are already well defined by
    the version of the installed OOo itself (as they are part of the OOo build).
    And because adding explicit version strings to such shared libraries might
    cause maintenance problems within the OOo build process (e.g., the
    <CODE>scp</CODE> projects refer to a shared library with its complete name,
    so this would have to be adapted whenever a component's
    <VAR><CODE>VERSION</CODE></VAR> changes), it might be best to leave the
    versioning out for this sort of component shared libraries.</LI>

    <LI>Those component shared libraries that are part of a larger component
    <CODE>zip</CODE> file (installed by <CODE>pkgchk</CODE>).  Here, any
    versioning can be put into the name of the <CODE>zip</CODE> file (e.g.,
    <CODE>component1.5.zip</CODE>); <CODE>pkgchk</CODE> will unpack the
    component shared library into a directory path from which the name of the
    <CODE>zip</CODE> file can be deduced, so a human can always track what
    version of the component <CODE>zip</CODE> file is in use.  So, in this case
    it might also be sensible to not use the versioning for the component shared
    libraries.</LI>

    <LI>Those component shared libraries that are not part of a larger component
    <CODE>zip</CODE> file, but are rather components made up of a single shared
    library (installed by <CODE>pkgchk</CODE>).  In this case, it might well
    make sense to use the versioning, so that a human can easily track what
    version of such a component got installed (e.g., to mention it in a bug
    report).</LI>
</UL>


<H1>Ways Components Can Evolve</H1>

<UL>
    <LI>A component shared library's interface (the few functions
    <CODE>component_getFactory</CODE> etc.) is assumed to be stable.</LI>

    <LI>A component's service interface (i.e., the UNO services offered by a
    component) can change:
    <UL>
        <LI>compatibly, by adding a new implementation name, or by adding a new
        UNO service name to an implementation name;</LI>

        <LI>incompatibly, by removing an implementation name, or by removing a
        UNO service name from an implementation name;</LI>

        <LI>indirectly compatibly, when one of the named UNO services changes
        compatibly (by adding additional optional interfaces to it).
        <STRONG>[TODO: Adding optional interfaces to a service is probably
        <EM>not</EM> a compatible change, see the mail &ldquo;Extending
        Published Services with Optional Interfaces Considered Harmful&rdquo;
        from August 14, 2003 at
        <CODE>dev@udk.openoffice.org</CODE>.]</STRONG></LI>
    </UL></LI>

    <LI>A component shared library's implementation itself can change (bug
    fixes).  Such changes will typically be compatible, unless a known bug is
    fixed on whose observable behavior clients of the component depend (which,
    in effect, considered the bug a feature instead).</LI>

    <LI>A component shared library can change its dependencies on other shared 
    libraries (C/C++ runtime libraries like <CODE>libc.so.6</CODE>,
    <CODE>libstdc++.so.3.0.1</CODE>, and <CODE>libstlport_gcc.so</CODE>; UNO
    runtime libraries like <CODE>libcppu.so.3.1.0</CODE> and
    <CODE>libcppuhelpergcc3.so.3.1.0</CODE>; OOo libraries like
    <CODE>libsvx644li.so</CODE>).  These changes are typically incompatible, as
    they rely on (compatible or incompatible) changes of the component's
    environment.</LI>

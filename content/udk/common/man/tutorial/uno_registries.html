<h2 id="Overview"> Overview </h2>
<p>This document provides information about meaning and usage of UNO-registries
within arbitrary UNO processes.

<p>
UNO-registries store binary data in a tree-like structure. It has nothing to do
with the windows registry (except that they follow a similar concept). UNO-registries mainly
store two types of data

<ol>
<li> Type-library<br/>
     In order to be able to invoke UNO-calls from BASIC or invoke UNO-calls via a
     interprocess-connection, the core UNO bridges need information about the used datatypes.
     <p>UNO has chosen to store these information into a typelibrary, so that the same
     data is reusable from any bridge. This is in opposite to for instance the CORBA approach,
     where for every datatype C-code is generated which needs to be compiled and linked into
     huge libraries.
<li> Information about registered components<br/>
     One basic concept of UNO is to simply be able to create an instance of a service by name
     via a so called ServiceManager.
     The association between the service name and the shared-library (where the necessary
     compiled code is to be found) is stored into a UNO-registry.
</ol>

<p>Both types of data are <strong>absolutely necessary to run a UNO-C++
process</strong>. Lack of the
one or the other information generally leads to fast termination or crash of the program,
so please avoid this. UNO processes in general open there registries during startup and
close them when the process terminates.

<p>
Both types of data are in general stored into a file with a <em>.rdb</em>-suffix (
<strong>r</strong>egistry <strong>d</strong>ata<strong>b</strong>ase ).

<p> This documents explains more details about the two types of data, explains the
tools how to prepare a proper registry and the different possibilities about how to
bootstrap a C++ process with a registry. Another chapter deals with the registries used
in OpenOffice.org.

<h2 id="view"> Viewing registries </h2>

<h3> UNO typelibrary</h3>

To be useable by a UNO C++ process, all type descriptions must be available within the registry
under the /UCR main key (UCR = <strong>U</strong>no <strong>C</strong>ore <strong>R</strong>eflection).

You can have a look at the file office-install/program/applicat.rdb using the regview tool, which
comes with the office development kit.


For instance <br/>
<p>
<code>
$ regview applicat.rdb /UCR
</code> <br/>
<p>
dumps all type descriptions used within the office to stdout. One can check if a certain type
is included within the registry by invoking the following command

<pre>
$ regview applicat.rdb /UCR/com/sun/star/bridge/XUnoUrlResolver

/UCR/com/sun/star/bridge/XUnoUrlResolver
 Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_BINARY
        Size = 461
        Data = minor version: 0
               major version: 1
               type: 'interface'
               uik: { 0x00000000-0x0000-0x0000-0x00000000-0x00000000 }
               name: 'com/sun/star/bridge/XUnoUrlResolver'
               super name: 'com/sun/star/uno/XInterface'
               Doku: ""
               IDL source file: "O:\UDK303\src\udkapi\com\sun\star\bridge\XUnoUrlResolver.idl"
               number of fields: 0
               number of methods: 1
               method #0: com/sun/star/uno/XInterface resolve([in] string sUnoUrl)
	           raises com/sun/star/connection/NoConnectException,
		          com/sun/star/connection/ConnectionSetupException,
			  com/sun/star/lang/IllegalArgumentException
	       Doku: ""
               number of references: 0
</pre>
<p>
The regview-tool knows the format of the binary blob containing the typedescription and
dumps it in a human readable form.


<h3>Registered services</h3>
Only the UNO component itself provides the data about its implementations.
To save loading each available UNO component into memory when starting a UNO
process,
the data is assembled once (e.g. during setup) and stored into a registry. This process
is called <em>component registration</em>. Tools for performing this task are discussed below.

<p>For an installed OpenOffice.org, the applicat.rdb contains the registry information. The data
is stored within the /IMPLEMENTATIONS and /SERVICES key. Below you can find a sample
SERVICES key for the <code>com.sun.star.io.Pipe</code>-service.

<pre>
$ regview applicat.rdb /SERVICES/com.sun.star.io.Pipe

/SERVICES/com.sun.star.io.Pipe
 Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_STRINGLIST
        Size = 38
        Len  = 1
        Data = 0 = "com.sun.star.comp.io.stm.Pipe"
</pre>

<p>
It just contains one <em>implementation name</em> (it may contain more than one, but in
general only the first is used). Within the IMPLEMENTATIONS section, you can find the following
entry :

<pre>
$ regview applicat.rdb /IMPLEMENTATIONS/com.sun.star.comp.io.stm.Pipe

/IMPLEMENTATIONS/com.sun.star.comp.io.stm.Pipe
 / UNO
   / ACTIVATOR
     Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_STRING
            Size = 34
            Data = "com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary"

   / SERVICES
     / com.sun.star.io.Pipe
   / LOCATION
     Value: Type = RG_VALUETYPE_STRING
            Size = 8
            Data = "stm.dll"
</pre>

<p>
The implementations section holds three types of data.
<ol>
<li> The loader to be used when the component is requested at runtime (here
<code>com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary</code>).
<li> The services, which are supported by this implementation.
<li> The URL to the file, which the loader uses to access the library (the URL
may be given relative as it is in this case).
</ol>

<h2 id="tools"> Command line registry tools </h2>

<p>There are various tools to create, modify and use registries. The command
line options are discussed in detail <a href="../tools.html">here</a>. This
chapter shows some common use cases.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>The <strong>regmerge</strong> tool is used to merge multiple registries into
a subkey of an existing or new registry. For instance

<ol>
<li>
<pre>
$ regmerge new.rdb / test1.rdb test2.rdb
</pre>

<p> merges the contents of test1.rdb and test2.rdb into the file new.rdb. The names of the
keys are preserved, because both registries are merged into the root-key. In case new.rdb
existed before, the previous contents remain in new.rdb unless there exist identical keynames
in either test1.rdb and test2.rdb. In this case, the content of these keys is overwritten with
the ones in test1.rdb or test2.rdb. So the above command is semantically identical to

<pre>
$ regmerge new.rdb / test1.rdb
$ regmerge new.rdb / test2.rdb
</pre>


<li><pre>
$ regmerge myapp_types.rdb /UCR test1.urd test2.urd
</pre>
<p>
merges the contents of test1.urd and test2.urd into the file myapp_types.rdb. The names of the
keys in test1.urd and test2.urd get a /UCR prepended. ( The files produced by the idl-compiler
have a .urd-suffix. The regmerge tool needs to be run before the typelibrary can be used in a
program, because the /UCR key must be prepended ).
</ol>

<h3 id="registration"> Component registration</h3>
<p>
Components can be registered using the <a href="../tools.html#regcomp">regcomp</a>-tool.
In the example below the components necessary to establish an interprocess
connection (e.g. to a running
OpenOffice.org) get registered into the myapp_services.rdb.

<pre>
$ regcomp -register -r myapp_services.rdb \
                    -c uuresolver.dll     \
                    -c brdgfctr.dll       \
                    -c acceptor.dll       \
                    -c connectr.dll       \
		    -c remotebridge.dll
</pre>
(\ means here command line continuation).
<p>The option -r gives the registry, where the information shall be written to.
If it doesn't exist, it is created, otherwise the new data is added (in case
there are older keys, they get overwritten). The option -c can be given multiple
times, it is followed by a single library name, that shall be registered.

<p>
Registering a <strong>java-component</strong> is currently more complicated (we are
working on improving the process). It works only in a installed office environment
(office-install/program must be your current working directory),
the office setup must point to a valid java installation (you may start jvmsetup from
the office/program directory to verify this), and java must be enabled (see
Extras/Options/General/Security). On Windows, you MUST copy the regcomp.exe into
the office/program directory.

<pre>
$ regcomp -register -br applicat.rdb \
                    -l com.sun.star.loader.Java2 \
                    -r applict.rdb \
                    -c file:///i:/o641d3pro/program/JavaTestComponent.jar 
</pre>
<p>
The -br option is used to give the regcomp-tool a registry to work on, because the regcomp-tool
doesn't know, in which library the java-loader is to be found. The -l option gives the
service name of the loader to use for the component (it must be com.sun.star.loader.Java2 ).
The option can be omitted for C++ components, because regcomp defaults to the
com.sun.star.loader.SharedLibrary loader. The option -c gives the (MANDATORY ABSOLUTE) file URL to the
java component.

<h3>UNO typelibrary</h3>
<p>There are several tools, that currently access the typelibrary directly, they are mainly
used during building. 

<ul>
<li> <a href="../tools.html#idlc">idlc</a><br/>
   Compiles .idl into .urd-registry-files.
<li> <a href="../tools.html#cppumaker">cppumaker</a><br/>
   Generates C++ header for a given UNO typelist.
<li> <a href="../tools.html#cunomaker">cunomaker</a><br/>
   Generates C for a given UNO typelist.
<li> <a href="../tools.html#javamaker">javamaker</a><br/>
   Generates java-files for a given typelist.
<li> <a href="../tools.html#rdbmaker">rdbmaker</a><br/>
   Create a new registry by extracting given types (including dependent types) from
   another registry.
<li> regcompare<br/>
   Compares a typelibrary to a reference typelibrary and checks for compatibility.
</ul>

<h2 id="office"> Adding components to the office </h2>

<p>StarOffice 6.0 (or OpenOffice.org 1.0) uses 2 registries, the applicat.rdb (which can be found
at office-install/program/applicat.rdb) and the user60.rdb (which can be found in the home
directory on Unix and within the application data directory of your personal windows profile).

<p>
The applicat.rdb contains all types which are used by the office. During setup, all
chosen components get registered also into the applicat.rdb.

<p> The user-specific user60.rdb is opened for write access and is by default empty.

<h3>How to add a component to an office installation ?</h3>
A component may bring along new types and new component registration information.
There are multiple ways how
to integrate a new component into the office (with different advantages/disadvantages) :

<ol>
<li> merge new types into the applicat.rdb and register the component into the applicat.rdb
<p>
Merged types can't be removed anymore. It offers maximal startup performance, as there
is only one registry. In a network installation, the component is available for EVERY user.
This may lead to problems in a network installation, in case there are running offices
using the applicat.rdb during the merge process. This should be avoided.

<li> put the new types and component registration information registry into a separate file
somewhere in the file system and modify the bootstrap variables.

<p> The new component can then be easily removed later on (by changing the bootstrap
variables to there original values). It
maybe a little slower during startup (as type lookups are now performed over two registries).
No matter how the bootstrap variables are modified (see below), it is safe to do it in a network
installation also with running user-offices. 

<p> There are multiple ways to modify the bootstrap variables (see therefor the 
<a href="../concept/uno_default_bootstrapping.html">
UNO bootstrapping document</a>). Here are only two suggestions.
<ul>
<li> modify the uno.ini
<p>after installation, the uno.ini contains the following lines
<pre>
[Bootstrap]
UNO_TYPES=$SYSBINDIR/applicat.rdb
UNO_SERVICES=$SYSBINDIR/applicat.rdb
</pre>
Please change this to something like
<pre>
[Bootstrap]
UNO_TYPES=$SYSBINDIR/applicat.rdb $SYSBINDIR/mycomponent_types.rdb
UNO_SERVICES=$SYSBINDIR/applicat.rdb $SYSBINDIR/mycomponent_services.rdb
</pre>
The new component then gets available as soon as the offices get restarted (note
that also the quickstarter needs to be terminated to really terminate the office process !).

<li> pass the new values for the bootstrap variables via the command line
<p> e.g.<br/>
<pre>
soffice "-env:UNO_TYPES=$SYSBINDIR/applicat.rdb file:///path/to/local/mycomponent_types.rdb" \
 "-env:UNO_SERVICES=$SYSBINDIR/applicat.rdb file:///path/to/local/mycomponent_services.rdb" 
</pre>
Here only this office is started with the new component enabled (make sure, the office
really has terminated before !!). 

</ul>
<li> register the new component via StarBasic.
<p>In the ODK examples can be found a BASIC library called regcomp, which can simply be imported
into the office via Tools/Macro/Organizer/Libraries/Append. Starting the first basic macro from
this library opens a dialog which allows to select a component to be registered. (This is a
very new feature, it may not yet be within your version of the ODK).

<p>In this case, registration data will be written into the user60.rdb and is therefor available
only for the current office-user. The component is useable directly after registration. You
currently cannot add new types via this method, in case your component needs this, you need to do
it in one of the ways described above.

</ol>

<h2 id="bootstrap"> Bootstrapping arbitrary UNO C++ processes </h2>

<p>There are many ways to bootstrap an UNO C++ application (probably too many). For every way
you need to properly prepare one or multiple registry files.

<h3>Preparing registries</h3>
In general you should have different files for registered components and typelibraries.
There are multiple reasons therefor
<ul>
<li> Typelibraries and component registration data are very different kind of data and are
     used from different core components ( servicemanager and registrytypeprovider ).
<li> Often typelibraries are more static than component registration registries, meaning
that during development phases, the types are often fixed while libraries are changed or
added. Therefor typelibraries in general need less frequent updates.
<li> In order to write into a registry, you need exclusive access. No other process may
read or write from this registry during this time.
<li> Often two different applications may share the type registry but have different
component registries.
</ul>

So no matter which of the below bootstrapmethods you choose, you should prepare two registries,
one which contains the types and the other one which contains the registered components. The
type registry should be the applicat.rdb found in the ODK plus additional self defined types
(in fact you may not need all types from the applicat.rdb, in case you are
looking for a minimal solution, you can use the rdbmaker tool to reduce the
types to an absolute minimum).
<!-- The service-registry should be (unfinished thought) -->

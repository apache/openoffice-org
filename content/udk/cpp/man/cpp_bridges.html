<h2><a name="objective"></a> Objective </h2>

<p>This document is written for developers implementing a bridge from C++ to
binary UNO. The last paragraph covers the
<a href="#msci">Microsoft Visual C++ - UNO bridge</a> in detail.</p>

<h2><a name="terminology"></a> Terminology </h2>

<ul>
    <li><i>Environment</i><br/>
        <p>An environment is specific to a programming language/ the compiler in 
        which interfaces are implemented, e.g. the name &quot;msci&quot; for 
        a C++ environment using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. It can also 
        be session specific for some reasons, e.g. when running multiple JVM 
        (Java virtual machines) in one process.</p>
         
    <li> <i>Mapping</i><br/>
		<p>A mapping is the directed way to publish an interface into another
		environment, i.e. you map an interface from a source environment to a
		target environment.  So you can invoke methods on a mapped interface
		(relating to the target environment) which are delegated to the
		originating interface in the source environment. The delegation/
		invocation is performed by the <i>bridge</i>.  A mapped interface is
		called a <i>proxy</i>.</p>

    <li><i>Bridge</i><br/>
		<p>A bridge denotes the infrastructure to exchange interfaces between 
        two environments and is bidirectional, supporting a mapping for each 
        direction.</p>

		<p>Example: The language binding Visual C++/UNO supports two mappings
		to exchange interfaces from the environment "Visual C++" to the 
        UNO environment and vice versa.</p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="loading"></a> Loading a bridge </h2>

<P>Each bridge is implemented in a separate shared library loaded by the UNO
runtime. The naming scheme of the library is a concatenation with the
following:</p>

<p>[<i>purpose_</i>]<i>SourceEnvName_DestEnvName</i></p>

<p>The optional purpose denotes the purpose of the bridge, e.g. protocol 
traffic between two environments. If no purpose is given, then the bridge 
just maps interfaces from source to destination environment.</p>

<p>Windows examples: prot_uno_uno.dll, msci_uno.dll<br/>
  Solaris examples: libprot_uno_uno.so, libsunpro5_uno.so</p>
<p>The bridge library exports two functions called
<code>uno_ext_getMapping()</code> and <code>uno_initEnvironment()</code>.  The
latter is currently implemented by the bridge library for pragmatic reasons.
The runtime will lookup an initialization library of an environment by loading
a library with name <i>EnvName</i>_uno. <code>uno_getEnvironment()</code>
initializes the environment, e.g. raises the JVM, sets a disposing callback
etc. C++ environments usually do nothing.</p>

<pre>void SAL_CALL uno_initEnvironment(
    uno_Environment * pEnv ); </pre>

<p>The first function, <code>uno_ext_getMapping()</code>, is called by the UNO
runtime to get the mappings for both directions. The
<code>uno_ext_getMapping()</code> call receives a source and destination
environment handle to distinguish which mapping is demanded. It is quite clear
that the bridge library cannot be unloaded while any code of it is still
needed, i.e. interfaces are held.  So both mappings and any wrapped interface
(proxy) that is exported needs to modify a shared library wide reference
count.</p>

<pre>
void SAL_CALL uno_ext_getMapping(
    uno_Mapping ** ppMapping,
    uno_Environment * pFrom, uno_Environment * pTo );
</pre>

<h2><a name="env"></a> Environment </h2>

<P>The intention of an environment (and programmatically 
environment handles) is to identify (given by its type name and context 
pointer) and optionally to provide extra functionality like interface 
registration.</p>

<p>In specific the latter point is very important, because of the object 
identity of an interface. Any UNO object is defined to provide the <u>same</u> 
instance of XInterface any time it is queried for it. This specification 
has been made to test whether two interfaces belong to the same object 
(e.g. when testing the source object of an incoming event). So 
when interfaces are mapped around to some environments outer space, they 
must provide the <u>same</u> XInterface in each environment (e.g. in C++, 
equal XInterface pointers).</p>

<p>Also it is recommended to reuse any interface you can, i.e. reducing the 
construction of proxy interfaces as often as you can, because each constructed 
proxy interface leads among the acquisition of resources to another indirection 
when called.</p>

<p>The structure of an environment is split into 
the simple common &quot;identity&quot; part which can easily be implemented 
by bridges that handle object identity issues in their own way. If the 
environment implementation supports interface registration functionality 
etc. then the optional pointer is set. Optional functionality is interface 
registration, acquiring/ releasing interfaces of the environment and obtaining 
object identifiers for an interface.</p>

<p>Interface registration is divided into registration of proxy and original 
interfaces. Obviously proxies have to be held unacquired, otherwise mapped 
interfaces will never die. The rule for a reference counted C++ proxy 
is, that it registers itself when reference count increments from 0 to 
1 and revokes itself when the count decrements from 1 
to 0. To synchronize registration access while not granting internal locks 
on the interface registration, the proxy will be explicitly freed by the 
environment by its given freeProxy() function at registration.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between registered environments 
and anonymous environments. You can obtain an existing environment by 
calling <code>uno_getEnvironment()</code>. 
If there is no existing one, then <code>uno_getEnvironment()</code> 
creates and registers a default one providing the additional functionality 
(interface registration etc.). This is the common way.</p>

<p>In contrast to this you can call <code>uno_createEnvironent()</code> 
to create an anonymous environment giving an environment's type name
(e.g. &quot;msci&quot;) and a context pointer. Creating anonymous environments 
is sensible if you need more than one environment of the same type. 
You may want to protocol any calls from/ to your component and one
possibility is the following approach:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create an anonymous environment of type &quot;uno&quot;.</li>

	<li>Connect the registered uno environment and the anonymous environment via
	    the protocol bridge &quot;prot_uno_uno&quot;.</li>

	<li>Connect the anonymous UNO environment with the environment of your
		component using the C++ bridge of choice (compiler that compiled the
		component code).</li>

	<li>Connect your launching environment (the environment from within calls
	    are put) with the registered uno environment.</li>

	<li>Launch your component.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="mapping"></a> Mapping </h2>

<p>A bridge consists of two mappings. Each mapping is dependent 
on its counterpart mapping, because performing a call may bring up the 
need to convert interfaces from one environment to the other (e.g., in 
parameter interface) and vice versa (e.g., return values).</p>

<p>Mapping an interface from environment A to environment B involves several 
steps to keep track of object identities:</p>

<ol>
    <li>First the object identifier of an interface is determined by calling 
        getObjectIdentifier() of environment A (source environment).
    <li>Then the destination environment is asked with the object identifier 
        and type, if there is a already a registered interface in use. If this 
        is the case you can use that one and end up here.
    <li>If there is no such interface in use, the bridge will 
        produce a proxy of that type delegating all calls to the given source 
        interface of environment A.
    <li>The source interface will be registered at environment 
        A and the proxy interface will be introduced as a new proxy at environment 
        B (registerProxyInterface()).
</ol>

<p>The whole scenario is shown in the
<a href="images/mapping_scenario.jpg"> big picture</a>.</p>

<h2> Microsoft Visual C++ - UNO bridge</h2>

<p>This is a short, source code based description of an UNO bridge
implementation for C++ objects compiled with the Microsoft Visual C++ 4-6.  It
covers the rudimentary calling stuff which is very similar to other compilers
but omits exception handling.</p>

<p><b>Mapping</b></p>

<p>Mapping an interface from one environment to another is transparently done 
via the right mapping, e.g. like the following XFoo interface from UNO to 
the Microsoft Visual C++ environment:</p>

<pre>
Mapping aMapping( "uno", "msci" );
XFoo * pFoo = (XFoo *)aMapping.mapInterface(
    pUnoFoo, ::getCppuType( (const Reference< XFoo > *)0 ) );
...
pFoo->bar();
...
pFoo->release();
</pre>

<p>The given UNO interface is mapped to the Microsoft 
world transparently, so you can call methods and catch exceptions as if 
the calls are performed on an &quot;original&quot; Visual C++ object.</p>

<p>To claim this goal, the underlying bridge has to emulate the behaviour 
and keep the correct object layout of its compiler. This example explains 
the bridge from the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler to the binary (C-) UNO
specification which is system dependent, but not compiler dependent. You can
communicate with UNO objects compiled with another compiler just by having 
an appropriate bridge to UNO.</p>

<p><b>C++ Proxy</b></p>

<p>Under the hood the call <code>bar()</code> that is performed on the mapped
interface will call on a proxy C++ object that delegates the call to its
corresponding UNO interface (the one given to <code>mapInterface()</code>).  To
create a C++ proxy, there is already a proxy class you can modify for your
needs (header file
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/source/browse/udk/bridges/inc/cpp_uno/bridge.h">bridges/inc/cpp_uno/bridge.h</a>).
You usually instantiate this class and modify the vtable pointer, giving your
generic vtable. For Microsoft Visual C++ you can use a generic one, because the
objects' this pointer is anytime the second stack parameter. On gcc or sunpro5
the first parameter may be the pointer to a struct return space.  So for those
compilers you have to generated a vtable for each type that is used.</p>

<p>When the proxy interface is called, the vtable index is determined
by the generic vtable and based on this, the method type description.
This is the information to get the values from the processor 
call stack and perform a dispatch call on the target UNO interface 
that the C++ proxy is wrapping.</p>

<p>After the dispatch call has been done, the returned exception information 
is checked whether a C++ exception has to be generated and raised.
If no exception has occurred, the inout/ out parameters have to be 
reconverted (which is only important for values representing interfaces 
or values containing interfaces though, because all UNO values are 
binary compatible on a specific computing architecture).</p>

<p>The C++ proxy object holds the interface origin (i.e. the target uno
interface) so it can register itself at the environment on its first acquire()
and revoke itself on its last release() from its environment.</p>

<pre>
struct cppu_cppInterfaceProxy : public ::com::sun::star::uno::XInterface
{
    oslInterlockedCount                  nRef;
    cppu_Bridge *                        pBridge;
    
    // mapping information
    uno_Interface *                      pUnoI; // wrapped interface
    typelib_InterfaceTypeDescription *   pTypeDescr;
    ::rtl::OUString                      oid;
    
    // non virtual methods called on incoming vtable calls #1, #2
    inline void SAL_CALL acquireProxy();
    inline void SAL_CALL releaseProxy();
    
    // XInterface: these are only here for dummy, there will be a patched vtable!
    virtual ::com::sun::star::uno::Any SAL_CALL queryInterface(
        const ::com::sun::star::uno::Type &amp; )
        { return ::com::sun::star::uno::Any(); } // don't use this, use cppu_queryInterface()!
    virtual void SAL_CALL acquire() {} // don't use this, use cppu_acquire()!
    virtual void SAL_CALL release() {} // don't use this, use cppu_release()!
    
    // ctor
    inline cppu_cppInterfaceProxy( cppu_Bridge * pBridge_,
                                   uno_Interface * pUnoI_,
                                   typelib_InterfaceTypeDescription * pTypeDescr_,
                                   const ::rtl::OUString &amp; rOId_ );
};
</pre>

<p>The proxy manages its reference count, a pointer to its bridge to get the
counterpart mapping, the uno interface it delegates calls to, the (interface)
type it is emulating and an object identifier (oid).</p>

<p>The type and object identifier are needed to manage objects from several
environments and prove for object identity and to improve performance (no new
interface is needed if there is already a registered interface in the
environment).</p>

<p>Essentially if a proxy object is created by the Visual C++ compiler, its
vtable is patched, which is the very first pointer in the object layout:</p>

<pre>
void SAL_CALL cppu_cppInterfaceProxy_patchVtable(
    XInterface * pCppI, typelib_InterfaceTypeDescription * pTypeDescr )
{
    static MediateVtables * s_pMediateVtables = 0;
    if (! s_pMediateVtables)
    {
        MutexGuard aGuard( Mutex::getGlobalMutex() );
        if (! s_pMediateVtables)
        {
            static MediateVtables s_aMediateVtables;
            s_pMediateVtables = &amp;s_aMediateVtables;
        }
    }
    // nMapFunctionIndexToMemberIndex: minimum size of demanded vtable
    *(const void **)pCppI = s_pMediateVtables->getMediateVtable(
        pTypeDescr->nMapFunctionIndexToMemberIndex );
}
</pre>

<p>The call stack of a virtual function call looks like this:</p>

<table width=50% border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 summary="Virtual call stack">
        <col width=1*/> <col width=1*/> <thead>

<p>The <code>cpp2uno_call()</code> function reads C++ parameters from the call
stack and converts to binary (C-) UNO, if needed (C++ and UNO values are binary
compatible concerning the memory layout).  If the UNO dispatch call has
returned and no exception has been signalled (<code>pUnoExc</code>), all out
parameters are written back to C++.</p>

<p><b>UNO Stub</b></p>

<p>If a Visual C++ interface is be mapped to binary UNO (i.e. the intermediate
environment), and that interface is mapped to another compiler environment,
then an UNO stub is created , delegating all UNO dispatch calls to its
corresponding C++ interface (in this case Microsoft Visual C++).</p>

<p>Incoming calls on the UNO interface (i.e. calls of the dispatch function)
are performed by converting the call parameters and pushing them on the
processor stack, then calling the demanded vtable slot on the destination
interface.<br/> Any C++ exception is caught and reported as an out parameter to
the caller. If no exception occurred, inout/ out parameters are converted and
written.</p>

<p>The UNO stub implementation is referred as the
<code>cppu_unoInterfaceProxy</code> class, because it functions as an UNO proxy
of a C++ interface:</p>

<pre>
struct cppu_unoInterfaceProxy : public uno_Interface
{
    oslInterlockedCount                    nRef;
    cppu_Bridge *                          pBridge;
    
    // mapping information
    ::com::sun::star::uno::XInterface *    pCppI; // wrapped interface
    typelib_InterfaceTypeDescription *     pTypeDescr;
    ::rtl::OUString                        oid;
    
    // ctor
    inline cppu_unoInterfaceProxy( cppu_Bridge * pBridge_,
                                   ::com::sun::star::uno::XInterface * pCppI_,
                                   typelib_InterfaceTypeDescription * pTypeDescr_,
                                   const ::rtl::OUString &amp; rOId_ );
};
</pre>
	
<p>The UNO stub manages its reference count, a pointer to its bridge to access
its counterpart mapping, the C++ interface it delegates incoming dispatch calls
to, the (interface) type it is emulating and an object identifier (oid).</p>

<p>The dispatch function <code>uno_Interface::pDispatcher()</code>
distinguishes between attribute read/ write access and method calls from the
UNO perspective, calling the correct C++ virtual function:</p>

</TABLE>

<P>This document describes a solution for automatically provided
stack traces for arbitrary UNO exceptions in C++ UNO environments.
These stack traces can be used to determine the code that actually
threw the exception.</P>

<H2>Motivation</H2>

<P>When debugging Offices exiting due to <I>unexpected</I> exceptions
it is often difficult to find the particular source line that has
thrown the exception. A solution for this problem could be to provide
a way to obtain a stack trace for each (UNO) exception thrown.
Ideally, the stack trace points exactly to the source line that has
thrown the exception. 
</P>

<P>This feature is certainly a good debugging tool, not only for the
scenario described above.</P>

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

<P>According to the Platform Technology Team it is possible to
provide a helper function that generates a stack trace for the
current thread for all of our supported platforms. The actual content
of the generated stack trace depends on the compiler and linker
options used to produce the binaries. It may contain very precise
information like function names including line numbers or just
function addresses.</P>

<P>Additionally, performance might become a problem. Generating a
stack trace can take up to several seconds, depending on the concrete
platform and again, compiler and linker settings used to build the
binaries. Further investigation and measurements must be done by the 
Platform Technology Team.</P>

<H2>Requirements</H2>

<OL>
	<LI>It shall be possible to automatically create stack traces for
	every UNO exception created and thrown.
	<LI>Solution should be compatible with UNO3.
</OL>

<H2>Possible Solutions</H2>

<P>Cppumaker generates the C++ class com::sun::star::uno::Exception
for exception com.sun.star.uno.Exception declared in IDL. Generally,
it is a good approach to add a new member to class
css::uno::Exception for holding the stack traces. This is fine, but
we have the requirement to stay compatible with UNO3. Therefore we
are not allowed to add another member to css::uno::Exception.</P>

<P>Luckily, css::uno::Exception already has a member <I>rtl::OUString
Message</I>, which is supposed to
transport user supplied messages. The idea is to reuse this member
for stack traces. This solution is compatible with UNO3. On the other
hand we have to ensure that user messages will not get lost.
Therefore the stack traces will simply be appended to the user
message.</P>

<P>Note: 'Message' is a public member of  class 
com::sun::star::uno::Exception. Thus its content can be overridden by
everyone at any time.</P>

<P>To summarize, introducing a new member for holding stack traces is
a clean solution and should be done for a successor of of UNO3 which
can become incompatible. For a quick solution that is compatible with
UNO3 we can reuse the existing 'Message' member.</P>

<H2>Details</H2>

<H3 CLASS="western">IDL Type Changes</H3>
<P>For UNO4, a new member <I>StackTrace</I>
must be added to com.sun.star.uno.Exception IDL specification.
Defining the member in IDL rather as an implementation detail
of the UNO C++ language binding has the benefit that the stack traces
can be inspected even over (remote) UNO bridges.</P>

<P>For the UNO3 solution, there are no IDL type changes necessary.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">When to generate stack traces?</H3>
<P>cppumaker must generate special code for class 
com::sun::star::uno::Exception. This includes generation of  the code
that automatically generates and fills in the stack traces.</P>

<P>Due to the possible performance problems with stack trace
generation there should be a flexible mechanism for configuring this
feature. There can be different strategies:</P>

			<td> Control stack trace generation via
				environment variable &ndash; default (var not present): default:
				OFF 
			</TD>
			<td> - performance problems </td>
		</TR>
	</TBODY>
</TABLE>

<P>The most flexible way is certainly to
provide an environment variable. The default behavior depends on the
actually performance problems. Further investigations are necessary
for defining this.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Where to generate stack traces?</H3>

<P>Code for generating a stack trace must
be added to <B>every constructor</B> of class
com::sun::star::uno::Exception, including the copy constructor.</P>

<P>The original idea that it is
sufficient to add stack generating code to the copy constructor only
turned out to be false. The assumption made was that the copy
constructor will always be called when throwing an exception before
leaving the current scope. But the compiler is allowed to optimize
here and to omit the copy construction. A test on Windows using
MSVC603 (compiler version  12.00.8168)  confirmed this. The following
code does <B>not</B> call the copy constructor of class MyException.</P>

<PRE>
class MyException
{
    ...
};

{
    ...

    // MyException copy ctor not called
    try
    {
        throw MyException();
    }
    catch ( MyException const &amp; )
    {
    }
}
</PRE>

<P>In an ideal solution one would expect
exactly one stack trace per thrown exception. The stack trace should
point to the throwing function (or even better to the line number of
the throwing statement). This goal is hardly to achieve without
multiplying efforts. Reasons for this:</P>

<OL>
	<li><p>At a given time, there can exist
	multiple valid stack traces for one exception object. That means,
	the exception is thrown more than once. Examples:</P>

	<OL>
		<LI>One exception object may be
		thrown by different threads at the same time. Each throw has its
		own stack trace.

		<LI>One exception may be 'active'
		multiple times, even in one thread. Note that even in this case the
		MSVC603 compiler does not call the MyException copy constructor.
		Therefore there will be no stack trace generated for the rethrow in
		the outer catch handler of <I>main.</I>
	</OL>
</OL>

<PRE>
class MyException
{
    ...
};

class MySpecializedException1 : public MyException
{
    ...
};

class MySpecializedException2 : public MyException
{
    ...
};

{    
    ...

    try
    {
        throw MySpecializedException1();
    }
    catch ( MyException const &amp; )
    {	
        try
        {
	  // rethrow to handle more detailed
            throw;
        }
        catch ( MySpecializedException1 const &amp; )
        {	
        }
        catch ( MySpecializedException2 const &amp; )
        {
        }
    }
}
</PRE>

<OL START=2>
	<li><p>Due to the fact that between
	construction (where the stack trace is generated) and throwing of an
	object can be arbitrary code an exception object may contain more or
	less unusable stack traces at the time it is caught. 
	</p>
	<OL>
		<LI>If the object is created and
		thrown in the same function the stack is usable. The only thing
		that might be wrong is the source line number (if available at
		all).

		<LI>If the object was passed to
		other functions (via reference) after construction and thrown be
		one of these functions, the stack trace contained in the exception
		object does not even point to the throwing function. Happily, in
		this scenario the compiler will (must?) call the copy constructor
		of the object to throw before throwing it and a usable stack trace
		will be appended.
	</OL>
</OL>

<P>Note: Catching an exception by value instead of catching it by
reference will lead in an additional call to the copy constructor of
the thrown object and therefore add another useless stack trace.
Anyway, catching exceptions via value is generally bad practice,
regardless of this proposal.</P>

<P>Because of the fact 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>that one exception object can have multiple valid stack
	traces at a time and

	<LI>that the copy constructor may be called due to catching by
	value
</UL>

<P>it is important not to omit any existing stack traces when adding
a new trace to the exception.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Content of a Stack Trace Entry</H3>

<P>As there might be more than one stack trace for an exception there
should be added a header for each stack trace appended to the
exception. This header should contain a time stamp and a thread id.</P>

<H2>Summary</H2>

<P>The proposal provides a solution for supplying UNO exceptions with
stack traces automatically. The solution is compatible with UNO3.
There is a slightly cleaner solution that is incompatible but should
be chosen for UNO4. It should be easy to migrate from the UNO3 to the
UNO4 solution.</P>

<P>Although there are even cases where a stack trace is not created
at all when an exception is thrown, the proposed solution covers
mainly all use cases that occur in practice. All the failing or
problematic cases occur very seldom in real life. The most common way
is to construct and throw an exception in the same line of code, for
which creating a useful stack trace works fine.</P>

<H2>Next Steps</H2>

<UL>
	<LI>Platform Technology Team to provide function for generating stack traces

	<LI>Performance measurements for the stack trace generator
	functions in order to define whether generation can be turned on be
	default.

	<LI>Modify cppumaker to support creation of special code for
	com.sun.star.uno.Exception

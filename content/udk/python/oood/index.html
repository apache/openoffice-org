<h1>oood.py - A simple daemon for OpenOffice.org</h1>

<p>oood.py is a daemon, which controls a pool of 'anonymous' office instances
(workers).
<p>
The workers can be used as backend for Java/python/C++ batch
processes for document conversion, mail merges, etc. You don't need to rewrite your current scripts,
a client connects to a daemon-controlled office just as if would connect to a normal office. Up to
now, I only checked the functionality for batch clients, for server clients (e.g. a tomcat or zope),
there may be some problems, you should simply try it.

<p>The daemon ensures, that only one client at a time is connected to one OpenOffice instance
(because one OOo instance in general can't cope with more than one scripter). Workers
get restarted after a certain amount of uses or after office crashes.

<p>A client can connect to a daemon as if it would connect to a normal 'non-daemoned' office,
so you don't need to adapt your scripts.

<p> oood.py has been implemented in pure python, but it
uses some office components. This should make it easy to modify the daemon
to your needs if desired.

<p>
Download: <a href="oood-0.1.0.zip">oood-0.1.0.zip</a> (less than 10k): 
<h1> State </h1>
The daemon comes in version 0.1.0. It is in a alpha state, it has
currently only be tested on Linux x86. It may run on other Unix
platforms, but it is definitely known <strong>not to run on windows</strong>. Simply try
out to check if it is useful for you (after carefully reading this manual).

<p>
The daemon and this document is targeted at experienced OOo script developers.
	
<h1> Security</h1>
The daemon and its usage is in general <strong>INSECURE</strong>. Everyone, who can connect
to the daemon can use the underlying office instances and thus
has full access to the machine (with the daemon's user rights) and
via socket communication to other machines accessible via sockets
from the worker machine.

All worker instances run under the same (= the daemon's userid) meaning
that a menace user may spy other worker office instances.

<p>

However, some simple limitations can be done.
<ul>
<li> Limiting the access to the daemon.<br/>
  You can use the connection string to limit the  access to a certain network interface.
  E.g. using

  socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp

  means, that the daemon (and the underlying office instances) can only be accessed
  from the same machine, where the daemon is running on.

  One may easily extend the daemon source to limit access e.g. to certain hosts.

  There is no user administration.
  
<li> User rights <br/>
  Create a special user for running the office instances. Limit the
  user's rights to the absolute minimum.
</ul>

You should use this solution only in a trustworthy environments.

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2> Office installation</h2>
It is assumed, that you use an office from the 1.1.x series.
The office daemon works on an arbitrary number of office user installations, which
must have been created from the same network installation with a single system user.

Ideally you create a new system user (e.g. oood) therefor, but if you just
want to try it out, you can use your normal system user.

(The following description is more or less copied from a mail by J. Barfurth
in dev@api.openoffice.org).

First do a new multi-user installation ( start

$ setup -net

) from the downloaded installation set.

Afterwards, create multiple single user installations by starting
<p>
(use 01 instead of XX)
<p>

$ setup -d /home/oood/ooo1.1_srvXX

<p>
from within the office/program directory. 
After the setup run, edit ~/.sversionrc file and replace
"OpenOffice.org 1.1.0" with "OpenOffice.org 1.1.0_srvXX". .

Repeat these steps with XX = 02, 03, ... . You need as many installations
as you expect concurrent users. You may also start with a low number
and add instances later on.

Afterwards, your .sversionrc file should look like

<pre>
[Versions]
OpenOffice.org 1.1 srv01=file:///home/oood/ooo1.1_srv01
OpenOffice.org 1.1 srv02=file:///home/oood/ooo1.1_srv02
OpenOffice.org 1.1 srv03=file:///home/oood/ooo1.1_srv03
</pre>

<h2> Daemon installation</h2>
Switch to the OpenOffice.org's program directory and
extract the oood-0.1.0.zip file. Open the oood-0.1.0/oood-config.xml file
in a text editor and add the paths of every worker instances with a

&lt;user-installation url="file:///home/oood/ooo1.1_srv01" /&gt;

tag. For a start, just add one or two instances to see how the daemon is working.
All other settings in oood-config.xml can be left untouched. The meaning
of the other settings are documented in the comments.

<h1>Daemon administration</h1>
<h2>Starting</h2>
The daemon must be started with OpenOffice.org's python from within the OOo's program
directory.
<p>


$ ./python oood-0.1.0/oood.py -c oood-0.1.0/oood-config.xml run

</p>
You get the log on the stdout blocking the shell. Depending on the number of
workers you have configured, it may
take quite a while to start. When you get a

<p>
Accepting on &lt;your-connection-string&gt;
</p>

the daemon is ready to serve requests.

<h2>Stopping</h2>

From a different shell, start 
<p>
$ ./python oood-0.1.0/bin/oood.py -c oood-0.1.0/config/oood-config.xml stop

<p>

Signals the daemon to terminate all running workers and itself.

The daemon can only be stopped this way after a successful startup.

<h2>Requesting status information</h2>
<p>
$ ./python oood-0.1.0/oood.py -c oood-0.1.0/oood-config.xml status
<p>
Gives you a list of workers and their state.

<h1> Usage patterns </h1>
You can now connect to the daemon with an arbitrary (Java, C++, python)
client program in exactly the same way as you connect to a normal
OpenOffice.org.

<p>The daemon delegates your request to one of its worker offices. For the
time of usage, this worker office is exclusively used by your client program.
The end of usage is detected by the daemon through a breakdown
of the interprocess bridge (which occurs, when the last
reference is gone, the client explicitly disposes the remote bridge or
the client process terminates).

<h1> Performance</h1>
All requests to the office are tunneled through the daemon process. This
means an additional load on the server machine and a performance overhead
for every request. This is typically neglectable when your call frequency
is low (say less than 10 Calls/s), but becomes a significant overhead
for higher call frequencies.

<h1>Logging</h1>
<h2> Log level</h2>
<p>There is 3 log levels.</p>

<table border="3" summary="Log levels">
<tr><td>SERIOUS</td><td>Only startup information and errors get written into the log</td></tr>
<tr><td>INFO</td><td>information about every connect and disconnect get logged (default)</td></tr>
<tr><td>DETAIL</td><td>Log level mostly sensible for debugging</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Level INFO includes SERIOUS, DETAIL includes INFO and HIGH.</p>

<h2> Log format </h2>
Every line, that gets logged, has the following format

<pre>
current-time [loglevel] : Logtext
</pre>

The numbers in curly brackets (e.g. {2/5}) in the logtext signals
the free/total number of worker processes in the pool .

<h2> Startup log </h2>
A typical startup log looks as follows ( on INFO loglevel)
<pre>

Wed Nov 26 19:11:19 2003 [SERIOUS]: Started on pid 674
Wed Nov 26 19:11:19 2003 [INFO   ]: Starting office workers ...
Wed Nov 26 19:11:19 2003 [INFO   ]: Worker-0:&lt;oood.OfficeProcess
       file:///home/joergl/OpenOffice.org1.1.0_instance-0;
              pid=692;connectStr=pipe,name=oood-instance-0,usage=0&gt; started
Wed Nov 26 19:11:59 2003 [INFO   ]: {2/2} WorkerAll instances started
Wed Nov 26 19:11:59 2003 [SERIOUS]: Accepting on socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp

</pre>
First line gives the pid of the daemon process (in case
you want to terminate the process during startup). Then follows for
every worker process, that gets started a line showing the used
home directory and connection string.

<h2> Working log </h2>
Below you can see a typical log of a single connect attempt:
<pre>
Wed Nov 26 19:24:02 2003 [INFO  ]: {1/2} -&gt; Worker-0(1 uses) serves localhost:32770
Wed Nov 26 19:24:13 2003 [INFO  ]: localhost:32770 disconnects from Worker-0(1 uses) (used for  10.7s) 
Wed Nov 26 19:24:13 2003 [INFO  ]: {2/2} &lt;- Worker-0(1 uses) reenters pool

</pre>

First line states that out of the pool Worker-0 1is used to serve the incoming
request from localhost:32770. The {1/2} indicates, that there one free worker
left is in the pool.

Second line states, that the interprocess bridge between the daemon
and the requesting process has broken down. Additionally,
the number of uses and the duration of the last use in seconds is shown.

In case, the number of uses is less than the max-usage-count-per-instance,
the process is simply added to the pool of available offices again (as it
documented by the third line. The {2/2} states, that there are now exactly
two workers in the pool again.

In case the max-usage-count-per-instance is exceeded, this worker instance is automatically
terminated and a fresh instance is restarted. This shall tide up memory leaks.

When there is no free worker left anymore and a client request comes in,
the request is rejected and a line like the following gets logged:
<pre>
Sat May 22 22:28:46 2004 [SERIOUS]: {0/2} localhost:32776 rejected
</pre>

The client script simply gets a empty reference instead of the requested object.

<font size="-2">
Note: Preferably it would receive a RuntimeException with an appropriate
message, but a bug somewhere around pyuno, the scripting components
and the remote bridge currently prevents this (the daemons crashes
quite fast).
</font>

<h2> Termination log </h2>
Once daemon termination has been initiated, the log should look like the following:
<pre>
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [SERIOUS]: Accepting on socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp stopped, waiting for shutdownthread
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [INFO   ]: Admin thread terminating
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [INFO   ]: terminating Worker-0(1 uses)
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [INFO   ]: Worker-0(1 uses) terminated
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [INFO   ]: terminating Worker-1(1 uses)
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [INFO   ]: Worker-1(1 uses) terminated
Sat May 22 22:33:00 2004 [SERIOUS]: Terminating normally
</pre>
<h1> Robustness </h1>
Robustness and stability is certainly a key feature of a daemon. The following
situations are currently handled:

<ul>
<li> Running out of workers <br/>
In case all worker instances are busy and the pool is empty, every new
connection attempt is rejected, the client receives an empty reference
instead of the servicemanager or componentcontext object.

<p>
<font size="-2">
Note: Preferably it would receive a RuntimeException with an appropriate
message, but a bug somewhere around pyuno, the scripting components
and the remote bridge currently prevents this (the daemons crashes
quite fast).
</font>

<p>
The connection attempt gets logged appropriately.
<li> A worker office crashes or deadlocks <br/>
Before a worker reenters the pool, it is checked, whether
it is still responsive and it checks whether a deadlock
with the solarmutex blocks the whole office. In case
such a situation occurred, the worker is killed and a fresh
instance is started and added again to the pool.

<p>
The check is currently quite rudimentary, it may
be improved in future.
</li>

<li> Worker processes are restarted after a certain amount of client uses. This ensures,
that an ill office instance will die sooner or later.
</li>

<li> Note: In case the daemon itself crashes (I am currently not aware of such a situation),
           the worker instances don't
           terminate, an admin needs to kill the instances by hand and restart the daemon.
</li>

</ul>

<h1>OpenOffice.org scripting framework and python</h1>
<body>
<a href="../python-bridge.html">Pyuno</a> supports the OOo scripting framework, that
is first shipped with OOo 2.0
(precisely since OOo 1.9.m79 or OOo 2.0 beta).
The current support is limited to the 'core' framework, meaning that execution and
assigning of macros via the standard Tools/Macro dialog works fine,
but editing and debugging macros is not
integrated in OpenOffice.org's UI (simply because of the lack of development
resources). Use your favourite text editor to create and modify python scripts. 


<h1>Script locations</h1>
Scripts to be excuted in OpenOffice.org can be stored within the
following locations:
<p>
<center><img src="macro_run_dlg.PNG"/></center>

<ul>

<li>OpenOffice.org's user directory
<p>
This is the standard place for self written python scripts.
The script files are simply stored within the file system. On windows,
the directory can typically be found in

<table>
<tr>
<td>windows</td>
<td><strong>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;current-user\&gt;Application Data\OpenOffice.org 2.0\user\Scripts\python</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> unix</td>
<td><strong> ~/.openoffice.org.2.0/user/Scripts/python</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>
Note, that the last <strong>python</strong> subdirectory may need to be created
initially. Make sure, the python is completly written lowercase. You can add arbitrary deeply
nested subdirectories, the names of these directories are reflected in the UI.

<p> <strong> Example:</strong>
The <a href="dynamicDialog.py">dynamicDialog.py</a> file can simply be placed in the above
directory. Afterwards, open the Tools/Macros/Run macro dialog and navigate to the position
shown in the above picture. Click on <i>Run</i> to execute the python script, which
opens another dialog with a push button and a label field. Clicking the button will increase
the number within the label field. The dialog can be closed by pressing ESC.

<li>OpenOffice.org's share directory
<p>
Scripts that shall be shared throughout all users of a concrete
OpenOffice.org installation can be stored with the share directory. 
All
default scripts coming with OpenOffice.org are located here. In general,
this directory should not be used for script deployment (see later
uno-packages).
<p>

The script files are simply stored within the file system. The
directory can typically be found in 
<table>
<tr>
<td>windows</td>
<td><strong>C:\Program Files\OpenOffice.org 2.0\share\Scripts\python</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> unix</td>
<td><strong> ~/.openoffice.org.2.0/user/Scripts/python</strong></td>
</tr>
</table>

<li>Embedded within an OpenOffice.org's document
<p>
An OpenOffice.org document is a zip-File, which contains different files.
Python scripts within documents are stored in Scripts/python subdirectory.
<p>
If you want to ship your self written python scripts within a document,

you should first develop your scripts in the (above mentioned) user directory and
then finally move the scripts into the document with your favourite zip tool. However,
note that you <strong>must reassign</strong> every binding you did before to the
script instances in the document. Ideally, you move away the scripts from the user
directory and do a regression test on the document's functionality.

<p>
After moving the script files into the document, you have to add some lines
(<strong>boldly printed</strong>) to the
<i>META-INF/manifest.xml</i> file:

<table width="100%" bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE manifest:manifest PUBLIC "-//OpenOffice.org//DTD Manifest 1.0//EN" "Manifest.dtd"&gt;
&lt;manifest:manifest xmlns:manifest="http://openoffice.org/2001/manifest"&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text" manifest:full-path="/"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="application/vnd.sun.xml.ui.configuration" manifest:full-path="Configurations2/"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="" manifest:full-path="Pictures/"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="text/xml" manifest:full-path="content.xml"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry :media-type="text/xml" manifest:full-path="styles.xml"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="text/xml" manifest:full-path="meta.xml"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="" manifest:full-path="Thumbnails/thumbnail.png"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="" manifest:full-path="Thumbnails/"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="text/xml" manifest:full-path="settings.xml"/&gt;
<strong> &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="" manifest:full-path="Scripts/python/push_me.py"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="application/binary" manifest:full-path="Scripts/python/"/&gt;
 &lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="application/binary" manifest:full-path="Scripts/"/&gt;</strong>
&lt;/manifest:manifest&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

When you open the document afterwards, the OpenOffice.org's UI should warn you about script content within the
document (when this is not the case, you either have switched off the warning in the options or you did
something wrong).

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong>To see how it works, download <a href="push_me_python4.odt">push_me_python4.odt</a>. The
document contains a push button and a multi line edit control. Pressing the button adds a new line with the current
time stamp to the multi line edit control.


</li>
<li>Embedded within a uno-package in OpenOffice.org's user directory (read only)
<p>Often, distributing scripts in documents is not what you want (for instance when you
want to modify the application itself or you want to use the same scripts with multiple
documents ). Therefor you can place your scripts simply within uno-packages.

<p>A uno-package is a zip-file. Its name <strong>must</strong> end with <i>.pkg</i>, otherwise it does not work.
file, where you must define the subdirectory (required!) that shall contain scripts. For instance the sample
<a href="pyhello2.uno.pkg">pyhello2.uno.pkg</a> has the following file structure:

<table width="100%" bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
META-INF/
META-INF/manifest.xml
package/
package/hallo.py
</pre></td></tr></table>

The <i>hallo.py</i> contains the scripts. How to write scripts is explained <a href="#coding">below</a>. However,
in order to make a script work within a uno package, you <strong>must</strong> add some dummy code.
<table width="100%" bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
# ... here is the python script code

# this must be added to every script file (the
# name org.openoffice.script.DummyImplementationForPythonScripts should be changed to something
# different (must be unique within an office installation !)
# --- faked component, dummy to allow registration with unopkg, no functionality expected
import unohelper
g_ImplementationHelper = unohelper.ImplementationHelper()
g_ImplementationHelper.addImplementation( \
	None,"org.openoffice.script.DummyImplementationForPythonScripts", \
    ("org.openoffice.script.DummyServiceForPythonScripts",),)
</pre></td></tr></table>
By default, every .py-file is interpreted as a <a href="../python-bridge.html#components">UNO component</a>. Not
having the above lines within the .py file would raise errors during deployment.
<p>

The directory name (here package) can be choosen freely.
A uno-package with a python script <strong>must</strong> contain a META-INF/manifest.xml, which needs to
point to the freely chosen directory name.

<table width="100%" bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE manifest:manifest PUBLIC "-//OpenOffice.org//DTD Manifest 1.0//EN" "Manifest.dtd"&gt;
&lt;manifest:manifest xmlns:manifest="http://openoffice.org/2001/manifest"&gt;
&lt;manifest:file-entry manifest:media-type="application/vnd.sun.star.framework-script" manifest:full-path="<strong>package</strong>"/&gt;
&lt;/manifest:manifest&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>

Every user can add packages via the package manager (Tools/Package manager). Note, that
content within the package is by design <strong>readonly</strong>, it is really a pure
deployment, not a development mechanism. This might be the reason, why scripts in packages
cannot be viewed via Tools/Macros/Organize macros/Python dialog.
</li>

<li>Embedded within a uno-package in OpenOffice.org's share directory (read only)
<p> Packages can be added by an administrator to a complete OpenOffice.org installation, so that every
user can use run the macros located within the package. This can be done with the <i>unopkg</i> tool.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="coding">Script coding</h1>
A python script within the OpenOffice.org's scripting framework is a function
(introduced by the def keyword) within a .py file. For execution via the
Tools/Macros/Run macro dialog, the script must have an empty argument list.
For typical event listeners, the function must have exactly one argument
(the event). In general, the number of arguments depend on the context
where the function shall be used. 

Since OOo 2.4, you can use both unix and windows linefeeds, in earlier
versions you must use use unix line feeds.

<p>A single .py file
may contain an arbitrary number of function definitions. 
By default, all function definitions are exported ( = shown in the macro
selection dialog). As this may become tedious, exports can be limited to
a smaller set of functions by having a global variable named 
<i>g_exportedScripts</i>, which is a tuple of function definitions.

<p>Up to OOo2.4, .py files can only import python
modules, which are within the python PYTHONPATH, by default this is just the
python runtime and the uno bridge files. This means, that it cannot reference
other python macro files. Since OOo2.4, you can use the mechanism
described <a href="../python-bridge.html#multiple_source_files"> here</a>. Note
that the main script file is reloaded after every change while the source files in
PYHTHONPATH get loaded only once and changes won't have any effect until office restart.

<p>Before executing the source code within the module, the global variable
<i>XSCRIPTCONTEXT</i> is inserted as global variable within the module (this variable
also exists e.g. for javascript and beanshell, it is offered here for consistency reasons).
It has three members (<i>Document</i>,<i>Desktop</i> and <i>ComponentContext</i>).

<p>The comment of a function (introduced and ended by three &quot;) is shown as description
in the macros' selection dialog.

<p>The compiled python script files are not added to sys.modules. There may exist multiple
instances of the same module at the same time.

<p>Example:
<table width="100%" bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
# HelloWorld python script for the scripting framework

def HelloWorldPython( ):
    """Prints the string 'Hello World(in Python)' into the current document"""
    #get the doc from the scripting context which is made available to all scripts
    model = XSCRIPTCONTEXT.getDocument()
    text = model.Text
    cursor = text.createTextCursor()
    text.insertString( cursor, "Hello World(in Python)", 0 )
</pre></td></tr></table>




<h1>Error handling and debugging</h1>
Errors during compilation or execution of the scripts are passed as exceptions to the scripting framework
where possible. The scripting framework in general opens a popup box and displays the message
of the thrown exception.
<p>However, sometimes this is not possible and an error gets silently ignored. The user realizes these
errors, when
<ul>
<li>his python script file does not appear where it is expected to be
<li>the name of the script file appears, but it does not contain any scripts
<li>only part of the script gets executed.
</ul>
You can get to know these problems by changing some flags in the OpenOffice.org 2.0/program/pythonscript.py
file :

<table width="100%" bgcolor="silver"><tr><td><pre>
# Configuration ----------------------------------------------------
LogLevel.use = LogLevel.NONE                # alternavly use LogLevel.ERROR or LogLevel.DEBUG
LOG_STDOUT = False                          # True, writes to stdout
                                            # False, writes to user/Scripts/python/log.txt
ENABLE_EDIT_DIALOG=False                    # offers a minimal editor for editing.
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>Attaching a python debugger is currently not supported.

<h1>Credits</h1>
The python binding of the scripting framework is developed and maintained by Joerg Budischewski in his spare time.
Many, many thanks to Tomas O'Connor from Sun for his great support and his code additions to the framework which
made this binding possible. Please put low level questions about
the binding to <a href="mailto:dev@udk.openoffice.org">dev@udk.openoffice.org</a>. Questions about the
OpenOffice.org's API should be put to <a href="mailto:dev@api.openoffice.org">dev@api.openoffice.org</a>.

<p>All volunteers are different, people with different skills and different levels of commitment/time to spare. This site is dedicated to people interested in localization. For other possibilities please see: <a href="https://openoffice.apache.org/get-involved.html">Apache OpenOffice site</a></p>
<p>You can become a member of the l10n project by first: <a href="mailto:L10N-subscribe@openoffice.apache.org">Sign up for localization mailing list</a> then present yourself and what you would like to do on: <a href="mailto:L10N@openoffice.apache.org">mail list</a> and we will give you more information, and help. Please remember no help is too small! We maintain a list of <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Localization+Volunteers">volunteers</a> where you can sign up just click on &ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo; top right to create an account. Then you will be able to edit the page. The native language files are <a href="http://people.apache.org/~jsc/translation/">here</a>, get your language in the form of a tar.bz2 archive. You will need to uncompress the archive: you can use <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> to do so. It contains 276 files in many directories, but you only need to work on those that have changed. You will need to open all of them (and edit if needed) with <a href="http://poedit.net/">POEdit</a>; try this step and then we will be available to help you again if needed. <strong>Remark</strong> please mark your changes fuzzy (the cloud symbol), that makes it easier to review.</p>
<p>You may want to share work with other volunteers in your language area. In that case, make absolutely sure that either you coordinate by private e-mails or you send an e-mail to L10N saying something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll translate all files in the folders from &lsquo;accessibility&rsquo; to &lsquo;framework&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: after you open the first file with POEdit, you might want to read <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/translate.html">advice</a>. And for any doubts, just write L10N and we&rsquo;ll be happy to assist!</p>

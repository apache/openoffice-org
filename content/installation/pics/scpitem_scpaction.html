of a ScpAction </FONT></FONT>

<P><BR><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">The keyword for the ScpAction
definition is <B>ScpAction</B>. A global ID of a ScpAction should
begin with <B>gid_Scpaction</B>. ScpAction definitions cannot be
assigned to modules, they are global. They even do not appear in the
final setup script, which is placed into the installation set next to
the setup executable. They are useful for scpzip to copy files from
the output tree into the installation set. A restriction for these
files is, that they cannot be packed. The classical exercise for
ScpActions is the copying of the loader from the language dependent
output tree directory. The loader is created in the setup project and
has the name loader.bin respectively loader.exe. In the installation
set you find this file as setup respectively setup.exe. A typical
definition of a ScpAction in the scp projects looks therefore like:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">ScpAction
gid_Scpaction_Copy_loader<BR>#ifdef UNX<BR>Copy =
&quot;loader.bin&quot;;<BR>#else<BR>Copy =
EXENAME(loader);<BR>#endif<BR>Name = EXENAME(setup);<BR>End</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">The
ScpAction definition needs only two assignment. The source name and
the destination name. Copy describes the source name, in this case
loader.bin for Unix and EXENAME(loader) for all other platforms. The
macro EXENAME is defined in the included file macros.inc. The Name
describes the destination name, in this case EXENAME(setup). For
Windows does this mean: Copy the file loader.exe from the output tree
into the installation set as setup.exe. And for Unix: Copy the file
loader.bin from the output tree into the installation set as file
setup. A packing or other feature are not available for ScpActions.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">ScpAction
gid_Scpaction_Flatloader<BR>FlatLoaderZip = &quot;setup_services.rdb&quot;;<BR>End</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">Another
ScpAction needs only one assignment. This is the FlatLoaderZip. The
assigned file setup_services.rdb is needed as internal registry for
the setup. This file is not copied into the installation during the
setup. But the file is packed into the setup zip and therefore
available during the setup process.</FONT></P>

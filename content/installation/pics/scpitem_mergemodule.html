of a MergeModule</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">The keyword for a definition of a
Microsoft merge module is
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><B>MergeModule</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">.
A global ID of a MergeModule should begin with
</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif"><B>gid_Mergemodule</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">.
MergeModules are not assigned to modules defined in the scp project. But for the merge process
it is necessary, that the merge module knows the directory and the feature (in Windows Installer terminology)
under which it is integrated into the Windows Installer database. Additionally the name of the cabinet file
has to be determined, because the cabinet file, that is included into in the msm file, always has to have the same
specific name(MergeModule.CABinet).Therefore the definition of a merge module in scp project is straightforward. An example
definition of a Microsoft VC80 runtime merge module looks like:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
MergeModule gid_Mergemodule_Microsoft_Vc80_Crt_X86
<BR>Name = &quot;Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86.msm&quot;;
<BR>Cabfilename = &quot;openofficeorg-vc80crt.cab&quot;;
<BR>Feature = &quot;gm_Root&quot;;
<BR>Rootdir = &quot;TARGETDIR&quot;;
<BR>End</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, sans-serif">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
The definition of a MergeModule requires a name, that is the name of
the msm file. This file has to be located into one of the include pathes
that are defined in the cvs module instsetoo_native/util/openoffice.lst. There
the file has to be found during packaging process. 
The defined Cabfilename is used in that way, that after successful packaging process
a cabinet file with this name can be found next to the msi database.
Feature and Rootdir are required, because the merge process has to know,
under which directory and under which feature the content of the msm file has
to be integrated into the msi database. For the Rootdir the standard value is
&quot;TARGETDIR&quot;, which is the correct choice in most cases.
The Feature is the installation unit that can be selected or deselected during
installation process. In most cases &quot;gm_Root&quot; is a good choice, so that
the content of the msm file cannot be deselected during installation process.

<H1 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Setup network installation</H1>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">abstract</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">multi user operating systems become
more important today so it would be good if our setup program would
offer better support for these operating systems.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Installation models</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For better support of the multi user
systems we will differentiate between three installation models.
These models are the single user installation, the multi user
installation and the network installation.</P>
<H6 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Single user installation ( Windows
98/ME )</H6>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In a single user installation the
product will be installed in one single step on the computer of the
user. All necessary system configuration ( like writing something
into the registry, installing fonts, creating program groups, etc. )
will be done for this single user. After the installation the product
is ready for use.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When someone else uses the product on
this computer, he will use the same (user) configuration.</P>
<H6 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Multi user installation (Windows NT,
2000, XP, UNIX)</H6>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The system administrator installs the
product into a common location on the computer which can be accessed
by every user. During this installation, most of the system
configuration will be done like font  installation or file types
registration or the creation of program groups and links to the
program files etc. for all users.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Before a user can use the product for
the first time, he has to run the user installation to copy all the
user specific data into a user specific folder. When he tries to
start the product without running the user installation first, the
user installation will be started by the product automatically. When
the user installation has finished, the product will be started
again.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The difference to the single user
installation is that different users of the same computer share the
same product installation but use their own user data.</P>
<H6 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Network installation (all OS, setup
&ndash; net)</H6>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The system administrator installs the
complete product on a network volume that is accessible for all
users. No system specific or user specific installation will be done.
All files and information necessary for user installation (e.g. fonts
) will be stored beside the product so they are available later for
the user installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">A user who wants to use the product
has to start the setup program in the network installation to install
the user specific data on his workstation. This will install the
fonts, register the file types, etc.  After this installation the
user can use the product. When the user tries to start the product
without running the user installation first, the user installation
will be started by the product automatically. When the user
installation has finished, the product will be started again.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">In difference to the multi user
installation the network installation doesn't make any system
configuration nor installs any system files on the user's computer.
This will be done later when the user runs the user installation.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Typical layout of an installation</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">We will always use the network
installation as a base for all three kinds of installation. The
network installation will be done using the default directories
appropriate for the operating system. Optional you can choose another
directory if you want.
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><B>Windows NT / 2000 / XP</B></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">&lt;program

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">/opt/&lt;product
name&gt;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The user installation uses the system
default directories, too. These directories are:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><B>Windows NT / 2000 / XP</B></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">&lt;document

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><B>UNIX / Linux</B></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">$home/.&lt;product
name&gt;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When performing a single user
installation, both installations will be done into the same base
directory the user chooses. This could look like:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><B>Windows NT / 2000 / XP</B></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt">&lt;program
files&gt;\&lt;product name&gt;\...<BR>&lt;program files&gt;\&lt;product
name&gt;\user\...</FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><B>UNIX / Linux</B></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/$home/&lt;product
name&gt;</FONT></FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><FONT FACE="Courier, monospace">/$home/&lt;product
name&gt;/user</FONT></FONT></P>
<H6 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Starting the product after a
multiuser or network installation</H6>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The product has to check on startup,
whether  the user has already done a user installation. To do this
the product has to read its version key from the <B>bootstrap.ini</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
file which should reside next to the executable of the product. In
the next step the product looks for this key in the file </SPAN><B>sversion.ini
/ .sversionrc</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> ( this file is
located in the &lt;documents and settings&gt;\&lt;user&gt;\&lt;application
data&gt; directory for Windows and in the $home directory for UNIX /
Linux ). There a three possible scenarios.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><I>a.) The key couldn't be found in
the sversion.ini or there is no sversion.ini</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">When the
key couldn't be found then probably the user hasn't done the user
installation. Therefor the product launches the user installation and
quits. The setup launches the product after the successful user
installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><I>b) The path behind the key is
invalid</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">When the
key could be found in both file but the path behind the key in the
sversion.ini file is wrong, then something probably went wrong,
therefor the setup program should be started in repair mode. So the
product launches the setup, quits and after the successful repair the
setup launches the product again.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><I>c) The path behind the key is
valid</I></P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">The
product launches as usual.</P>
<H6 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Starting the setup program in a
multi user or network installation</H6>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When the setup is started inside a
multi user or network installation, the setup can't decide
automatically whether it should be used to modify or repair the
current installation or if it is used to perform a user installation
or modify or repair a user installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When the setup finds the version key
in the sversion.ini it will present the user the option to repair or
deinstall or modify the user installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When the setup can't find the version
key it will present the user the option to do a user installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">To repair or modify or deinstall the
multi user / network installation the setup has to be called with the
option <B>-net</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">. For better
access to this option the setup should install an additional link (
or program shortcut ) in the multi user / network  installation that
starts the setup with this option. To prevent<SPAN LANG="en-US">
unauthorized </SPAN>access to this installation, the setup could ask
for a password the system administrator provides during installation
and that could be stored MD5 encoded in the installation database.</SPAN></P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Problems</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">For a network or a multi user
installation privileged access rights might be required.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">The user installation of a network
installation might require  privileged  rights for the user's
workstation, too, for the installation of fonts etc.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When you try to repair an
installation, the setup doesn't know, whether it should repair the
user or the network ( or multi user ) installation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">When the multi user / network
installation has changed, it might be necessary to redo the user
installation.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Questions</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">Choose the installation method
automatically? E.g. use single user installation for Windows 98/ME
and the multi user installation for all other Windows versions or use
always the multi user installation ( this uses a little bit more
space on your harddrive for the user installation data? Use the
network installation when installing on UNIX or Linux?</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">We prefer
always doing a multi user / network installation with an immediately
following user installation when necessary.</P>

  <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/labs/122/office-suites/products.html">best
  all-round office suite</a> is also the cheapest. With excellent Microsoft
  compatibility, a consistent interface and a good network of ad-hoc support,

  <p><strong>Rating:</strong> <img src="images_awards/pcpro_6stars.gif" alt=

  "We should point out here that <em>PC Pro</em> isn't throwing its weight
  behind OpenOffice purely by dint of the fact that it's free. We firmly
  stand by our assertion that it offers a more compelling proposition than
  Microsoft Office; its cross-platform support and the speed at which it's
  being developed leads us to believe that, together with StarOffice, it
  could - nay should - become the dominant force in office suites within the
  next three to five years.<br />

  from poor, buggy office suites. Fortunately,
  <strong>OpenOffice.org</strong> has fixed much of this as <a href=

  its proprietary variant, <a href=
  "http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/index.html">StarOffice</a>)

  <strong>OpenOffice</strong> features improved Microsoft Office file format
  compatibility, the ability to export to useful internet formats such as
  Macromedia Flash for Impress presentations and Draw drawings, and
  dramatically faster startup. Perhaps most exciting is that the suite is now
  truly able to be a universal office suite in a heterogeneous office
  environment, with support for UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as GNU/Linux
  as well as Windows and Mac OS X."</p>

  selects among the exhibitors a product, which has been available on the
  market for no more than one year and which has created the most prominent
  and important appearance on the market. This year, the <strong>Best
  Product</strong> award was granted to <strong>OpenOffice.org</strong>.</p>

  <p>"Says Monitor: 'We believe that the award went to the right hands. The
  winner is <strong>OpenOffice.org</strong> with a Slovenian translation, a
  project with its roots in the computing community rather than in a
  particular company. This is a precedent that will show the extent to which
  open source code can reach, and what can be expected from it in the
  future.'"</p>

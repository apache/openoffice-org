**Description**

Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links to other files. A missing Authorization vulnerability in Apache OpenOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that would cause external links to be loaded without prompt. In the affected versions of Apache OpenOffice, documents that used background fill images, or bullet images, linked to external files would load the contents of those files without prompting the user for permission to do so.

This issue affects Apache OpenOffice: through 4.1.15.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.1.16, which fixes the issue.

**Severity: Moderate**

There are no known exploits of this vulnerability.  
A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.

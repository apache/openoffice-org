        <p>
          <strong>Memory Corruption Vulnerability (Impress Presentations)</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Version 3.0</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Updated October 11, 2016<br />
          Updated August 30, 2016<br />
          Announced July 21, 2016
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          An OpenDocument Presentation .ODP or Presentation Template .OTP file
          can contain invalid presentation elements that lead to memory
          corruption when the document is loaded in Apache OpenOffice Impress.
          The defect may cause the document to appear as corrupted and
          OpenOffice may crash in a recovery-stuck mode requiring manual
          intervention. A crafted exploitation of the defect can allow an
          attacker to cause denial of service (memory corruption and
          application crash) and possible execution of arbitrary code.
        </p>
        <p>Impress cannot be used to directly produce documents having the
           CVE-2016-1513-related defect.  Impress-authored .ODF and .ODT
          documents of an user's own that exhibit any of these characteristics
          are not the result of an exploit.  They may be consequences
          of a separate Impress defect that should be reported.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Severity: Medium</strong>
        </p>

        <p>There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.<br />
          A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Versions Affected</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.<br />
          OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Mitigation</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and
          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOffice 
          <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>
          <br /><br />
          Users of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 that cannot update to 4.1.3
          can Install the 4.1.2-patch1 Hotfix available at 
          <a href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/openoffice/4.1.2-patch1/hotfix.html">http://archive.apache.org/dist/openoffice/4.1.2-patch1/hotfix.html</a>.
          <br /><br />
            A source-code patch that blocks the vulnerability has been developed and is available for developers at <a href="https://bz.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=127045">issue 127045</a> with SVN revision 
            <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1754535">1754535</a>.
          <br /><br />
          Antivirus products can detect documents attempting to exploit this vulnerability by employing Snort Signature IDs 35828-35829.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Defenses and Work-Arounds</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are unable to update, there are other precautions that
          can be taken.  These precausions are recommended for all users
          of all versions of Apache OpenOffice, including the latest
          available.
          <br /><br />
          Avoid operating Apache OpenOffice (and any other personal
          productivity programs) under a computer account that has 
          administrative privileges of any kind. While installation of 
          Apache OpenOffice requires elevated privileges and user permission 
          on platforms such as Microsoft Windows, operation of the software 
          does not.
          <br /><br />
          Keeping antivirus/antimalware software current is also important. 
          This will serve to identify and distinguish suspicious documents 
          that involve the exploit, avoiding confusion with documents that 
          are damaged and/or fail for other reasons.

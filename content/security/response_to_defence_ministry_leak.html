<h2> Response To The French Ministry of Defence Report Leak </h2>
<p>2006-07-20</p>
<p>There has been comment in the media about a report on a French language 
  website: &quot;Le ministère de la Défense met OpenOffice à l'index&quot;
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/informatique/0,39040745,39362096,00.htm">ZDNet article</a>  claims to describe the proceedings of a confidential 
  meeting within the French public administration. It is not appropriate for 
  the OpenOffice.org community to comment on a leak from a private meeting. 
  However, one of the people mentioned in the article, Eric Filiol, has 
  posted two replies to the online article clarifying the purpose of the 
  research and correcting some of the incorrect conclusions in the original 
  article.</p>
<p>The OpenOffice.org office suite is being widely adopted within the French 
  public administration, and the OpenOffice.org community has been working 
  closely with the departments involved. OpenOffice.org is pleased that its 
  source code is being scrutinised by the most important and respected 
  department of security in France.</p>
<p>If security vulnerabilities are suspected, there is a well defined 
  procedure within the IT industry for reporting, analysing, and resolving 
  any issues, which aims to minimise any public announcement (and the 
  resulting creation of exploits) until fixes are available.</p>
<p>The OpenOffice.org community confirms it regards security as of the 
  highest importance and will react immediately to any security issues 
  reported by the French public adminstration or other competent bodies or 
  individuals.</p>

  <h2>Apache OpenOffice Security Team</h2>

  <p>For general information about Apache OpenOffice security, please see our
  <a href="/security/faq.html">Frequently Asked
  Questions page</a>.</p>

  <p>For details of our security alerts by email service, please see our
  <a href="alerts.html">Security Alerts page</a>.</p>

  <p>OpenOffice is a complex piece of software developed by various
  teams. As such, it can contain security relevant bugs. If you are a
  software developer and you believe you have found a vulnerability in our
  source code, please contact our <a href=
  "mailto:security@openoffice.apache.org">security team</a> so we can evaluate
  the problem and work on proper solution for our users and for future
  versions of our product.</p>

  <p>We appreciate early confidential disclosure to give vendors of products
  and solutions based on OpenOffice time to react. We will coordinate the
  disclosure of your report with you.</p>

  <p>In your report, please include the following informations:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In which version of OpenOffice did you identify the problem?</li>

    <li>Do you have an official version of OpenOffice or e.g. a build
    from your GNU/Linux distribution (include the URL of the build if
    possible)?</li>

    <li>What is the impact of the problem (data loss, denial of service,
    executing commands, etc.)?</li>

    <li>How can the problem be reproduced?</li>

    <li>Is there an existing exploit?</li>

    <li>Has the problem already been published?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After we receive your report, we will work on the evaluation and we will
  reply to you (typically in the next business days).</p>

  <p>Vulnerabilities which have been resolved are listed in our <a href=
  "bulletin.html">Bulletin</a>.</p>

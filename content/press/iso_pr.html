<p> All, </p>

<p> 1 May 2006: The International Organization for Standardization (the ISO) has today approved a standard file format to be used worldwide for the storage of files produced by office software (word processor documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, etc.). For the first time in the history of computing, software users will be guaranteed that they will be able to use their data in any compliant software package, both now and in the future. The point of an open standard is that any compliant application can use it. </p>

<p> As Simon Phipps, the Chief Open Source Officer at Sun Microsystems, wrote, </p>

<p> "This is a landmark moment for the Free/Open Source Software movement. An innovation that started here [at OpenOffice.org] has been reviewed, adopted and now endorsed at the highest level as an international standard. We now have a standard for productivity documents that is recognised by governments, which often require ISO approval." </p>

<p> The OpenOffice.org productivity suite fully supports the new ISO/IEC 26300 standard (and since version 2.0 has has fully supported the OpenDocument format on which it is based).  The Project has led the world in charting a new path. </p>

<p> As Louis Suarez-Potts, the OpenOffice.org Community Manager writes, </p>

<p> "The approval by the ISO helps level the playing field and helps clarify what is at stake: your intellectual property, your right to use innovative software. The open standard means not only that your property is not held hostage to the company making the application but also that new applications, new extensions, new ways of doing things can be created. The user wins." </p>

<p> The time is now, the tools are here, the freedom is yours. </p>

Open Source Attracts Public Sector</h2>
<p>“File format compatibility could prompt other public-sector CIOs
to consider similar moves, said Murugan Pal, founder and chief
technology officer of SpikeSource, which sells combinations of
open-source products and support licenses.</p>
<p>&quot;Two hundred years from now, organizations won't want to be
paying software royalties just so they can read documents that were
formatted in a variety of old formats,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Even if OpenDocument isn't the prevailing format years from now,
developers will be able to easily create tools that understand it, he
said. &quot;The moment a format is not owned commercially, anybody
can create an interpreter to read that format,&quot; he added. ”</p>

Why multi-party stewardship of the OpenDocument Format matters so
much</h2>
<p>“Given ODF's multi-party stewardship, the ODF standard is far
more open to incorporating such changes than would be a single-party
controlled format since that single party may have other offerings
that are threatened by the enhancements.  Although such conflicts of
interest are not completely avoided by multi-party stewarded
standards, their likelihood is significantly reduced by the
transparency of the standards setting process.”</p>

representative.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe OpenDocument's approval by ISO/IEC JTC1…will
serve as a gratifying endorsement, making OpenDocument even more
accessible to adopters--particularly those implementing business
solutions for governments--who look to ISO for assurance of long-term
viability,&quot; said OASIS representative Carol Geyer.&quot;

Microsoft 'must support OpenDocument'</h2>
<p>&quot;An OASIS spokeswoman said on Wednesday the public sector is
making &quot;great strides&quot; in terms of user demand for
OpenDocument.</p>
<p>Microsoft will be forced to offer support for OpenDocument if more
organisations decide to use the file format, according to James
Governor, an analyst at RedMonk.</p>
<p>&quot;ODF [OpenDocument] is quite new, and it will take a while
for demand to build. But I don't believe it will need 120,000
requests a month to change Microsoft's mind; just a few more high
profile departures like Massachusetts,&quot; said Governor. &quot;If
Microsoft starts to lose customers because of a lack of ODF support
they will offer a plug-in before you know it.&quot;&quot;

AbiWord gets OpenDocument support from Nokia</h2>
<p>&quot;Support for the OpenDocument file format has been donated by
INdT, Nokia's Technology Institute. Currently the OpenDocument import
filter is basically complete, with support for styles,
headers/footers, lists, image wrapping, text boxes, tables,
footnotes/endnotes and tables of contents. OpenDocument export is
planned as well and will be added during the 2.4.x series.&quot;</p>

Microsoft denies PDF support is a reaction to Massachusetts decision</h2>
<p>&quot;Steven Sinofsky, senior vice president of the Microsoft
Office product development group, had earlier stated that the company
received 120,000 requests a month for the ability to produce PDFs
from within Office.</p>
<p>In any case it seems unlikely that the ability to save Word or
Excel documents as PDFs will sway the Massachusetts Information
Technology Division, especially since Sun Microsystems' StarOffice
and the open source OpenOffice.org project have supported the
creation of PDFs since 2003, and also support OpenDocument.&quot;

RedMonk's Stephen O'Grady about Sun, Google and OpenOffice.org</h2>
<p>&quot;And then there's OpenOffice.org. To me this is far and away
the most interesting of the potential collaboration areas (with the
possible exception of OpenSolaris, but that was not really discussed
a great deal on either call unlike OpenOffice.org). One of the
questions I was asked at least a dozen times between yesterday and
today was what Google might bring to the table with respect to the
Microsoft Office alternative so often in the news of late? Well,
resources for one. A web version? Possible, but I think it'd be very
different functionally than the current codebase - a lot simpler.
While I'll leave that speculation for another time - as we'd be here
a long time - I will say that even a tacit acknowledgement of
OpenOffice.org as a credible platform from Google would be a big win
for the project. If they can further it technically, all the better,
but Google's got sufficient clout at this point to have value just as
a marketing channel.&quot;

<p>Here are some ways Google and Sun could work together</p>
<p>&quot;Let's just say you are using StarOffice Impress, which is
Sun's counterpart to PowerPoint. How about a Picasa icon? Or maybe
even Google Earth, for import of geographical images of that empty
landscape you want to build your plant at for a presentation you are
showing to bankers and developers?</p>
<p>Or say you are writing a document in StarOffice Writer, Sun's
counterpart to (sorry, you get only one guess), Microsoft Word. You
want to know more about a given subject. You simply enter a search
term in the Google toolbar within Writer, click,and your browser
opens up in a new window with a list of search results.</p>
<p>Or, for that matter, you want to share that Impress spreadsheet
with your colleague. Why not IM him or her by means of GoogleTalk
button along the Impress toolbar?&quot;

OpenOffice.org 1.1.5 announced</h2>
<p>OpenOffice.org is proud to announce the immediate availability of
the new 1.1.5 version of the award-winning open source office suite.</p>
<p>This new version is initially available on the Windows

and X86) platforms.</p>
<p>In addition to English, builds for Czech, Danish, French, German,
Japanese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese and
Turkish are immediately available with other localisations following
shortly.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org 1.1.5 introduces import support for documents,
spreadsheets and presentations in OpenDocument format. The
OpenDocument format is an XML based international office document
standard approved by OASIS, the Organisation for the Advancement of
Structured Information Standards. XML based, the OpenDocument format
enables the free exchange of data between compliant software
packages.</p>

<h2 CLASS="western"><a NAME="0.0.SISSL retired|outline"></a>SISSL
retired</h2>
<p>On 2 September 2005 Sun Microsystems announced that it was
retiring the Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL), an Open
Source Initiative (OSI)-approved software license. In recent weeks,
the OSI, which authorises open-source licenses, has been discussing
limiting license proliferation, so as to make the process of choosing
a license easier for developers and companies. Sun's move is in
support of that objective.</p>
<p>How does this move affect OpenOffice.org? As most know,
OpenOffice.org code was launched under the dual banner of the SISSL
and LGPL; licensees could choose which one they wanted to use, and
nearly all have chosen the LGPL. Effective with the announcement that
Sun is retiring the SISSL, however, OpenOffice.org will in the future
only be licensed under the LGPL.</p>
<p>For users, the simplification means: no change. OpenOffice.org
remains free to use, distribute, even sell. One can freely use it in
commercial as well as government environments; nothing has changed.</p>
<p>For vendors, distributors, add-on and plug-in writers of
OpenOffice.org: The LGPL allows for commercial distribution without
affecting derived products in the same way as the GPL.</p>
<p>For developers and other contributors: As the code will be
licensed only under the LGPL, modifications to the source must be
published. (The SISSL did not require all changes to the source to be
published.) As most OpenOffice.org contributors are already openly
contributing to the community, we anticipate no problems. And for
those who have been using the SISSL exclusively, we invite you to
join us.</p>

<p>The Native-Language Confederation is pleased to welcome a new
member in its big family:</p>
<p>The Estonian Native-Language project, led by Ain Vagula and Peeter
Russak. The Estonian Native-Lang project has a fairly impressive
track record because it was active as a localization group long
before it went to existence as a member of the NLC. A team composed
currently of three main members, Ain Vagula, Peeter Russak and Marek
Laane, has been involved in the localization work of  Openoffice.org,
ever since the 1.0.2. This team also developped dictionaries and
distributes CD-Roms.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org is making steady progress in the Baltic region, as
shown by the interest of the Estonian government in getting CD-Roms
including OOo in Estonian. Stay tuned, as the Estonian Native-Lang
project is a small community that can achieve much for
Openoffice.org!</p>

Raising the bar on patents and standards</h2>
<p>&quot;Great news for OpenDocument fans. The guy from Microsoft

raises the bar on what it means to create a truly open standard.
Yesterday, Sun sent to OASIS a new statement concerning patents on
the OpenDocument standard. 
</p>
<p>To decode this statement for you, it says that Sun promises not to
enforce any patent in any country against any implementation of the
OpenDocument format (ODF). That means that, unless you're intending
to sue Sun in connection with ODF, you can use ODF with confidence
and ignore the FUD.&quot;</p>

FOSS word processors compared: OOo Writer, AbiWord, and KWord</h2>
<p>OpenOffice.org receives most of the attention among free and open
source (FOSS) office suites, but users shouldn't forget that free
software includes at least two other word processors: AbiWord, part
of a projected GNOME Office, and KWord, part of the KOffice suite.
From their inception, both have been playing catch-up with
OpenOffice.org's Writer. But now, after several years of development,
 AbiWord and KWord are both reaching early maturity. How do Writer,
AbiWord,  and KWord compare?</p>

a reasonably compatible suite of programs that in many cases works as
well as the hugely popular Microsoft product, though it is a little
lean on extras.</p>
<p>There are converters available for MS Works, but users of Open
Office do rave about its level of compatibility. Being free

initially on the Sun Microsystems commercial product StarOffice.&quot;</p>

Valuable Data Requires Open Formats</h2>
<p>&quot;So I unzipped the OOo archive and checked the styles.xml
file using xmlwf (checking to see if the XML was 'well-formed', which
is step one of two on the road to correctness; the second hurdle is
validity according to the schema). Sure enough, there was a duplicate
element attribute at the line and column indicated in the cryptic OOo
error message.</p>
<p>Edit it out, zip it back up, try again, and ... same error,
different location. But after a couple of iterations the problem was
fixed.</p>
<p>Sure, it was a pain, and sure, it should never have happened. But
in an imperfect world, I'd much rather have my data in an accessible
format that can be manipulated by many different tools than locked up
in an undocumented, proprietary format.&quot;</p>

How Microsoft will try to get more money from Office users</h2>
<p>&quot;But likely to prove controversial is Microsoft intention to
charge users an additional &quot;premium&quot; client access licenses
(CAL) to use these higher-end versions of Office and Windows. Ballmer
and other executives were light on specifics today, although in the
Office market at least Microsoft seems to be going beyond its current
high-end edition of Office Professional Edition, which is priced at
$388.49 per copy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;We will... introduce higher-value versions of existing
products that really help us drive new growth and new value. We did
that with the Professional edition of our Windows product, and it
drove literally billions of dollars of revenue growth versus the home
version,&quot; Ballmer said.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Microsoft's decision to introduce more SKUs and charge higher
prices, though, will expose the company to more accusations from
competitors that is gouging customers while IT budgets are tight. Sun
Microsystems has been pushing StarOffice as a low-priced,
subscription-based alternative to Office to help customers overcome
the pricing issue.&quot;</p>

	<li><p>Uno Runtime Environment  (URE)</p>
</ul>
<p>The URE allows the usage of UNO independently of the
OpenOffice.org productivity suite. UNO is OpenOffice.orgs underlying
component model, allowing language agnostic and remote transparent
development of add-ins, components and applications.</p>
<p>As UNO has already been designed with independence in mind, the
URE is mainly about bundling the appropriate libraries, executables
etc. into their own package. Please have a look at the URE proposal

<p>for details. The URE is planned to be released with OOo 2.0. As
OOo 2.0 is already advanced in its development, the plan is to adapt
OOo to the URE with its next major (see
<a HREF="//issues/show_bug.cgi?id=50467">//issues/show_bug.cgi?id=50467</a>)
release.</p>
<p>XPCom, Bonobo and Mono fans might want to give UNO a try and see
if we can/want to bridge from one component model to another, to
reach higher overall interoperability.</p>
<p>Distro packagers might want to provide the URE (and the OOo SDK)
with their distro, not only as a prerequisite for past OOo 2.0
releases but to enable people to develop UNO components.</p>
<p>Porters might want to port the URE, which is mainly a packaging
task, to their favorite platform.</p>

Opening of an Eurasian Languages Native-Lang Group</h2>
<p>&quot;The Native-Lang Confederation announces the creation of the
Eurasian Languages Group. This group comes as an answer to the needs
of several projects to share their ressources, information, and ease
communication between them and the greater OpenOffice.org community.</p>
<p>As a result,</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>the Russian (http://ru.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Turkish (http://tr.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Georgian (http://ka.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Azeri (http://az.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Ukrainian (http://ua.openoffice.org)</p>
</ul>
<p>native-lang projects form this new group. Rail Aliev, co-lead of
the Russian and Turkish projects, will coordinate the technical &amp;
localization efforts. While there's no clear marketing coordinator,
the Eurasian Languages Group intends to increase its marketing
activities and its awareness inside the OpenOffice.org community.</p>
<p>More Eurasian projects can be added to this list in the future.
This is why the Group would like to invite the existing  Armenian and
Persian Native-Lang projects to join them. Later on, any native-lang
project representing Slavian, Turkic, Altaic and Mongolian languages
and cultures will be able to join this group.</p>
<p>As part of its mission, the Eurasian Native-Lang Group will have
to</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>coordinate  localization efforts and developments</p>
	<li><p>mutualize and help the projects with the localized builds'QA.</p>
	<li><p>speed up the adoption of OpenOffice.org on a local basis and
	help 
	</p>
	<li><p>coordinate its promotion</p>
	<li><p>coordinate documentation writing</p>
	<li><p>communicate with the other projects of OOo and the

<p>&quot;I have a recommendation. A friend of mine who is majoring in
computer science recently turned me on to OpenOffice.org. It is a
free office suite by Sun Microsystems meant to compete with Microsoft
Office. It has a word processor and spreadsheet, presentation and
database software that effectively compete with their equivalents in
Office. It is Mac and PC compatible and will open most other types of
word processing software files. It will also work with any e-mail
program automatically attaching the file you are working on to the
message. It is also available in multiple languages, can be
downloaded for free at Openoffice.org or a cd ordered at the website
for a nominal cost.&quot;</p>

RedMonk's Stephen O'Grady on the OASIS OpenDocument format</h2>
<p>&quot;On some level these arguments fly in the face of the &quot;if
it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; mindset that seems to be prevalent
within Microsoft divisions that have generated quarter after quarter
after quarter of sustained revenue growth, but I think that that
mindset is going to have to change in a world that's increasingly
driven by macro trends like open source and open standards. Are we at
the tipping point in the office format equation was a question I
debated with a vendor yesterday, and the answer, in my mind, is not
yet. But the Open Document Format is still young, and I do think it
ultimately has the power to fundamentally alter the context of
discussions around office productivity software. 
</p>
<p>Microsoft can be proactive and aggressively compete on that basis
now, or they can ignore the demands of governments and ISVs abroad. I
know what I'd choose.&quot;

principal analyst at RedMonk. &quot;The participation of enterprises
in vertical industries, such as aerospace, will also ensure adoption

Tamil Language Open Source Tools &amp; Apps Released in Chennai</h2>
<p>&quot;In Chennai, on April 15th, marking the Tamil New Year,
India's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT)
showed off its latest efforts to help close India's digital divide. A
complete bundle of open source computer software including the
localized Tamil version of OpenOffice.org was released. Hundreds of
computer fonts and tools in Tamil were given away amid great fanfare
and political and media excitement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The report shows, for example, that these schools spend less

<p>I would like to announce the opening of the Albanian Native-Lang
project (sq) led by Mr. Shkumbin Saneja. OpenOffice.org is now
available in Albanian, an ancient culture and language of Southern
Europe.</p>
<p>This project have increased the interest about Open Source
applications,  in Albanian language speaking areas. As there is no
other office suite in Albanian, there are good chances that
OpenOffice.org will take the leading role.</p>
<p>Good luck for the Albanian native-lang project and hopefully we'll
be hearing from OpenOffice.org and other FOSS deployments in Albania
soon!</p>

Spreading OpenOffice Tamil</h2>
<p>I would like to tell you about a great and perhaps an
unprecendented thing that has happened to OpenOffice.org.</p>
<p>On April 15th 2005 the IT Minister of the country dedicated
OpenOffice.org 1.1.4 in Tamil to the Nation and brought it out as a
CD. This CD will be distributed free to those who request for it.</p>
<p>Apart from OpenOffice.org 1.1.4 in Tamil , the CD also contained
open type fonts, Firefox browser , email-client, OCR tools and speel
checkers all for Tamil Language.</p>
<p>In the coming months the ministry plans to distribute about 3
million copies of this CD to Tamilians all over the world.</p>
<p>Already about 50,000 copies of CD have been produced and are being
distributed. 
</p>
<p>So atleast among Tamil Speaking people, we would soon see
everybody using OpenOffice.org instead of proprietary softwares.</p>
<p>Apart from this I also had an opportunity to demo OpenOffice.org
in a TV interview for a Tamil News Channel called &quot;SUN NEWS&quot;</p>
<p>This interview will be telecasted on the &quot;SUN NEWS&quot;
Channel on Sunday 24/04/05 at 17:30pm (Indian Standard Time) .</p>
<p>So big time for OpenOffice.org among Tamilians.  Let us celebrate
the moment.&quot;</p>

therefore embarked on an upgrade project installing OpenOffice on its

could not complete their daily tasks on the new software. Firth says
some of the functions in OpenOffice are accessible via different
keystrokes or mouse clicks, but these changes are easily overcome
with a little coaching. &quot;The savings on licence fees is
enormous,&quot; he notes. &quot;But most importantly, we are saving
money without sacrificing productivity or limiting user

save the district lots of money; like many other districts we have
political and cultural 'challenges'. So, I ask you, have you been
successful in moving your education or business organization from MS
Office to OpenOffice? What were the pros and cons from your
migration? What advice do you have in selling this to tech
coordinators and administrators who are not enlightened by Open
Source?&quot;</p>

OpenOffice.org Announces Version 2.0 Public Beta</h2>
<p>4 MARCH, 2005 - 08H00 UTC</p>
<p>The OpenOffice.org project is pleased to announce that the first
public beta release of OpenOffice.org 2.0 is now available for
download.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org 2.0 Beta is immediately available in English for
Windows, GNU/Linux and Solaris. Additional platforms and
localisations for Brazilian Portuguese, German, Italian, Japanese,
Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Simplified Chinese, Traditional
Chinese and Turkish, amongst others, will follow shortly.</p>
<p>The release of OpenOffice.org 2.0 Beta coincides with the Danish
LinuxForum 2005 and with the Open Source Days in Turkey.  Both events
demonstrate the gaining power of open source and especially the force
for change OpenOffice.org 2.0 represents.  We are honoured to be
included in these important events.</p>
<p>This beta release is the result of many months work in expanding
the functionality, performance and compatibility of the office suite.
This intense effort has yielded impressive results including the
addition of a new database module, implementation of the OASIS
OpenDocument XML file format and a host of other new features and
capabilities.</p>
<p>The public beta release is made available in order to allow a
broad user base to test and evaluate this new major version of
OpenOffice.org, but is not recommended for production deployment at
this stage.</p>

First Native-Lang Group has been launched</h2>
<p>&quot;I would like to announce that the first Native-Language
Group has been launched. To those who are wondering &quot;what is a
native-language group?&quot;, it can be summed up as a group of
several native-lang 
</p>
<p>projects (see: <a HREF="http://native-lang.openoffice.org/">http://native-lang.openoffice.org</a>)
willing to help each others and coordinate their actions.</p>
<p>The first native-language group is the Indic Native-Language
Group, composed of the following communities:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>the Hindi native-lang project (http://hi.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Tamil native-lang project (http://ta.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Bengali native-lang project (http://bn.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Malayalam native-lang project (http://ml.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Telugu native-lang project (http://te.openoffice.org)</p>
	<li><p>the Gujarati native-lang project  (http://gu.openoffice.org)</p>
</ul>
<p>More Indic projects can be added to this list in the future. As
part of its mission, the Indic native-lang group will have to</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>coordinate  localization efforts and developments</p>
	<li><p>mutualize and help the projects with the localized builds'QA.</p>
	<li><p>speed up the adoption of OpenOffice.org on a local basis and
	help coordinate its promotion</p>
	<li><p>coordinate documentation writing</p>
	<li><p>communicate with the other projects of OOo and the
	native-lang confederation</p>
	<li><p>ease the communication between the Indic native-lang projects</p>
</ul>
<p>This group comes as an answer for the native-lang projects to
avoid the &quot;walled garden&quot; effect that some projects have to
face, while at the mean time help these projects who lack ressources
and time to develop and build themselves. Expect more groups to come
in a near future.</p>
<p>I would also like to congratulate Vijay Kumar and Rajesh Rajan for
their newly appointed positions as the Group coordinators. Meanwhile,
the rights and deeds of the native-lang projects' leads remain
unchanged.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Charles-H. Schulz,</p>

OpenOffice.org Beta 2.0: Trouble for Microsoft</h2>
<p>&quot;OpenOffice has many features, but one of the most
significant features for first time users has to be the crossover
between the various modules. The knowledge gained in Writers easily
transferred to Calc and vice-versa. This makes working with
OpenOffice.org very comfortable, even more so than Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>OpenOffice has reached the stage of being able to competently and
comfortably replace Microsoft Office as your main office suite.
Consider the fact that it is free, and yet manages to beat Microsoft
Office at it's own game; it's a compliment in itself. The only thing
that you have to do now is wait for the final version of OpenOffice
2.0 to begin your journey to the world of Open Source. If you are
impatient to begin, grab the beta and dive right in. The water's
fine.&quot;</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.cooltechzone.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1073">http://www.cooltechzone.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1073</a></p>
<h2 CLASS="western"><a NAME="0.0.First look: OpenOffice.org version 2.0 beta|outline"></a>
First look: OpenOffice.org version 2.0 beta</h2>
<p>&quot;OpenOffice.org has always been conservative with version
numbers. Enough minor releases have boasted enough new features that
the current release could easily be 3.0 or 4.0 instead of 1.1.4.
Given this record, it's hardly surprising that version 2.0, for which
beta code is set to be unveiled very shortly, amounts to a major
rewrite of the software. Although key functionality remains largely
intact, version 2.0 promises dozens, possibly hundreds, of changes.
Many times during our testing of the pre-beta release, we felt we
could almost have been looking at an entirely new piece of software.&quot;</p>
<p><a HREF="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/02/25/209222">http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/02/25/209222</a></p>
<h2 CLASS="western"><a NAME="0.0.A first look at OpenOffice.org 2.0|outline"></a>
A first look at OpenOffice.org 2.0</h2>
<p>&quot;It is not too bold to say that OpenOffice.org 2.0 will usher
in a new era of functionality, reliability, compatibility and ease of
use. The extensive changes and enhancements which are to be included
in the upcoming release are all the evidence needed to justify this
assertion.</p>
<p>For those who are impatient and unwilling to wait for the final
release, today sees the public availability of the first beta version
of OpenOffice.org 2.0. This beta is not for the faint of heart, and
should not be considered as reliable or be used in a production
environment.&quot;</p>

convince customers that Longhorn will offer more than incremental

OpenOffice can increasingly be the functional equivalent of what

choice but will charge more for the Microsoft alternatives -- and

Microsoft Office is too dangerous to leave with users</h2>
<p>&quot;Just as eliminating MSN Messenger and replacing MS-Outlook
with Thunderbird (or presently Evolution) improves your corporate
security, so does replacing MS-Office with OpenOffice.org or another
office suite.</p>
<p>Careful planning will avoid rubbing your users up the wrong way.
Any change produces resistance, and by minimising the changes
(converting beloved templates, making conditions under the new suite
better, sending copies home especially with people who only have
MS-Works or MS-Word there etc) you can maximise acceptance.</p>
<p>Make OpenOffice the default or only office suite on new installs.
Use it yourself, for everything; train your technical people up on it
so they become used to using and installing it by default and your
other users will see the &quot;elites&quot; using it.</p>
<p>Since OpenOffice is now available to more than 10% of all desktops
and the file format is about to become a European standard, it is now
more socially reasonable to send office documents in the OASIS format
adopted by OpenOffice.&quot;</p>

recent media reports that claim Microsoft has opened up its Office
file formats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wilcox explained that Eric Kriss, Massachusetts Secretary of
Administration and Finance, simply announced that the Commonwealth
had modified its position on open formats. &quot;Under the change,
Microsoft Office file formats could be considered open by the
Commonwealth, depending on the terms of usage.&quot;&quot;</p>

<h2 CLASS="western"><a NAME="0.0.StarOffice 8 goes beta|outline"></a>StarOffice
8 goes beta</h2>
<p>&quot;Sun released a beta version of office productivity
application StarOffice 8 on Thursday, which it says provides improved
compatibility with Microsoft Office files and a new database
front-end tool.</p>
<p>StarOffice already allows users to open and save Microsoft Office
files, but a lack of full interoperability has caused problems for
users migrating from MS Office. Sun claims that StarOffice 8&quot;
significantly improves&quot; the compatability between StarOffice and
MS Office files, according to a PDF available on Sun's Web site.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The database front-end tool in StarOffice, StarOffice Base, has
been &quot;totally re-designed&quot; to make it easier for users to
create forms, queries and reports, according to Sun. Stephen O'Grady,
senior analyst at RedMonk, said the database is a useful feature in
StarOffice and is likely to compete with Microsoft Access.&quot;</p>

New Sun StarOffice 8.0 Beta Looks a Lot Like Microsoft Office 2003</h2>
<p>&quot;Chief among these improvements, in my opinion, is its new
look and feel, which is modeled after Office 2003. That's right;
despite some rough edges (the StarOffice 8.0 beta still has the
insane and control-heavy configuration dialog boxes that earlier
releases used), the product does a credible job of emulating the
latest version of  Microsoft's product. And those rough edges are all
that separates this otherwise impressive product from its much more
expensive competition. If Sun can fix the dialog boxes, the product
will be a winner. For the free beta download, visit Sun's Web site.&quot;</p>

<p>After some progress, I'm very pleased to announce I have for the
first time started an OOo version (1.9.71s1 here)  on Mac OSX
(X11/Mac OSX 10.3.4)!</p>
<p>The first try wasn't very beautyfull, because I've made the first
start with only openoffice-core....I have put some snapshots here:

</ul>
<p>But with Florian Heckl tip about the packaging , I finally
obtained a full 1.9.71-1 version on Mac OSX, as .pkg packages!</p>
<p>About the build, the process is complete, excepted for
binfilter***</p>
<p>So, I couldn't resist to put some other screenshots here :

</ul>
<p>in.png format (following Kazunari Hirano's advice ) more easy to
use for everyone.</p>
<p>Sure, a lot of work is to do before a completely functional
(stable over all) version of OpenOffice.org2.0 can be used on Mac
OSX, but whith this, an enormous progress is done!</p>
<p>This work is not only my work, but the result of help and sharing
of knowledge by/with a lot of people like Kevin Hendricks, Pavel
Janik, Rene Engelhard, Eric Hoch (of course), Torsten (b_osi), Maho
Nakata, Jim Watson, Florian Heckl and all the others. 
</p>
<p>Sorry for the one I forgot the names. And many thank's to Sun for
all.</p>
<p>I sincerily hope this &quot;proof of concept&quot; will concince
that 
</p>
<p>*it is possible !*</p>
<p>So, what about the Next Step  ? (not a play on words :-) ) ...
change the look and feel of OOo, transforming this great software in
a &quot;real&quot; Mac OSX application ? 
</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>

</p>
<p>With recent changes to local legislation, software non-compliance
can result in criminal penalties. Infringement of this act happens
through under-licensing or with the use of unauthorised or pirated
software in a business environment. This shift has been a catalyst
for various organizations to rethink their choice of office
productivity software to ensure that they do not contravene the new
rulings. Many have stated that they are looking for more cost
effective alternatives. According to a survey conducted by the
Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, it revealed that 64.8% of
115 respondents suggested the need to lower the financial costs of
software acquisition and ownership in response to adhering to this
law.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;However, this is thought to be a move to open-source
software, encouraged by Vendrik's motion. A survey undertaken last
year by the Maastricht Economic Research Institute on Innovation and
Technology (MERIT) suggested that open source is making gains in the
Dutch public sector, and awareness of it was increasing. The survey
was however commissioned by the OSOSS (Open Standards and Open Source
Software).</p>
<p>And the town of Haarlem has reportedly already moved over 2,000
desktops over to OpenOffice in order to save on its 500,000 euro
software licence costs. Reports suggest that training and migration
cost Haarlem burghers 50,000 euros (about &pound;35,000),
representing a saving of about 90 per cent over an upgrade to
Microsoft Office 2000.&quot;</p>

MS Office 12's Competition: Its Older Versions and Linux Suites</h2>
<p>&quot;For example, he pointed to an ad hoc survey taken at a
recent Gartner conference, where about 15 percent of enterprise
customers reported using Office 97, even though the software has been
orphaned by Microsoft and suffers from a growing list of security
issues.</p>
<p>&quot;To Microsoft's dismay, Office 97 didn't stop working when
they stopped supporting it,&quot; Silver said. &quot;Since Office
2000, companies have moved very slowly to upgrade, although Office
2003 has an appeal for mobile workers.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Silver, about 45 percent of larger enterprises are
still using Office 2000, with less than 10 percent using the current
Office 2003. He expects a greater shift to Office 2003 in 2005.</p>
<p>Silver said more interest in StarOffice and OpenOffice could be
sparked when customers now running Office 2000 decide to upgrade. He
also suggested that enterprises will be more interested when their
existing Software Assurance contracts expire.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Longhorn time frame, when older versions look really
old, that will be an opportunity for Sun or OpenOffice.org to pick up
some market share,&quot; he said. &quot;</p>

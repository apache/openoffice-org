<h3> <a name="10" id="10"></a>OpenOffice.org 2.0: A Choice for A Real Change </h3>

<p>OpenOffice.org released the long-awaited version 2.0 of its free
office suite for Windows, Mac and Linux on 20 October 2005 adding a new
database module, support for the OpenDocument file format, a fresh user
interface, and plenty of improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>OpenOffice.org 2.0 is the first open source office suite to offer
thorough support for the Open Document Format for Office Applications
(OpenDocument) OASIS Standard. OpenDocument is an XML file format that
was developed by <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/home/index.php">OASIS</a>,
the international body for the development and ratification of
e-Business standards. The OpenDocument format can be used by any office
application without fear of vendor specific lock-in or onerous
licensing terms and fees, with the confidence that documents can be
viewed, edited and printed for generations to come.</p>
<p>The suite now also offers a database module, Base, to complement the
word processor (Writer), spreadsheet manager (Calc), presentation
manager (Impress) and drawing tool (Draw) modules. These give all users
the tools they need to be productive in the modern world. Free for all,
OpenOffice.org offers everyone the enduring freedoms to use, study,
improve and share the software. Users can download it for free from the
Project's Web page at <a href="/download/2.0.0/index.html">/download/2.0.0/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>With a new user interface, OpenOffice.org 2.0 is easy to learn and
use by the most inexperienced user, and is significantly more
compatible with Microsoft Office files than prior versions. Supported
by dozens of professional companies, OpenOffice.org 2.0 will be
available in more than 60 languages. Able to run on Microsoft Windows,
GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris and other platforms, OpenOffice.org is
increasingly the choice of businesses and governments throughout the
world, and earlier versions have been downloaded over 49 million times
since the project's inception.</p>

<h3> <a name="15" id="15"></a>What People Are Saying About OpenOffice.org </h3>
<p>"OpenOffice.org is on a path toward being the most popular office
suite the world has ever seen; providing users with safety, choice, and
an opportunity to participate in one of the broadest community efforts
the Internet has ever seen. As a member of that community, I'd like to
offer my heartiest congratulations." <br>
  -- <cite>Jonathan Schwartz, President and COO of Sun Microsystems</cite></p>
<p>"We're coming full circle in an exciting example of how the open
source and open standards communities can support one another. In 2002,
the OpenOffice.org formats were submitted to OASIS and became the
OpenDocument format, which was advanced by our members and approved as
an OASIS Standard earlier this year," recalled <cite>Patrick Gannon, President and CEO of OASIS.</cite>
"Today's announcement of OpenOffice v2.0, with its support for
OpenDocument, is evidence that when open source software and open
standards activities collaborate and cooperate, both efforts can reap
productive results that serve the needs of a broader marketplace."</p>
<p>OpenOffice 2.0 is a big deal, and the anniversary underlines that
this isn't some new, untried technology. In the 21st century, you can
get your desktop work done without having to pay onerous up-front
licensing costs and without having your data locked up in in somebody
else's file format. Why would you work any other way?"<br>
  -- <cite>Tim Bray, Sun Microsystems</cite></p>
<p>"As part of our Open Source Software introduction we recently
started deploying OpenOffice.org at the City of Vienna. In just 6 weeks
we achieved more than 1,600 installations of OpenOffice.org and the
rollout will continue over the next months. We are very happy about the
functionality and quality of the OpenOffice.org software. We are
confident that OpenOffice.org will be made available to all of our
18,000 workstation users." <br>
  -- <cite>Brigitte Lutz, City of Vienna</cite></p>

<h3> <a name="20" id="20"></a>What's New in OpenOffice.org 2.0 </h3>
<p>In addition to a complete overhaul to the user interface and the new
database module, many more features have been introduced in
OpenOffice.org 2.0. A detailed listing of these changes and
enhancements can be found in the guide to new features at <a href="//dev_docs/features/2.0/"> //dev_docs/features/2.0/</a> and <a href="//product/"> //product/</a>. A summary of the most important of these follows.</p>
<h4>New Interface</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, the new user interface to OpenOffice.org 2.0
provides a number of productivity enhancements and is designed to
assist in the transition from proprietary office suites while letting
new and existing users take advantage from a brand new, appealing,
functional and easy to use interface. The introduction of multi-pane
views, floating toolbars and native desktop integration in all modules,
provides a familiar interface and a great deal of flexibility in how
the user can interact with the application. Of course, OpenOffice.org
provides for extensive customisation of the menus, toolbars and
shortcuts to suit the particular needs of any user.</p>
<h4>Database Module (OpenOffice.org Base)</h4>
<p>This release sees the debut of OpenOffice.org <a href="../../product/base.html">Base</a>,
a database module capable of creating self-contained, portable and
cross-platform database applications. The self-contained, portable
database files are made possible by utilising the HSQLDB database
engine, which is implemented in Java, allowing complete cross-platform
compatibility and functionality between GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft
Windows and Sun Solaris users. </p>
<p>Any database application developed in OpenOffice.org using this
database platform is immediately portable to users on any operating
system supported by the OpenOffice.org office suite.</p>
<h4>OpenDocument Format</h4>
<p>The OpenDocument format was approved as an OASIS (Organization for
the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) standard earlier
this year. OpenDocument has since been submitted to ISO (International
Standards Organisation) for ratification as a public standard.</p>
<p>OpenOffice.org 2.0 is the first open source office suite to offer
full support for the OpenDocument format, an XML file format
specification suitable for office applications including text,
spreadsheets, charts, and graphical documents.</p>
For further information about OpenDocument, see our <a href="#75">Related Information</a> links below.
<h4>Enhanced PDF Export</h4>
<p>For those who wish to distribute documents in a non-editable format,
the very popular PDF export feature, introduced in OpenOffice.org 1.1,
has been greatly enhanced in this release. The PDF export now gives
greater control over the quality and size of PDFs generated as well as
providing support for links, indexes, forms, thumbnails and
presentation transition effects.</p>
<h4>XForms</h4>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XForms">XForms</a> are now
much easier to create, edit and use, thanks to their complete
integration inside OpenOffice.org. XForms support is important as this
represents one more steps in the direction of more interactivity and
connectivity inside documents. OpenOffice.org definitely leads in this
direction and does this in by supporting standards, freedom and
openness. XForms is the standard for web forms defined by the W3C
consortium (<a href="http://www.w3c.org/">http://www.w3c.org/</a>), the body defining the web standards.</p>
<!--[WAITING ON POTENTIAL QUOTE FROM KURT CAGEL]-->
<h4>Improvements to Calc (Spreadsheet)</h4>
<p>The <a href="../../product/calc.html">Calc</a> module has now been
expanded to support up to 65,536 rows of data. This enhancement will
allow advanced users to make fuller use of OpenOffice.org Calc when
dealing with vast quantities of data. In addition, significant
improvements have been made to the DataPilot feature, enabling users to
carry out advanced analysis of data stored in spreadsheets and
databases.</p>
<h4>Compatibility</h4>
<p>Significant improvements have been made in the functionality of
proprietary office suite filters, allowing for improved compatibility
between office applications, including Microsoft Office. In addition,
import support for Corel WordPerfect documents has been added, allowing
for easier cross-suite communication.</p>
<h4>Other Features of Interest</h4>
<p>Word Count<br> The basic Word Count functionality provided in
earlier versions of OpenOffice.org has now been extended to include
advanced information including a count of selected words and
characters. This feature has now been moved to a more accessible
location.</p>
<p>Digital Signatures<br>
  OpenOffice.org 2.0 now offers the facility to apply Digital Signatures to documents using standard digital certificates.</p>
<p>Native Installers<br> OpenOffice.org 2.0 supports native
installation mechanisms. For example, .MSI and .CAB files are provided
on Microsoft Windows, and RPM files are available for Linux making it
easier for end-users to install on their computer system.</p>

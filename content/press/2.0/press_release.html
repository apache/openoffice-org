<p class="Header"><a name="announcement"></a>OpenOffice.org 2.0 Is Here</p>
<p> 20 October, 2005</p>
<p> OpenOffice.org 2.0 is the productivity suite that individuals,
governments, and corporations around the world have been expecting for
the last two years. Easy to use and fluidly interoperable with every
major office suite, OpenOffice.org 2.0 realises the potential of open
source. Besides a powerful new database module and advanced XML
capabilities, OpenOffice.org natively supports the internationally
standardised OpenDocument format, which several countries, as well as
the U.S. state of Massachusetts, have established as the default for
office documents. More than any other suite, OpenOffice.org 2.0 gives
users around the globe the tools to be engaged and productive members
of their society.</p>

<p>Available in 36 languages, with more on the way, and able to run
natively on Windows, GNU/Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac OS X (X11) and several
other platforms, OpenOffice.org banishes software segregation and
isolation and dramatically levels the playing field. And, with its
support for the OASIS Standard OpenDocument format, OpenOffice.org
eliminates the fear of vendor lock in or format obsolescence. The
OpenDocument format can be used by any office application, ensuring
that documents can be viewed, edited and printed for generations to
come. OpenOffice.org 2.0 is a breath of hope for small economies that
can now have a local language office suite well adapted to their needs
and to their economical possibilities, reducing their dependency on the
interests of proprietary software vendors.</p>

<p>"OpenOffice.org is on a path toward being the most popular office
suite the world has ever seen; providing users with safety, choice, and
an opportunity to participate in one of the broadest community efforts
the Internet has ever seen. As a member of that community, I'd like to
offer my heartiest congratulations." - Jonathan Schwartz - President
and COO of Sun Microsystems.</p>

<p> Built by a community including Sun Microsystems, its primary
sponsor and contributor, Novell, Red Hat, Debian, Propylon, Intel, as
well as independent programmers, translators, writers, and marketers;
OpenOffice.org 2.0 demonstrates the success, dedication and proficiency
of the open source software community.</p>

<p>That community now includes the City of Vienna, which recently
started deploying OpenOffice.org throughout. "We are very happy about
the functionality and quality of the OpenOffice.org software. We are
confident that OpenOffice.org will be made available to all of our
18,000 workstation users." - Brigitte Lutz, City of Vienna.</p>


<p>Louis Su&aacute;rez-Potts, OpenOffice.org Community Manager,
commented that "OpenOffice.org 2.0 is the culmination of a
collaborative process involving thousands working in dozens of
languages everywhere in the world. It shows that open source can
produce software of the highest quality and assure the robustness,
usability and security that users expect in their office suite." </p>

<p> In addition to the OpenDocument format, the redesigned user
interface and a new database module, OpenOffice.org 2.0 also adds
improved PDF support, a superior spreadsheet module, enhanced desktop
integration and several other features that take advantage of its
advanced XML capabilities, such as the ability to easily create, edit
and use XForms.</p>

<strong>FIVE YEARS OF OPENOFFICE.ORG, MORE TO COME
</strong>
<p><strong>13 October, 2005 - 1400 UTC</strong></p>
<p>On this day, five years ago, the fledgling OpenOffice.org community 
  provided the first public access to the source code donated from 
  StarOffice by Sun Microsystems. The OpenOffice.org community had 
  recently been formed, and declared it's intent &quot;to create, as a 
  community, the leading international office suite that will run on all 
  major platforms and provide access to all functionality and data&quot;. Since 
  then, the popularity and functionality of the OpenOffice.org office 
  productivity suite has grown exponentially and has had a major impact 
  not only in the greater Open Source community, but for all users of 
  office productivity software, worldwide</p>
<p>The last five years have not only seen significant improvements in the 
  software, but also a notable growth in the community and a number of 
  organisational changes. These changes include the tremendous growth of 
  the Native Language Confederation, which now numbers thousands of 
  contributors, the establishment of a Community Council, and the 
  Engineering Steering Committee, both of which go a long way to improving 
  communication and transparency in one of the largest open-source 
  communities. OpenOffice.org developers and contributors number in the 
  thousands and they live in every part of the globe. From its early days 
  to now, OpenOffice.org has been international in scope and mission.</p>
<p>Significant contributions from many organisations including Novell, Red 
  Hat, Debian, Propylon, Intel and primary sponsor Sun Microsystems, 
  ensure the ongoing presence and support of OpenOffice.org. Independent 
  contributors also make a considerable impact in terms of code 
  development, marketing, translation, documentation and web presence.</p>
<p>The OpenOffice.org community looks forward to the continuing the 
  expansion, enhancement and innovation of technologies within the suite.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, there is more to come.</p>

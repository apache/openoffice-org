<p>Last summer, Google sponsored a <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code,</a> program "designed to introduce students to the world of open-source software development."  OpenOffice.org is one of the participants. Several students worked on OpenOffice.org during their summer and their reactions and insights can be read in a series of <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/editorial/summer_of_code.html">interviews</a>. </p>

<p class="Header"><a name="mission"></a>Mission of the University Project </p>
<p>To encourage the use of OpenOffice.org by post-secondary school staff, faculty, and students, and to provide a central node for the development of OpenOffice.org by students, either working alone or in a class.</p>
<p class="Header"><a name="background"></a>Background</p>
<p>Increasingly, faculty and staff at post-secondary institutions, both public and private, are using OpenOffice.org. Equally, more and more professors and students are considering OpenOffice.org as reasonable for learning programming and development.&nbsp; This project therefore has two main aims:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encouraging use of OpenOffice.org</li>
  <li>Encouraging development of OpenOffice.org</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first category, we work with the larger <a href="/index.html">Marketing Project</a>; in the second, with other extant development projects.&nbsp; However, there are unique elements characterizing student work on OpenOffice.org. Students may work independently; or they may work jointly, as a team; or they may be working to satisfy course requirements.</p>
<p><a name="maillist"></a>Mail List</p>
<p>We use for discussions on growing the use of OpenOffice.org in post-secondary institutions the educ@marketing.openoffice.org list. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Subscribe: Send a blank email (no subject, no content) to <a href="mailto:educ-subscribe@marketing.openoffice.org">educ-subscribe@marketing.openoffice.org</a></li>

</ul>
<p class="Header"><a name="contributing"></a>Contributing</p>
<p>There are several ways one can contribute to this subproject.&nbsp; If you know of a post-secondary institution using (or planning on using) OpenOffice.org, let us know by sending a note to <a href="mailto:educ@marketing.openoffice.org">educ@marketing.openoffice.org</a>, the list for this project.&nbsp; We would like to add to the list <a href="#list">below</a>.&nbsp; We can further help by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walking post-secondary schools through the process of including OpenOffice.org in their portfolio of applications</li>
  <li>Resolving questions related to using and deploying OpenOffice.org by faculty, students, and staff</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, if you are interested in developing OpenOffice.org, either individually or as part of coursework, there are several ways this project can help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Suggest and coordinate group work in the development projects</li>
  <li>Suggest a workflow plan for courses using OpenOffice.org to teach programming. To this end, we have sketched a <a href="course_workflow.html">preliminary course plan </a> that is free to be used and improved upon</li>
</ul>

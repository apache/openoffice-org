            with the desire to join what seemed, in the late 90s,
            to be a movement that would permanently change the way
            software was produced. CollabNet, founded by Brian
            Behlendorf of Apache fame and funded by a stellar
            group, was contracted by Sun Microsystems to provide
            the collaborative work environment for what was hailed
            as the largest open-source project in the world.<br />
            No one expected success, at least not on the level that
            we have seen. There was not even what would count as a
            valid measure of success, when the project was
            conceived. Open source held the promise of simplifying
            software development, of allowing corporations to get
            to market faster, and of generally improving the code.
            All these have turned out to be true, albeit with some
            qualifications (what counts as "get to market"?). But
            no one anticipated that OpenOffice.org would engage the
            millions of endusers it has and gain such an enormous
            following outside USA's borders; and no one anticipated
            that the infrastructure on which OpenOffice.org runs,
            an early version of CollabNet's SourceCast, would be
            able to handle a participant community of 90,000
            registered users and developers, working side by side,
            collaborating trans-nationally.<br />
            This paper examines where we stand today in terms of
            community organization, and involvement. It touches on
            the present political and technical structure of
            OpenOffice.org. It then moves on to discuss what the
            future of the project may look like, from a
            technological, community, and political perspective (by
            "political" I mean a politics specific to
            OpenOffice.org, not the wider world). This paper will
            be of interest to anyone who is curious as to where
            OpenOffice.org is going and how it is going to get
            there.</td>

              I am an instructor in the Computer Engineering
              Technology Department, Palliser Campus, of the
              Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and
              Technology in Moose Jaw Saskatchewan, Canada. It is a
              5 semester course (4 months/semester) with 3
              semesters of work terms. The course is accredited by
              the Canadian Association of Technicians and
              Technologists.<br />
               The decision was made more than two years ago to
              teach OpenOffice (StarOffice initially) to all the
              1st semester students as an introduction to computer
              applications. This also requires that the students
              use OpenOffice when submitting required lab reports
              and various homework assignments.<br />
               The Department was using the WordPerfect Office
              suite. We were starting to have problems with license
              and compatibility between versions. In addition, the
              students were resorting to bootlegged versions of the
              software for their home computers. The Department
              goal was to have all the students use the same base
              software so there would be no problems with some
              having a spread sheet that didn't work right, and
              others with spell check problems, and so on.<br />
               We had talked about doing something with the course
              and the software for a while, but because we could
              see a big job ahead of us, we did what anybody else
              would do; hope that the college would buy us out for
              retirement. As it turned out, the decision was made
              for us. We got a list of the number of students
              coming into 1st semester and looked at our computer
              labs. Another lab was needed and we had 3 days and no
              software budget. The Department had some experience
              with Linux and I had been using StarOffice from the
              moment Sun released it. The decision was made; we
              rolled out StarOffice/OpenOffice and Linux.<br />
               None of the horror stories that would be expected
              from making a total change in office application and
              operating system software occurred, but we were
              totally surprised by some of the unexpected things
              that happened. For example, the initial apathy by the
              students, and the apprehension of going into a
              "Microsoft Free Zone"
              computer lab.<br />
               Nothing is harder on a computer lab than 1st
              semester students who think they know what they are
              doing. The lab required some attention for the first
              week with permission and password problems; after
              that, it was virtually maintenance free.<br />
               I plan on adding more open source software (MySQL
              and PHP) to the 1st semester course next
              September.<br />

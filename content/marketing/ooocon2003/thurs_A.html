              This session describes the opportunities to extend or
              control OpenOffice.org with Java or other languages
              where an UNO language binding exists.<br />
               OpenOffice.org is an open source driven office
              productivity formerly based on StarOffice. While it
              is widely known that OpenOffice.org is multi-platform
              and that it is fully compatible with the Microsoft
              Office formats, few to date are aware that it offers
              a complete API for developers to support the creation
              of own extension or the control of OpenOffice.org
              from own applications. The API based on the Universal
              Network Objects (UNO) component model which allows
              the integration of 100% pure Java components in
              OpenOffice.org. It is also possible to control
              OpenOffice.org from a Java application to use the
              provided office functionality for example a report
              generator or a document converter.<br />
               The session gives an introduction into the UNO
              component model and it will discuss the main API
              concepts (hopefully this section will be an extra
              session). The capabilities of the API are
              demonstrated using some examples of Java-UNO
              components. The session provides an overview about
              the OpenOffice.org Software Development Kit
              (SDK).<br />
               The attendees will learn how to use, extend and
              customize a professional office application with
              Java. They learn to create highly integrated office
              components in Java which are platform independent and
              can be used on every platform where OpenOffice.org
              and Java will be available. This is an advantage for
              all who want to create extensions for their office
              environment or a wider audience.

            These systems allow involvement of a large number of
            people in the localization of OpenOffice.org. This
            system has been used for the Hungarian localization
            (which is, sadly, far not 100% finished, as of today).
            I will also present a "next generation" localization
            tool, which is not implemented yet. This tool should
            make localization as easy as clicking with the mouse
            and entering text.<br />
             My talk will be about tools for OpenOffice.org
            allowing distributed, Internet-based translation. I
            will present two programs and scenarios which helped to
            translatethe OpenOffice.org strings and the
            OpenOffice.org help, and a plan of an interactive
            program, that could make doing translations and
            revisions easy and very productive.<br />
             The first program has been used to translate the
            OpenOffice.org strings. The program provides a
            database-backed web-based editor, where individual
            strings can be searched for, translated and revised
            (marked being good and appropriate) by the registered
            translators. The program was written in the popular PHP
            web programming language, and it is using Apache,
            PostgreSQL, and is running on Linux. The translation
            process also includes some scripts that bridge the gap
            between the web-based translation engine and the
            "standard" OpenOffice.org localization tools.<br />
             The second program has been used to translate the
            OpenOffice.org help. This tool is conceptionally
            similar to the first, but due to the different
            structure of the material to-be-translated and the
            different tools it uses (T9N toolkit), it has a
            slightly different structure which makes it worth to
            present this separately.<br />
             And last, there is an idea for an interactive, client
            program, which can "look up" the message string on the
            screen under the mouse cursor in a translation
            database, and by identifying it, it can provide access
            to the translation allowing to modify or revise it.
            This application would radically speed up testing
            (QA-ing) a localized OpenOffice.org program.</td>

            programmer for 5-6 years now. In the past years, it was
            an honor for me to take part in two Hungarian civil
            societies, the "LME" (Association of Hungarian Linux
            Users), founded in 1998, and the "FSF.hu Foundation for
            Propagating and Supporting Free Software in Hungary". I
            am using Linux at home and at work, which implies that
            I needed a good Office product for writing documents,

            needs, and I've been using it for two years now.
            OpenOffice.org localization in Hungary has been lacking
            (at least localization of the "GPL" version, as a
            commercial OOo-based product is available for money),
            that is why I was happy to be an organizer of the 2002
            OOo-localization marathon, during which a group of 150
            people localized all the approx. 21 thousand strings in

             The Debian team, and several other distributors, have
            been providing their own packages of OpenOffice.org for
            their system. The source is modified to integrate
            better with the native package management, as well as
            taking into account constraints put on the packages by
            the rest of the system, including components with
            restricted licensing such as the GPC library and the
            JDK. The methods used to overcome these problems will
            be covered, as well as the concepts behind the extra
            features such as language packs, auto user install,
            language fallbacks and managing three different
            architectures. There are several tools and resources

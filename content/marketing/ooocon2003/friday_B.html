		The spirit of OpenSource together with the features
		of a high professional office software package has
		tremendously increased the interest in StarOffice
		or OpenOffice.org for a huge amount of companies
		all over the world. For the first time there
		is a real alternative office software available on
		the market, compatibly running on all common operating systems.
		<br>
		For most companies the introduction of StarOffice means
		an opportunity and a challenge at the same time. On the
		one hand there is the tempting offer of an advantageous
		license model, on the other hand one should consider
		the investment in time and efforts migration brings about.
		<br>
		Therefore, the first step should be an migration study,
		concerning the Total Cost of Ownership and
		Return on Investment (TCO+ROI) for such a mission.
		<br>
		This presentation focuses on the key issues
		of an appropriate TCO and ROI analysis for a
		successful StarOffice migration project. 
		<br>
		The practical experiences of .riess as Sun's
		first StarOffice Migration Partner in Germany offers
		precious guidance in your considerations in
		introducing StarOffice.

              Those attempting to implement open source software
              solutions in the current software environment find
              themselves with daunting obstacles. The Microsoft
              muscle influences governments around the world
              through its lobbying power. Microsoft's massive
              advertising campaigns tell people that Microsoft is a
              soft and fuzzy butterfly, and is innovative in its
              development of software. The facts are that they are
              a brutal monopolistic business, and have never
              created anything close to a visionary product.<br />
               In spite of the problems in dealing with Micorosoft,
              there are slow and timid adopters in organizations
              who, although they are aware of the problems with
              Microsoft, are not irritated enough to leave their
              dank Microsoft cafeteria and have a bite from the
              smorgasborge of the alternatives, however savory
              those alternatives might be.<br />
               What makes organizations and people timid in
              migrating to Linux desktops?<br />
               Fear of losing functionality, fear of not being able
              to work as easily with others as they currently do,
              fear of spending money and time learning new
              software, fear of losing their existing work because
              they can't use it with the new tools, and fears of
              being hamstrung in different ways than they have by
              Microsoft.<br />

                <li>Easy to back out of an application at no

            diverse population, majority of whom are excluded from
            the productive usage of information technology due to
            the lack of standardized and economical Indian language
            enabled software.<br />
             OpenOffice.org is the leading office productivity
            suite through open-source initiatives, available with a
            rich feature set across all main platforms, along with
            internationalization and localization support for major
            International languages. This paper examines the
            development aspects, usage and prospects of
            OpenOffice.org internationalized and localized to cater
            to the Indian market.<br />
             Most Indian scripts originate from the Brahmi script
            and follow complex rules of layout involving
            consonants, vowels, special symbols, conjuncts and
            ligatures. Unicode encoding for Indian languages
            establishes a similar pattern among the scripts. In
            this paper, we will examine this pattern and how the
            orthographic rules can be used to develop Complex Text
            Layout algorithms for Indian scripts. Also explored are
            storage and rendering aspects of Indian text, along
            with font technologies suitable for Indian
            scripts.<br />
             The Internationalization(i18n) and Localization(l10n)
            framework of OpenOffice.org sets guidelines for
            localization and internationalization work of the suite
            in other languages. The project
            <a href="http://www.ncb.ernet.in/bharateeyaoo">BharateeyaOO.o</a>
            commenced on the lines of these frameworks, to achieve
            Indian language support in OpenOffice.org. With
            initiatives for localizations in major languages of
            India, Complex Text Layout support, Indian locales,
            dictionary support and collation algorithms, the
            project aims at a completely "Indianized" office suite
            packaged economically for the Indian user. This paper
            concludes with an insight into the development,
            implementation details and progress of this

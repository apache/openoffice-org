            in order to allow the authors to structure their

             It is neccessary to prepare documents that way,

            afterwards. The XML document than is an instance of the
            xDiML.DTD (DissertationMarkupLanguage). This DTD has
            been developed within several electronic publishing
            projects at Humboldt-University.<br />
             Since 1997 an SGML/XML- based concept for the long
            term preservation of digital publications has been
            used, in order to store digital documents in an media
            neutral archival format, to use the possibilities of a
            structered retrieval within the semantic structures of
            documents, and to enable an automated production of
            different information products (like PDF format for
            print, HTML for WWW layout, metadata for use within
            different retrieval networks).<br />
             In order to increase the efficiency of OpenOffice.org with
            its end format XML, a document style sheet and a filter
            for Openoffice.org was developed at the Computer- and Media
            Service of Humboldt- University. Authors are enabled to
            write their digital dissertation using this document
            style sheet and to save those within an XML based

              We describe and demonstrate tools employing
              OpenOffice.org to generate reusable and exchangeable
              learning-materials.<br />
               We developed an open framework for documents in
              educational applications based on the requirements of
              the "ITO" (Information Technology Online) project
              which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of
              Education and Research" (BMBF). The project partners
              decided to keep their well-known authoring tools
              (OpenOffice.org, Microsoft Word, Adobe FrameMaker,
              LaTeX, etc.), but we wanted to have an open document
              standard in order to make exchange and reuse of newly
              generated and existing content feasible. Thus, based
              on the profound import/export capabilities of
              OpenOffice.org, we developed solutions to support
              this task.<br />
               Our first approach handles the transformation of
              text documents (OpenOffice.org Writer, Microsoft
              Word, RTF, etc.) into a hierarchical structured set
              of learning objects. The other one deals with slide
              presentations as generated by OpenOffice.org Impress
              and Microsoft PowerPoint.<br />
               Handling of text documents:<br />
               To satisfy all requirements of our courseware system
              there is a special need to differentiate between
              structure, content and layout. The OpenOffice.org
              XMLdocument format provides a starting point for a
              transformation, which fulfills these needs. To
              identify the semantics, structure and metadata of the
              content to be processed, we have defined a set of
              style templates. E.g. we defined paragraph styles
              like "introduction", "motivation", "definition",
              "rights", "example" etc. and text styles like
              "keyword", "index", "reference", "citation",
              "significant" etc. Those paragraph styles appear in
              the "content.xml" file of the OpenOffice.org file format.
              Together with the embedded information provided by
              the use of those template we are able to transform
              conforming documents to our intermediate
              format.<br />
               Converting slide presentations to SVG:<br />
               Slide presentations are the most commonly used media
              to present lecture material today. Thus, a huge
              amount of time has already been invested to generate
              this material. This effort must be preserved when
              assembling online courseware. Seamless transformation
              to a web-enabled format is the key issue here. To
              handle the different formats and features such as
              animations and navigation within the repository the
              presentations have to be transformed into SVG, the
              upcoming W3C standard for two-dimensional graphics in
              the web. OpenOffice.org allows the export of slides into
              SVG. Unfortunately, the export of only one slide at a
              time is possible from the user interface. External
              tools must be used for scripting this behavior and
              other issues concerning font handling and animations
              must be addressed. We implemented the following
              features in our slide exporting tool which is based
              on Java and uses OpenOffice.org's SDK and the UNO
              interface: 

              <ul>
                <li>Export of the complete presentation</li>

                <li>Adding navigation and index mechanisms</li>

                <li>Preliminary support for animations</li>

                <li>Correction of glyph spacing issues</li>

                <li>On-the-fly embedding of non-standard fonts</li>
              </ul>We have shown that OpenOffice.org supports an
              integrated platform for open courseware management
              and document transformations. We have implemented a
              utility for transforming appropriately structured
              OpenOffice.org documents to our XML-based intermediate
              courseware format. An additional utility allows the
              automatic conversion of slide presentations into the
              SVG format, thus alleviating the need for manual
              conversion of proprietary documents.

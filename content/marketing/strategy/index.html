    <h1>Strategic Marketing Plan</h1>

    <h2>Why does OpenOffice.org need a Strategic Marketing
    Plan?</h2>

    <p>Since its inception, the Marketing Project has seen an
    amazing amount of creativity, discussion, and actual
    achievement. However, there have been frequent complaints that
    there has been no overall framework or context for this
    activity. This means it's not easy for newcomers to see where
    they can find a niche and make a contribution. There's also a
    danger that the same debates are repeated, rather than reaching
    an agreed position and being able to develop ideas in
    depth.</p>

    <p>In 2004, the Project Leads decided to facilitate the
    development of a Marketing Strategy and a high-level Plan to
    give focus and direction to the work of the project. This work
    created the Strategic Marketing Plan.</p>

    <h2>What did people say about the Plan?</h2>

    <p>The press gave the publication of the draft plan a good - if
    somewhat suprised - reaction. See:</p>

    <h2>How was the Plan built?</h2>

    <p>The Plan was built in four stages:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>A limited number of key players in the Marketing Project
      prepared a draft. This work was carried out by the <a href=
      "http://marketing.openoffice.org/contacts.html">MarCons</a> -
      people recognised in the Project as having special expertise
      in a particular marketplace, and who would have a special
      role in delivering the Plan</li>

      <li>The draft was taken to <a href=
      "http://marketing.openoffice.org/conference/">OOoCon2004</a>
      - an ideal opportunity to <a href=
      "http://marketing.openoffice.org/strategy/ooocon2004/">present
      the plan</a>, get real discussions around a table and get
      instant feedback on whether the Plan was on the right
      lines.</li>

      <li>Further discussions took place with the wider
      community</li>

      <li>The Plan was moved to <a href=
      "http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Strategic_Marketing_Plan">
      the wiki</a> to allow it to become a living doucment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Where can I find the Plan?</h2>

    <p>Version 0.5 of the Plan was released at OOoConf 2004:</p>

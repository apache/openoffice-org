<p><h3>Notes:</h3><br>
The next stage of the workshop took a very quick look at the OpenOffice.org Community, the product, and its target markets. Participants were asked to vote on a show of hands:<br>
<br>
1=Poor<br>
5=Excellent<br>
<br>
for each of the ten items shown on the slide. From this emerged a view as to whether each factor was a <i>strength</i> or a <i>weakness</i> for OpenOffice.org.<br>
<br>
Overall, the OpenOffice.org product was judged to be in a stronger position than the Community. <br>
<br>
It says something for the overall optimism of the participants that 3.5 seemed to be the most common score...<br>

<h1><b>Target Markets</b></h1><p>
<br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
A market is a group of users with similar needs. By matching OpenOffice.org's benefits to market needs we can see how well we serve a market.<br>
<br>
Doing the same exercise for competitive products shows which markets we serve better than our competitors. These are potential target markets.<br>
<br>
For example, <br>
let's assume the Competitor on the slide is taken as MS-Office<br>
the the balloon on the bottom right of the slide represents Linux users who require a comprehensive office product<br>
the the diagram shows only OpenOffice.org will meet their needs<br>
<br>
Commercial companies also require a market to be potentially profitable before it becomes a target market. OpenOffice.org does not necessarily suffer from this limitation. For example, there is no reason why OpenOffice.org should not be localised into a language with a very small number of speakers, provided there are willing and able volunteers to do the work.<br>

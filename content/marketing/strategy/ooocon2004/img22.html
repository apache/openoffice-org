<p><h3>Notes:</h3><br>
The Workshop had explored the strategy development process in a very rapid and time-constrained fashion. However, for the past few months this process had been taking place 'for real' on a discussion list used by the MarCons - Marketing Contacts - people within the Marketing Project with responsibility for particular geographical or other markets.<br>
<br>
From this activity the Project Leads have created a series of draft Strategic Marketing Plans. These had now reached the 0.5 release - the half way stage to the final version.<br>
<br>
The Workshop at OOoConff marked the official release of 0.5 to the Community for a full Community debate, with the intention of having the 1.0 release approved by the Community Council by the end of 2004.<br>
<br>
The early stages of this process concentrate on getting the strategy right; once this is agreed, the later stages will focus more on how to implement it.<br>

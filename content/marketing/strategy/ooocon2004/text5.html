<h1><b>Features and Benefits</b></h1><p>
<ul><li><h2>Features: &quot;things&quot; we build into OOo or provide as a Community</h2>
<li><h2>Benefits: the value this brings to the user</h2>
<li><h2>For example:</h2>
<ul><li><i>Feature: Open-source licence</i>
<li><i>Benefit: you can pass copies on to friends, family, students, employees... (legitimately!)</i>
<li><i></i>
</ul><li><h2>Users do not choose OOo for its <i>features</i>...</h2>
<li><h2>...they use it for the <i>benefits</i> it brings</h2>
</ul><br>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
Features and Benefits is a key marketing concept. <br>
<br>
In the Community we are often pre-occupied with product features - will this particular 'feature' make its way into the next release.<br>
<br>
From a user's perspective, a 'feature' has to pass the 'so what' test before it brings them any benefit:<br>
<br>
Feature: OpenOffice.org has an open-source licence<br>
<i>So What?</i><br>
Benefit: you can give it away to other people<br>

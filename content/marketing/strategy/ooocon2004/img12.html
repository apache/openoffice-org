<p><h3>Notes:</h3><br>
A Strategic Plan also has to look to the future - say for the next five years. To give shape to these forecasts, the Strategic Marketing Plan adopted the well-known STEP factors model (sometimes also called PEST).<br>
<br>
It is important to note that each one of these factors could be either a <i>threat</i> or an <i>opportunity</i> for OpenOffice.org.<br>
<br>
Some factors could be both - for example, the aggressive pursuit of IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) by COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) vendors could be:<br>
<br>
<i>opportunity</i> - people with unlicensed software could be tempted to migrate to open-source<br>
<i>threat</i> - people could be unwilling to move to open-source in case they fall foul of patent claims in the future<br>

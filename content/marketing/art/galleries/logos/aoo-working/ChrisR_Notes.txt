Notes by Chris Rottensteiner 2013-06-07 - chrisr D0T gen ÄT gmail D0T com
Done with Inkscape 0.48.4 on Win
Contributors/Inspiration: Kevin Grignon, Rob Weir, AOO community, v3 Logo
Font family: Source Sans Pro (fonts converted to paths)
Logo was tested rudimentary for different screen sizes and greyscale. Further tiny refinement especially for pixel version possible. 
White space around the logo is important. If possible it should be mantained in every use of the logo. 

Some comments to explain the logo history and creation (see also mailing list)
- 4 should only be used in the v4 Version splash screens etc. .
- "globe with birds" could be increased another bit, but not much; otherwise I think the globe is too dominant. 
- regarding "Apache" I have aligned it with "pen" under it. I also think the p descender is not negative in my version and in any case like it more as the capital form. So the only option for changement would be to make the color darker or the font heavier. I have tried both, but I like my current version and even in smallest sizes Apache to me is not less readable then other variants, where Apache has the same proportion regarding OpenOffice. 
- regarding the ligature ffi: like expressed in another thread I have done the ff ligature manually in Inkscape, but I don't like the i point merged in to the f and my distance "ff" to "i" was choosen carefully, but I'm open to proposals how to design the ligature.ffi. 
- We could change the font for Apache to a sligtly thicker variant, but I would prefer to not have to much dominant words: Apache OpenOffice is long and my first proposal started only with the "globe with birds" and Office. I would like to retain some of the idea to have a short word brand or at least not dominant additional words.

			Project Summary

	<tr>
		<td>
		The OpenOffice.org Art Project wants to provide a central repository for OpenOffice.org related artwork 
		where you may get all the graphics you need to promote our product and our community. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		It's our firm conviction that OpenOffice.org will profit from a strong visual identity in public.
		Therefore we provide officially approved artwork to be used wherever applicable.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		Designers and artists interested in creating OpenOffice.org related artwork may find here graphical means to ease their work, 
		and if they like to share their work with the community they can upload it in order to get it included in our gallieries.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		As major parts of the OpenOffice.org community are speaking languages different from English 
		we invite the Native-Language projects to share their artwork with others via our galleries. We help to translate the artwork
		presented here in English and other languages. Just subscribe to our mailing list and ask for advice.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		To achieve these objectives we're always looking for people interested in artwork and willing to contribute to our project.
		We work jointly on new artwork, create graphic aids, style guides, provide this website with it's galleries and 
		even if it is a serious task we have lot of fun!

Here are a few areas where help is currently needed:
<ol>

<li> <strong>Update <a href="to-do-artwork.html">artwork to-do</a>:</strong> 
<br>by inluding tasks which belong to artwork and which currently can be found in 
<a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/todos.html">Marketing Project's To-Do</a> list. 
<br><br>

<li> <strong>Update artwork categories list:</strong> 
<br>Right now, the <a href="index.html#galleries">galleries index</a> contains only a few categories of artwork. 
We need to identify other categories and create the corresponding galleries.
<br><br>

<li> <strong>Index existing artwork in galleries:</strong><br>
Existing artwork is spread accross Community sites and Projects, including the Native Lang projects.
<br>We need to index in our galleries the existing work so that everybody can look in a single place for OpenOffice.org related graphics.
<br><br>

<li> <strong>Translate artwork from other languages into English</strong> in order to be used by other projects.<br>
How it is done: Index the original graphics in the corresponding category but with the translation text mentioned in HTML near the image.
<br><br>

<li> <strong>OpenOffice.org Visual Identity Manual</strong> needs to be finalized in order to have a unified
specifications set for the artists who enroll in creating artwork for OpenOffice.org 
<br><br>

<li> <strong>Advertise the project</strong> on general and other projects mailing lists. This is a periodical task 
in order to attract visitors to the galleries and to direct the artwork requests to the project.
</ol>


Please do not hesitate to ask for details or guidance on our <a href="about-participation.html">mailing list</a> 
if you feel you can help<br>

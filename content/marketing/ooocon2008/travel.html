    <h2>Registration FAQs</h2>

    <p>Q: I have joined the 'pre-registration survey'. Do I now need to
    register?<br />
    A: Yes please, the pre-registration was needed to get first estimates of
    the number of attendees we can expect. As well, we wanted to kick-off the
    visa process early.</p>

    <p>Q: I am a speaker at the OOoCon. Do I need to register?<br />
    A: Yes please, registration will ask for some additional information.</p>

    <p>Q: I was informed, that I will receive a travel subsidy to be able to
    join OOoCon in Beijing. Do I need to register?<br />
    A: Yes, the registration will ask for some additional information.</p>

    <p>Q: I was informed, that I will receive a travel subsidy to be able to
    join the OOoCon in Beijing and sent a note, that I will be able to take
    advantage of the bursary. Do I need to register?<br />
    A: Yes, the registration for the OOoCon and confirming the acceptance of
    the bursary are two different things.</p><!--
    <p>Q: I was informed, that I will receive a travel subsidy to be able to
    join the OOoCon in Beijing, but the registration form is asking for my
    room price limit. What shall I do?<br />
    A: Just leave this information open, the form can be submitted without
    choosing a room price limit.</p>

    <p>Q: I do not yet know my exact travel dates. Shall I wait with the
    registration until I can state them clearly?<br />
    A: No, to get the mainly the visa process going, we would like to ask
    anyone to register as early as possible. For the travel dates, please
    enter the arrival and departure days, that you are planning for.</p>

    <p>Q: Is the tourist tour on Saturday and Sunday the same or are these
    different ones?<br />
    A: Both dates will have different programs. The sites planned to visit so
    far are: Great Wall, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, Lama Temple, Temple
    of Heaven. That's definitely too much for one day.</p>

    <h2>Travel costs</h2>

    <p>Price reference by recent samples: Europe 600 € – 1000 €, US/Canada
    East coast 1000 € - 1300 €, US/Canada West coast 800 € - 1200 €, Cape
    Town 800 € - 1400 €, Tokyo 400 € - 600 €, Sydney 1000 € - 1400 €.</p>

    <p>The organizers will also do their best to organize discounted group
    flights from Europe.</p>

    <p><em>Update 25th August: negotiations for discounted flight tickets are
    now ended without any results. We were not able to provide accurate data
    about number and origin of the attendees to the air lines in order to
    raise their interest and get good quotations. Meanwhile the situation has
    changed significantly and that's the good news. Several airlines have
    regular offers now, that are at the level the organisers had planned to
    reach with the negotiations, means between 500 and 600 Euro. Price tips
    for the moment are Finnair (499), Air France (555), British Airways (575)
    and KLM (580). Lufthansa is quite expensive in the moment, but typically
    they have better offers about four weeks before traveling: take this
    advice at your own risk! For Air China prices, try their European call
    center at 00800 86 100 999.</em></p>

    <h2>Help with travel and accomodation</h2>

    <p>The organizers will offer financial assistance to significant
    contributors to the Community who would not be able to attend OOoCon in
    Beijing by their own means. The final extent of this programme will
    depend on the generosity of the conference sponsors, but premilinary
    plans are to offer free hotel accomodation in a conference hotel plus a
    500 € travel subsidy.</p>

        within the Public Sector ICT framework in providing efficient, secure
        and quality services. MAMPU was tasked to establish and operate the
        Open Source Competency Centre (OSCC), which is the single point of
        reference to guide, facilitate, coordinate and monitor implementation
        of OSS in the Public Sector. OpenOffice.org is a key component of the

        <p class="title">The full adoption of OOo in the Cambodian education
        System</p>

        <p class="by">KHENG Piseth, KHOEM Sokhem ( / KhmerOS)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> The Cambodian Ministry of Education mandated,
        in january 2008, that all public educational institutions must use -
        for teaching the use of computers - OpenOffice in Khmer language. The
        announcement was done together with the presentation of the new
        official ICT textbook of the Ministry, which mainly teaches
        OpenOffice (together with other FOSS programs). The 350-page
        full-color textbook has been one of the key factors that have led to
        adoption of OpenOffice. It has been the last of a number of actions
        that have led to the end. As the Ministry of Education is concerned,
        OpenOffice started to exist in 2004, when it included the use of FOSS
        as part of its "ICT for Education" policy, as an effect of lobbying
        from the KhmerOS project, which was at that time translating
        OpenOffice to Khmer. For two years, OpenOffice started being used
        non-officially in many of the schools. As it was the only software in
        Khmer language, it was easy for the teachers to teach it. The KhmerOS
        project provided tranining materials (slides), but lack of LCD
        projectors forced teachers to use their own methodology. In 2007 the
        Ministry and the Open Institute (NGO that houses the KhmerOS project)
        signed an agreement to work together to develop ICT in Education and
        to write together a 5-year Master Plan for the implementation of ICT
        in Education. The Master Plan is still in the process of being
        written, but the close cooperation, together with the ICT Textbook
        (developed and distributed free of charge to all schools by the Open
        Institute), together with a campaign to train all the ICT teachers in
        all upper secondary schools created sufficient trust in the Ministry
        to mandate the change to OpenOffice. The keys to this sucess have
        been: close cooperation with the Ministry, working on policy from the
        beginning, development the training materials, doing teacher
        training, and integration of this work with the needs of the Ministry
        and the country. Another key factor has been having donor countries
        (Spain and Germany) that have funded salaries and book printing.</p>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> The Spanish Government and also several
        regional governments in Spain use and support OpenOffice.org in the
        Public Administration. That creates a very interesting ecosystem of
        companies and volunteers that are working together to create several
        different versions of OOo to suit the needs of each Spanish
        community. Among them, the Catalan Translation team, leaded by JesÃºs
        Corrius, has distributed more than 2 million copies of OpenOffice.org
        during the last 8 years. In the session, I'll give an update of the
        status of the OpenOffice.org Community in Spain and also try to
        explain the success of the Catalan Translation team.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> The initiative to adopt BrOffice.org in Brazil
        began in 2004, when the Free Software adoption effort started inside
        the Brazilian Federal Government. The goal was to migrate all types
        of software, both desktops and servers. Beyond that initiative, other
        approaches began, like standardizing of documents' formats, but the
        process revealed itself as extremely slow and with collateral
        results: the low level of satisfaction after migrations and for
        various factors the inability to fulfil the basic requirements. This
        year, the Brazilian Federal Government organized the Free Software
        Implantation Committee, which is responsible for the definition of
        the strategies to effective migrate. The main initiative detected by
        this committee to consolidate de process is the adoption of
        BrOffice.org. This work presents the migration success cases of
        different federal departments with their interactions with the
        community and the building of a market inside Brazil, the strategies
        adopted by those departments and their concerns regarding the
        sustainability of Br/OpenOffice.org project. Besides that, it also
        tries to present the Committee actions, its planning and strategies,
        side by side with the BrOffice.org and ODF Alliance community
        activities inside Brazil to create an ideal environment for that
        migration, such as, amongst other, standardization of ODF at ABNT
        (Brazilian Organization of Standards), work of the BrOffice.org user
        groups in the various states to encourage the creation of laws
        supporting ODF, not only in the states but also for the whole
        country.</p>

        <p class="title">Visualize Writer Document Structure for Productive
        Development</p>

        <p class="by">Jian Hong,Cheng (STAFF SOFTWARE ENGINEER/Technical
        Leader / IBM)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This presentation introduces a tool that can be
        used to picture the node types and structure,frame types and
        structure, portion types, and other data relations information in an
        OpenOffice writer document. Because of plentiful data types and
        complicated relations in a writer document,developers are easily
        plunged into disordered situations when tracing them and their
        relations. Under certain scenarios,when operating these complex
        contents,the nodes structure or frame structure or data relations may
        be damaged unexpectedly,which lead to serious problems. And
        generally,these problems are difficult to solve. For example,when
        opening a given special document,and doing the addition/deletion
        operations for the text of "End of Footnote" and "Start of next
        page",Writer will meet serious problem. The reason is that the sample
        file has an abnormal setting about footnote height. The height of
        footnote is set to be a pretty tiny value: ?0.2? inch which may not
        be high enough to contain a single normal text string. This setting
        makes a huge barrier when formatting the document content, and
        also,this document is displayed in a very strange way. For
        example,each footnote can not be displayed in its own page, but in
        the following page. In this case,if the text input into the text
        field of "End of Footnote" or "Start of next page" is too long and
        can not be displayed totally in a single page, it has to be spanned
        to cross pages when formatting. Actually,the process will not affect
        the document nodes structure. During said formatting process,all
        footnotes will be reorganized within multi-frames. In order to deal
        with the multi-lines of the footnote, a method named
        SwFlowFrm::PasteTree(...) will be executed to connect all text
        strings inside a single footnote. Please refer to the code segment.
        ... else { if ( 0 == (pStart-&gt;pPrev = pParent-&gt;Lower()) )
        pParent-&gt;pLower = pStart; else pParent-&gt;Lower()-&gt;pNext =
        pStart; } ... Said code will move a sub tree whose root is ?pStart?
        into the node ?pParent? as a child. If the "pParent" does not have
        any child,the "pStart" will be the only child of it. And if the
        "pParent" has already a child, the "pStart" will be the sibling
        child. But if the "pParent" has more than one child nodes,the former
        child node and its sibling nodes will lost their relationships to the
        whole tree. Thus,any modification of the tree will not affect the
        former child node and its sibling nodes any more. In this case, the
        content of the ?pParent? will be moved backward again and then, the
        "pParent" will be destructed later. Because the relationship of said
        nodes are lost, there will be no any operation happening on those
        said nodes. So the upper node pointer of such nodes is still pointing
        to the memory where the ?pParent? has been in. A dangling pointer
        appears. Serious problem will happen at any time. When facing such
        serious problems appeared during document formatting,developers have
        to make the data structure and relations clear first,and then plunge
        into code ocean to trace the complex formatting process step by
        step,that's a real big headache and will take too much time. And
        now,with the help of this tool,developers can easily make the data
        structure and relations clear and catch the destroyed data and
        certain structure difference changed within certain
        process,especially such as formatting process,undo/redo process and
        so on. Thus,developers are able to find out the root cause quickly
        and work out solution in time. This tool makes Writer developers more
        productive. Simultaneously,the development of the tool and real
        example details will also be introduced in this presentation.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> OpenOffice.org is looking for some time now for
        a new SCM (Source configuration management) tool to replace CVS. Due
        to the rapid changes in the SCM tooling landscape over the last years
        there is no obvious best replacement for CVS; at least four SCM tools
        (Bazaar, Git, Mercurial and Subversion) emerged as serious candidates
        for hosting the OOo source code repository. The OOo engineering
        steering committee decided to migrate to Subversion first but to
        re-evaluate the three DSCM systems within a year to account for new
        developments. This presentation will discuss the current state of the
        SCM migration project.</p>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Producing Windows OOo builds is very painful -
        not everyone has that operating system, setting up the build
        environment for OOo is non-trivial, and the build takes too long. On
        the other hand, the Windows builds are essential, far too many users
        demand them, and also they are necessary for the QA purposes. This
        session will discuss the possibilities to cross-compile the OOo on
        Linux using the free (as in free beer) Microsoft compiler in Wine,

        <p class="by">André Schnabel (project member / supervisory board
        member / OOo Germanophone project / OpenOffice.org DEutshcland
        e.V.)</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Funding the project is a topic which has been
        (and will be) discussed for several years. As the project is growing
        (in numbers and in activities) funds will get even more important. As
        the project itself is no legal entity, we need structures to support
        funds. The presentation is going to show the ways we currently have
        for funding the project and how we can find new ways. The
        presentation will be held from my perspective as a community member,
        as well as founding member of the German association "OOo Deutschland
        e. V." - presenting our work and problems and how we try to cooperate
        with other associations to fund the OpenOffice.org project. Aim of
        the presentation is to get to know the associations that exist
        worldwide for supporting OOo and develop ideas how to make our work
        more efficient.</p>

        <p><em>Biography:</em> I'm professional developer, based in Germany.
        I'm involved in the OOo project since 2002 taking several roles
        (Co-Lead of the Germanophone project, Lead of QA project, member of
        the Community Council). As founding member of OOo Deutschland e.V. I
        made several experiences about the problem but also the joy of
        founding the project.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Recent articles about "ODF as the winning
        format", critical voices to Microsoft's Format, schools of poor
        countries being able to offer Office-education to new generations
        because of OpenOffice.org.. We are making an important difference to
        the way the future will look for some people. I believe many of us
        doesn't realize how amazingly big this movement really is. This was
        what made me come up with the idea. - Short interviews of people from
        third-world countries. To hear what OpenOffice.org really means for
        them. - Presentation of news-texts, to find indicators with which
        help we might draw conclusions about OOo's future position, on a
        global-view.</p>

        <p class="by">Martin Damboldt (Program Manager / Sun Microsystems

      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Often registration rings a bell for people and
        has some kind of bad touch. The Service Tag based registration
        support we use in OpenOffice.org is anything else than evil. The
        whole OpenOffice.org Project can massively benefit from the outcomes
        we gather by registrations. Some key aspects and important items and
        features will be highlighted. Give an over view about OpenOffice.org
        registration. Show benefits in relation to product development,
        optimization, feedback channels. Demonstration of Google Maps ("Pink

        <p class="by">Suarez-Potts, Louis (Community Manager / Sun
        Microsystems, Inc.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> How can we get OpenOffice taught in schools? I
        mean not only the teaching of courses for users but also and perhaps
        more fundamentally important, the teaching of coding OpenOffice.org.
        Engaging students (and also instructors and professors) in coding
        OpenOffice.org in the formal environment of a secondary and
        post-school sounds promising?after all, we all recognize the value
        that students currently bring to OpenOffice.org and Foss in general,
        and we also all probably believe that by engaging students we can
        help build the future we want. (It goes without saying that just
        about every enterprise believes the same and many have significantly
        funded education efforts throughout the world.) If the why seems
        clear enough, the how remains a lot more murky. This presentation
        examines what OpenOffice.org and other Foss projects have been doing
        and evaluates the efforts. My interest is pragmatic: which efforts
        have resulted in contributors (of all levels) coming to
        OpenOffice.org and other projects?</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Free/Libre/Open Source Software developer
        communities are growing around the world. Most code is still written
        in Western Europe and North America, but a large and increasing
        amount of developers are contributing from Asia - especially China,
        India and Japan; Latin America and even Africa. The FLOSSWorld
        conducted the first large, multi-lingual survey of developers,
        businesses, universities and governments covering 8 countries in
        Asia, Latin America and Africa, along with a detailed comparison of
        regional and national collaborative development platforms, mailing
        lists, projects and communities. It turns out that FLOSS developers
        are very similar wherever in the world they live.</p>

        <p><em>Biography:</em> Rishab Aiyer Ghosh first developed and sold
        free software in 1994. He switched from writing in C and assembly to
        English, and has been writing about the economics of free software
        and collaborative production since 1994. He is Founding International
        and Managing Editor of First Monday, the most widely read
        peer-reviewed on-line journal of the Internet, and Senior Researcher
        and Head of the Collaborative Creativity Group at MERIT, at the
        United Nations University in Maastricht, the Netherlands. In 1997, he
        co-authored tools to measure contributions by free software
        developers by analysing source code, pioneering now widely used
        research techniques. In 2000 he coordinated the European Union
        -funded FLOSS project, the most comprehensive early study of
        free/libre/open source users and developers. He is involved in
        government policy initiatives on free software and open standards,
        and conducts research funded by the European Union and the US
        National Science Foundation. In January 2007, the European Commission
        published a major study led by him on the impact of open source on
        the economy, competitiveness and innovation. Since 2005 Rishab has
        been board member of the Open Source Initiative.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> The activity to improve the often requested
        Notes functionality in Writer was somehow special: including major
        community involvement. The software development was done by a student
        initially sponsored in the Google Summer of Code and the User
        Experience (UX) was mainly represented by a volunteer; both being
        supported by Sun employees. *** This case study wants to shed some
        light on the development of the Notes and how to overcome the main
        challenge - pure remote collaboration. With tools like wiki or mail
        we structured ideas, collected requirements, developed design
        proposals and discussed issues. *** So, how far did we get? What have
        we learned during our cooperation? What worked well what not? We want
        to share with the community the experience we gathered. And we want
        to show what interesting ideas are still there to further improve the
        Notes after OpenOffice.org 3.0 being released.</p>

        <p><em>Biography:</em> Besides studying computer engineering in
        Germany, Max Odendahl started working for OOo development in Summer
        07 with GSoC and has stayed ever since and developed the new Notes2.
        *** After supporting OOo for years, Christoph Noack joined the Notes2
        activity being the UX representative. The rest of his spare time is
        spent as Co-Lead of the UX project. His normal job is also in the
        field of Human Machine Interaction, but this case he works for the
        automotive industry. *** Christian Jansen is an User Experience

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This topic will give a description about
        Symphony Properties Sidebar, from what it is like and how it is
        implemented. In normal ways, when a user wants to do some properties
        changes to an object, he/she need select the object, find the menu
        and open the related dialogue, go through the attributes, change and
        apply. Why not collect users' most common used operations and make
        them docked at the first sight so that he/she can operate the at the
        most convenience? That's what Symphony Properties Sidebar aims at. It
        covers text properties, paragraph properties, shape properties, cell
        properties, graphic properties and page properties... For those items
        not so common used, sidebar provides "All Properties" button at the
        end of the panel. Click the button will bring up the whole set model
        dialogue Through the Properties Sidebar, users can change the
        object's properties by minimized clicks. It gets very positive
        feedback and will have much more rich content in the future. In the
        topic, there will be also some implementation details. It combines
        docking window and infobox's technology. Also it enhanced existing
        docking window, from visual, layout, to window management styles. The
        structure of the sidebar panel and the message delivering mechanism
        between documents and sidebar will be presented.</p>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Office Application, with document, spreadsheet,
        and presentation support, always provides thousands of features. This
        brings great challenge to office product development focus and office
        suite UX design. Therefore Office application manufacturers haves
        program, like MS CEIP to investigate on office feature., while
        However those programs need great quite much cost and not all the
        users are willing to participate. This presentation will give another
        approach on office feature survey from information stored office
        documents themselves. Comparing to other office feature survey, it's
        a cheaper and but also effective way. This approach intends to takes
        large quantity of office documents from internet as sample file sets,
        detaches document element usage information from them, and analyses
        those information to get document element statistic for office
        feature usage frequency, and the correlation between feature and
        documents sets. we have got some valuable conclusion to show in the
        presentation. In this presentation, a plug-in live demo based on IBM
        Lotus Symphony is to be shown on how the method works. In the last

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> IBM Lotus Symphony is a suite of
        open-standards-based office productivity tools based on Open Office.
        IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements Microsoft's
        earlier work on MSAA and fills critical accessibility API gaps in the
        MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a
        usable and accessible ODF based office suite. It is an engineered
        accessibility interface and helps provide an Assistive Technology
        (AT) access to many significantly advanced functions in rich document
        applications. The additional functionality includes support for rich
        text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large
        mainstream applications. IAccessible2 is firstly implemented in IBM
        Lotus Symphony and has already got support from the leading AT
        vendors in their screen reader software. The presentation includes:
        Symphony brief introduction and major accessibility improvements

        OpenOffice.org This session will also include a demo to illustrate
        the support from Jaws on IA2 implementation in Symphony. The demo
        will be focused on those IA2 highlighted supports compared with MS

        different in different release versions. That means if all
        improvements of performance may cancel out each other when we use
        different methods or follow different directions. OO is a huge
        software system, so we can not make it faster and faster only by
        tuning. Somewhere, we need refactor the code in a large scope. For
        refactoring and improvement follow the same direction or method we
        need measure the performance of OO in the same conditions, and
        comparing with same benchmark. This session will show some tools
        (valgrind, virtualmachine ,etc.) that can measure performance of OO

        the demand becomes higher and higher. We started our Accessibility
        efforts with OOo 1.1 by supporting the Java Accessibility API. Many
        things had changed since then. We now have native support for GNOME
        Accessibility, and also make good progress on Mac Accessibility with
        our native Mac port. The next step is to improve Windows
        Accessibility by replacing the old Java based accessibility with the
        new IAccessible2 API. Accessibility is also important for document
        formats, so we made many improvements in ODF 1.1, and are just
        evaluating the ODF 1.2 specification for Accessibility issues. The
        presentation will give you a good overview about all these

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Since early days of Mac and PC, there are
        predictions of "a new language of icons, that may succeed, where
        Esperanto has failed". Meanwhile I developed the visual grammar and
        around 1000 icon-glyphics (pixel and spline based). NOW I'd like to
        show icon-typing in OpenOffice via "Autocorrect": 1. Type "love+",
        "hug+", or "party+" and get little pictures (like emoticons). 2. Type
        "art", "architecture" or "office" and get the words together with
        pictures (as illustrations). 3. Type a short message in any spoken
        language and get the same picture language. FUTURE options and
        problems. 1. OpenOffice allows animated GIFs per "Autocorrect", but
        the icon-vocabularies are not easy to transfer as a package. 2.
        Icon-Typing is already programmed inside a font (like Arial), but
        therefore OpenOffice should enable OpenType features, like Apple
        Pages. 3. Lots of different projects could make use of icon-language
        in a text-processing program, starting with language-learning for

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This paper will present how ODF documents can
        be used in Composite Application and Mashups to create social
        collaborative applications. It will demonstrate OpenOffice derivative
        Lotus Symphony spreadsheet as composite application to dynamically
        generate spreadsheets from Notes/domino database in Lotus Notes 8.
        The composite application integrated ?on glass? enables ODF
        spreadsheets to have tabular data, associate styles, create graphical
        reports charts from Domino database in a single integrated view. The
        session will show usage of UNO, API?s to add features like drilling
        down to specific document, presence awareness and ability to chat
        enabling collaborative functionality in ODF documents. The second
        part of presentation will outline use case scenario of enabling ODF
        spreadsheets as Data Mashup to bring contextually related data from
        feeds and services. These feeds and services in an aggregated way to
        deliver new understanding of data in web enabled online spreadsheets.
        It will showcase ODFDOM API layer extensibility to create primitive
        Dojo based online Spreadsheet which then can be integrated with
        social services like profile, location and visualization service. It
        will demonstrate publishing RSS/Atom feeds from ODF spreadsheets to
        be consumed in Mashup tools enabling creation of mashups with ODF
        data. Reference:

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> The field of digital signatures is still in

        stronger encryption, and new concepts have been developed, for
        example for long-term archiving. Accordingly, legal regulations have
        developed or changed as well. Taking this into account, one needs to
        investigate if OOo's signature implementation still fits the
        requirements. Because of the diversity of regulations in different
        countries it would be useful to have pluggable signature algorithms
        in form of extensions. To achieve a seamless and homogeneous
        integration in OOo, one needs defined ways of getting access to
        dialogues, the status bar, menu items, selecting the algorithms, etc.

        Symphony</p>

        <p class="by">Guo, Yan Peng ( / IBM/Lotus Symphony)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> SMIL(Synchronized Multi-media Integration
        Language) is a standard language that is recommended by OASIS
        (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
        Standards) and also it is integrated into ODF. SMIL defines an
        XML-based language that allows authors to write interactive
        multimedia presentations. Using SMIL, an author can describe the
        temporal behaviour of a multimedia presentation with plentiful of
        animations, associate hyperlinks with media objects and describe the
        layout of the presentation on a screen. ODF uses SMIL to present the
        animation elements for slide show of presentation. This presentation
        will focus on SMIL animation, introduce the key elements and
        attributes of SMIL, what they represent, how they work, and the 5
        layer structure that recommended by OASIS for defining animation
        sequence. This presentation will also describe how to implement an
        SMIL engine by using Lotus Symphony as one example.</p>

        <p class="title">Transforming an OWL Ontology to an OpenOffice
        Document Template</p>

        <p class="by">Toussi, Massoud (Student / Lim&amp;Bio, Université
        Paris 13)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Writing a scientific paper is not a trivial
        task. Word processors help facilitating this task in many ways,
        especially in formatting the text layout and spell checking. However,
        most of word processor lack specific tools for helping authors
        organize their ideas, i.e. handle semantically their articles.
        Although in some specific domains, for exampling screen play writing,
        applications other than word processor have been developed to do
        this, unfortunately in academic writing there is still work be be
        done. Some minor tools, such as those helping authors with the
        management of bibliographic references were lacking in word
        processors even until recently, and authors had purchase separately.
        One of the most interesting aspects of OpenOffice suite for academics
        is of course its powerful bibliography management database. But
        still, it is difficult to say we can handle with ease our ideas in
        this suite. Another capability of OpenOffice is its extended use of
        XML files in Open Document Format (ODF). This is an interesting
        aspect which allows the management of the content of a document
        independently from its layout and style. The author has developed an
        ontology of a scientific article OWL language. Based on this
        ontology, named Paper Element Nodes (PEN), a scientific paper has a
        type, a style, a content, a version and a cover letter. A scientific
        paper type can be any of editorial, research paper, review article,
        case report, analysis article, methodology article, and so on. Its
        style can include layout styles, references styles, language styles,
        and illustration styles. Its the content, which conveys the core
        meaning of the article, can also be divided into several parts which
        are called nodes in our model. The main nodes of the content of a
        scientific paper include: title page, abstract, introduction,
        methods, results, discussion, tables, illustrations, legends for
        illustrations, etc. Each of these nodes are further divided into sub
        nodes. For example the title page includes the title of the article,
        author names and affiliations, author roles, acknowledgements,
        disclaimers, number of tables and illustrations, word count and the
        address of corresponding and reprints authors. All these nodes and
        their subdivisions are coded in OWL DL language in the original PEN
        ontology. During this session, the author demonstrates how these
        concepts can be directly implemented in an OpenOffice template. The
        final result will be a template document which is ready to be used
        for writing a scientific paper. This makes possible to write a
        scientific article with much less effort. As a medical informatics
        graduate, the author will demonstrate how this newly created template
        can be used to facilitate the writing of a scientific paper about a
        clinical trial study. So far, the author shows that the ODF has the
        capability of presenting a semantic structure of a scientific
        article. This is beneficial for academic writers by helping them
        prepare well-structured manuscripts. Another more important benefit
        of using this kind of ontology based template is the fact that search
        engines of tomorrow can be able to parse scientific articles in a
        semantic way. For example they will be able to search all articles
        using OpenOffice and ODF in their methods. A progress which will make
        us closer to Web 3.0 concept.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> * Although the OpenDocument (ODF) is being
        shared as file format by many applications, no common ODF test suite
        is available to test their ODF compliance. Even worse it seems not a
        single ODF test is being shared. This presentation should give
        insights what ODF test scenarios are shareable among ODF
        applications, which help to avoid reinventing the wheel, saving time
        and money and raising the overall quality level. Basics of ODF
        testing are shown, like when two ODF documents are formally equal
        according to the ODF spec. Furthermore the demand for basic tools is
        stated, where most tests will depend on. Finally providing a view
        what an ODF test suite shareable among ODF applications might look

        <p class="title">State of the Project, Year 8</p>

        <p class="by">Suarez-Potts, Louis (Community Manager / Sun
        Microsystems, Inc.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This presentation examines the state of the
        project after eight years of continued extraordinary growth and
        activity. The focus is on work that has been done in the last year,
        in particular, OpenOffice.org 3.0, and our ambitions for the coming
        year. Briefly: OpenOffice.org 3.0 represents both a cumulative
        accomplishment by the community, a peak reached after years not just
        of coding but of organization, and a point of departure. At this
        point, OpenOffice.org has reached, I believe, a status in the world
        that places it not just on equal footing with any other productivity
        suite but above. OpenOffice.org 3.0, equipped with the ODF, goes well
        beyond any single productivity suite or application; rather, it
        functions a primary star in a constellation of applications that are
        giving all users the tools and reach to do what they want, what they
        dream of. With this exuberant moment reached, what then for the
        coming year? Should we expect new features, new code? Perhaps a new
        look? This presentation will look at some suggestions, but as with
        all such presentations, the focus will be on honouring those who have
        taken us to where we are now and whose vision will take us even
        farther.</p>

        <p class="by">Cornelius, Berend (Software engineer / Sun
        Microsystems)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> The Mozilla Calendar project is an Open-Source
        project that drives the development of the standalone application
        ?Sunbird? and its counterpart ?Lightning? that can be added as an
        extension to the popular email client ?Thunderbird?. In this
        presentation I'd like to talk about the capabilities of Sunbird and
        Lightning - also in comparison to competitive applications-, about
        the current status of the project and its future perspective. Being a
        perfect appendix to OpenOffice.org I want to present ideas how the
        two projects could be linked together more tightly in the future as
        calendaring is not offered by the office suite. But this presentation
        should also address developers or other people who are interested in
        getting involved in a comparatively manageable and somehow ?familial?
        Open-Source project that yet has found a worldwide broad
        distribution. Therefore I'd like to introduce the underlying
        technologies XUL, XBL, JavaScript and explain how the Mozilla
        community is organized and what is the best way to get started.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> OOo3 now has a server! People increasingly need
        to work connected. They need to get their document reviewed,
        annotated, shared, approved by people, peers and superiors with whom
        they are working with. Yet there's no server mechanism exist today
        which would enable people to do that quickly, easily and
        conveniently. As a result, people are still working semi off-line.
        They compose their document online using OpenOffice, then they
        process it across manually, or ? at best ? circulate it via email.
        Such approach doesn't provide the complete feature nor integrated
        ?working assembly? mechanism that would make tracking, managing,
        sharing, filing, measuring and digital tracing work that has been
        done quickly, easily nor conveniently. Through its ?digital workdesk?

        perhaps could be one of the major differentiator of OpenOffice.org in
        the future compared with what Microsoft can offer with their

        Scripting Language</p>

        <p class="by">Flatscher Rony G. (Professor / Wirtschaftsuniversität
        Wien)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> This presentation introduces the OpenOffice.org
        Java based scripting framework and how it allows to add a scripting
        language of your choice to OpenOffice.org. Using the open source
        scripting framework "Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)", version 2.4,
        from the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), it becomes possible to
        bridge any of the many BSF supported scripting languages with the
        OpenOffice.org scripting framework. In effect, the combination of
        both Java-based frameworks allows to employ additional scripting
        languages as macro languages for OpenOffice.org, like Groovy, Jython
        (Python in Java), Jacl (TcL in Java), JLog (Prolog in Java) and the
        like. This presentation will use the open source scripting language
        "Open Object Rexx (ooRexx)" as a proof of concept. Using ooRexx is
        interesting for different reasons, one being, that it is implemented
        in C++ yet allows to be used via Java. Hence, the audience will learn
        that practically any scripting language could be used for
        OpenOffice.org. There will be a few, easy to understand scripting
        examples given, which demonstrate how one becomes able to remote
        control all of OpenOffice.org from any scripting language that takes
        advantage of the OpenOffice.org scripting framework. The presentation
        concludes with a possible outlook to incorporate BSF 3.0 (currently
        in beta) to OpenOffice.org. BSF 3.0 is an open source implementation
        of the JSR-223 Java standard for the Java scripting framework as
        introduced with Java 6 (1.6) by Sun. Goal: the audience should be
        able to conceptually understand the OOo Java based scripting
        framework, the BSF 2.4 scripting framework and become able to assess
        and implement new scripting languages for OpenOffice.org, including
        of how easy it is to employ those scripting languages thereafter by
        exploiting the respective OOo APIs.</p>

        for Dynamic Scripting Languages</p>

        <p class="by">Flatscher Rony G. (Professor / Wirtschaftsuniversität
        Wien )</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Adding a new dynamic scripting language to
        OpenOffice.org is possible by exploiting the Java based
        OpenOffice.org scripting framework. However, programming and
        remote-controlling OpenOffice.org with the "Unified Network Objects
        (UNO)" framework can be quite challenging. As a result, it is quite
        difficult to teach/train end-user programmers to automate
        (remote-control) the different OpenOffice.org document types.
        Therefore, OpenOffice.org dynamic scripting languages like OOo Basic
        or Python provide support for easing programming of OOo, e.g. by
        implicitly carrying out queryInterface()-calls and as such
        alleviating the (end-user) programmer from this sometimes pesky task.
        Introducing new dynamic scripting languages to OOo will most likely
        challenge the implementer for creating an appropriate scripting
        language support specifically for OpenOffice.org. This presentation
        will use the "Open Object Rexx (ooRexx)" dynamic scripting language
        as an example and discusses the many fold possibilities of creating
        support for OOo. As the author of such an OOo supporting
        infrastructure who also has been gaining experiences with end-user
        type of programmers (students at the Vienna University of Economics
        and Business Administration) for more than two years by now, the most
        important pros and cons of such a specific support will be talked and
        discussed about. Goal: the audience will learn the most important
        areas of OpenOffice.org programming for which specific support could
        and should be created for new scripting languages. However, it also
        should become aware of thinking about trade-offs between creating too
        much and too few such support.</p>

        be useful for the translator to translate the messages in that file,
        2) that it is possible to follow the localization workflow, so that
        reviewers and those who need to approve the translations know exactly
        the status of each message (if it was reviewed after its translation
        or not, etc.) largely reducing the amount of work that they have to
        do. Localization editors that use all the information stored in XLIFF
        files can help provide homogeneous translations produced by less
        experienced translators (glossary control), and workflow management,
        without having to install and maintain glossaries and TM for each
        translator, but just sending to them self-contained XLIFF files that
        can be processed by an XLIFF localization editor. These editors -
        with differentiated interfaces for translating, reviewing and
        approving messages - can help manage and simplify the localization
        workflow, and reduce the amount of work necessary for the
        localization process.</p>

        <p><em>Abstract:</em> Many languages require complex font support for
        correct rendering and non-space based line breaking. The presentation
        will demonstrate Graphite complex fonts working in OpenOffice,
        including basic support for Graphite's font features and ideas for
        how features could be included into the User Interface and the
        OpenDocument format. The publication of Unicode 5.1 in April 2008
        opened the way for Burmese and most of the other languages in Myanmar
        to be encoded in Unicode for the first time. The examples will show
        how many of these languages require reordering and context specific
        glyph substitutions. Font features allow language specific tailoring
        of glyphs for the same code sequences within a single font. Line
        breaking will also be discussed, since neither space nor syllable
        based solutions give a good results in Burmese.</p>

        around the world</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> BrOffice.org Zine is an old dream of the
        Brazilian community that, following the same line of other free
        software user groups in Brazil, has the intention to provide high
        quality material, with tutorials, use tips and news about
        OpenOffice.org on Brazil and around the world, besides the news about
        ODF. This work presents the success case of our fanzine, explaining
        steps we took while developing the project, like the study made about
        the tools to be used, the visual communication, search and content
        classification part of the work and the team management. As a basis
        for the BrOffice.org Zine's work there is a clipping, research and
        content classification process to the BrOffice.org web portal, that
        is responsible to collect informations about BrOffice.org,
        OpenOffice.org and ODF on several languages like Brazilian
        Portuguese, Portuguese, English, Spanish and galician. Beyond the
        work of developing the BrOffice.org Zine in Brazilian Portuguese, the
        fanzine was used as an anchor to bring together different communities
        like Galician and Spanish communities, which resulted in the creation
        of BrOffice.org Zine - Galicia and from starting point, became the
        idea of expanding the fanzine to other languages like French and
        German. After the project was restructured, new perspectives
        appeared. One of them was the partnership with institutions that are
        already using BrOffice.org to publish advertisements and articles,
        always related to BrOffice.org and ODF, generating financial
        sustainability to the Brazilian community and the other one is the
        idea to create a high quality graphical material to help in the
        process of support and promote Br/OpenOffice.org and ODF around the
        world.</p>

        <p class="title">Proposal: Regional Groups</p>

        <p class="by">Suarez-Potts, Louis (Community Manager / Sun
        Microsystems, Inc.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> I propose the formal creation of regional
        groups able to undertake and conduct marketing, user-group events,
        and developer and other contributor meetings. These groups would
        operate like Linux User Groups and tie into the existing MarCon
        network as well as the Native Language Confederation. The difference
        would be that these groups would not be based on language but region.
        Thus, as has already been discussed on the dev@native-lang list as
        well as the project_leads list, an Indian Regional group would
        coordinate development as well as events regardless of language. In
        the case of India, this is an especially important point, as there
        are 22 official languages. But India is not the only locale for such
        groups, and I propose setting up African, Scandinavian, Latin
        American, and Native North and Central American groups as a start.
        Similar groups in Europe, where such already exist in Spain, Germany,
        France, is welcomed. The focus, again, would encompass both marketing
        and developmental efforts. The obvious drawback of any such group
        would be coordinating their activity with the Web project. At
        present, we already see such difficulties arising from the Brazilian
        group BrOffice, and there are no doubt other instances. But by
        formalizing the idea, I anticipate we would be able to better address
        precisely this and other, related, problems. Right now, little is
        actually done beyond personal emails, and each of those takes time.
        How would these groups be established and who would lead them? These
        and other points will be discussed in the presentation.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p><em>Abstract:</em> OpenOffice.org 3.0 will be a remarkable
        milestone after long-term development of OpenOffice.org. However,
        which direction will be good for OpenOffice.org to go after that? One
        option for such consideration would possibly be: Lightweight,
        Specialized, Diversified and Individualized. Lightweight accounts for
        the isolation among modules, more logical classifications of
        fundamental and extended functions,and separation between system's
        running core and interface; Specialization encourages the research of
        deeper exploitation of each module for its corresponding application
        field and intensifOpenOffice.org's value in the data processing
        capacity for structured semi-structured data. Diversification stands
        for the grand support for multiple hardware platforms, various
        document format standards and additionally, some specific data
        processing standards, XBML, for instance. Individualization favors
        users to be dominant to choose any function sets, usage pattern and
        even differentof OpenOffice.org at their will.</p>

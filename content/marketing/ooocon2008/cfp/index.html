    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>

    <p><strong><em>Please note the Call for Papers closed on 18th
    July</em></strong></p>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Community invites potential speakers to submit
    proposals for papers for OOoCon 2008. Whether you are a seasoned
    presenter, or have never stood up in public before, if you have something
    interesting to share about OpenOffice.org - we want to hear from you.
    Please note the Conference language is English.</p>

    <h3>A unique occasion</h3>

    <p>OOoCon 2008 will see the biggest concentration of OOo developers ever
    assembled in one location on this planet. For this reason, we
    particularly welcome proposals from developers with information to share
    with fellow developers, from how to get started with simple extensions,
    through to the deep, dirty, and downright technical aspects of hacking
    the OpenOffice.org codebase.</p>

    <p>Papers are also welcomed on any topic of interest to the Community: to
    the thousands of people who have joined one of our Projects and design,
    develop, maintain, translate, test, document, support, promote, or in any
    other way help us bring OpenOffice.org's products and services to the
    world. As this is the first OOoCon to be held in Asia, we encourage local
    communities to submit papers for a special feature on local success
    stories.</p>

    <h3>Types of Session</h3>

    <p>A <em>presentation</em> is a general discussion of some topic,
    including (but not limited to) the software, the community, relationships
    with other software or communities, and political or philosophical
    issues. Presentations should be limited to 50 minutes (including
    questions and answers).</p>

    <p>A <em>workshop</em> is a "hands-on labs." session, in which the
    presenter takes the audience step-by-step through a task, or provides
    hands-on tuition for audience in a classroom format. Presenters may
    request extended workshop sessions up to half a day in duration for
    complex tasks (e.g. how to set up a build environment).</p>

    <p>A <em>BoF (Birds of a Feather meeting)</em> is an informal gathering
    of people in a particular group, or interested in a specific topic.
    Examples include the members of a native-language group, the marketing
    project, documentation writers, or Apple Mac porters.</p>

    <p>A <em>panel discussion</em> involves a group of people (usually 3 or
    4) led by a moderator. The participants make opening and closing
    statements on the topic, may discuss the topic among themselves, and may
    answer questions from the audience (usually submitted in
    advance).</p><a id="bursary" name="bursary"></a>

    <h3>Travel Bursaries</h3>

    <p>As this is the first time OOoCon has been held outside Europe, we are
    will be offering bursaries to speakers to help defray the costs of
    attending. A bursary will consist of free room-only accomodation in a
    conference hotel, plus a lump sum contribution of Euro 500 towards travel
    expenses.</p>

    <p>Each request will be considered on the basis of both merit and need,
    so if you need a busary to enable you to present your paper, please give
    as much information as possible to help us evaluate your request.</p>

    <p>To minimise bank charges, our preferred method of giving bursaries
    will be in person in Beijing (in any combination of Euro, US Dollars, or
    Yuan). However, in cases of financial hardship the organisers may at
    their discretion pay bursaries in advance. If you are awarded a bursary
    and would like it paid in advance, please apply with your reasons to
    <a href="mailto:pj@openoffice.org">the conference organisers</a>.</p>

    <p>We would like to encourage everybody to explore other sources of
    funding, even if they are awarded a bursary. If you are awarded a bursary
    and no longer need it, please notify the organizers ASAP so they can use
    the funds to allow another contributor to attend OOoCon.</p><a id=
    "template" name="template"></a>

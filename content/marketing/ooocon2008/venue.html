  <p><a href="http://www.chinadyt.com/">http://www.chinadyt.com/</a></p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 'Pearl Fishing Stage' is located in the
  east of Yuyantan Park, Haidian District, composed of a group of archaic
  royal gardens and a modern state guesthouses. It has a long standing of
  over 800 years and received its beautiful name from the old legend that Wan
  Yanjing, emperor of Jin Dynasty, once fished here. Till the Qing Dynasty,
  Emperor Gaozong ordered to dredge up Yuyuantan and build Xanadu here, which
  was therefore designated a royal garden of the monarch. Recently, the State
  Guesthouse was renovated and expanded significantly by the government of
  People's Republic of China based on the old beauty spot of Diaoyutai and
  used as the place to welcome state guests and venue for grand
  conferences.</p>

  <h3 class="western">Peking University</h3>

  <p><a href="http://en.pku.edu.cn/">http://en.pku.edu.cn/</a></p>

  <p>The Peking University, formerly the Jing Shi Da Xue Tang (the
  Metropolitan University) of the Qing Dynasty, opened in December 1898. The
  Metropolitan University was not only the most prestigious institution of
  higher learning but also the highest administrative organization of
  education in China.</p>

  <p>The Peking University is a comprehensive national key university. The
  campus, known as "Yan Yuan", the gardens of Yan, is situated at the
  northeast of the Haidian District at the western suburbs of Beijing. It
  stands near the Yuan Ming Gardens and the Summer Palace.</p>

  <p>The Peking University is one of the best reputated universities all over
  the world and the bridge for international communication in scientific,
  research and innovation. It will provide a platform for scholars, students,
  and developers from home and abroad to exchange ideas and thoughts during
  the sessions of the conference.</p>

  <h3 class="western">Peking University Hall</h3>

  multifunctional complex among nation-wide universities and colleges in
  China with advanced establishment and complete functionality. Facilities

  "en-US">multifunctional room, rest room, assembly room and visitor
  reception room are fully equipped to meet the requirements of meetings and

  <h3 class="western">Peking University Overseas Exchange Center (OEC)</h3>

  <p><a href=
  "http://oec.pku.edu.cn/oechome/en/index.asp">http://oec.pku.edu.cn/oechome/en/index.asp</a></p>

  <p>The OEC is playing an important role in the PKU’s overseas exchange
  programs and has achieved good reputation with its high-standard services
  and professional team since its foundation in 1993. It is affiliated with
  the Convention Center of Peking University, and has a number of meeting
  rooms with the capacity of 40-450 people.</p>

  <p>The OEC consists of three departments, taking charge of international
  conference organization, overseas exchange project arrangement, and venue
  rental.</p>

  <p>The OEC has successfully organized hundreds of international conferences
  with the number of participants from dozens to over a thousand, for
  example, the Harvard World Model United Nations 2006, which attracted 1500
  participants from 162 colleges of 38 countries and was recorded as the
  largest conference in PKU’s history.</p>

  <p>The OEC serves as a platform for overseas scholars and students to get
  to know China and the Peking University. We have developed a long and
  intimate relationship with a number of overseas colleges and academic
  institutions from America, Europe, Japan, Korea, etc. Every year OEC
  arranges a tour and field study programs for a variety of student and/or
  scholar groups. With the increasing interest in both Chinese language and
  culture throughout the world, OEC has made it a priority to diversify the
  amount of overseas exchange projects it is a part of.</p>

<h2>Beijing</h2>

<h3>Eating and drinking</h3>

<p>Beijing offers a unique density of restaurants and several bar quarters.
The venue itself is located in a quarter known for its good and versatile
restaurants, discotheques and music clubs. Another hot-spot of Beijing night
life is the Houhai bar area, which is 3.5 kilometers away and nicely located
at one of the famous lakes near Beijing's Forbidden City.</p>

<p>Very(!) good lunch/dinner starts at 2€ per person. Beer starts at 0.3€ for
0.5 liter. (Above mentioned bar streets are more expensive, but still not too
bad from an European point of view.)</p>

<p>We expect also a easier communication with the service personal in bars
and restaurants, as a lot of them will have basic English knowledge after the
Olympics.</p>

<h3>Getting around</h3>

<p>Travel to the venue from the conference hotels will be guaranteed by
shuttle buses. However, none of the hotels selected by the organizers is more
than 30 minutes (2.5 kilometers) by foot away from the venue. Despite the
gigantic size of Beijing, the whole OOo community will stay very close
together.</p>

<p>Taxis in Beijing cost 1€ for the first five kilometers. Every additional
kilometer is 0.2€. Beijing subway costs 0.2€ for each destination. The subway
network will be significantly enhanced for the Olympic Games. Prices for
Beijing buses start at 0.1€.</p>

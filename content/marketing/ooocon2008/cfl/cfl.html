    <h2>Call for Location</h2>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Community is now accepting proposals for hosting
    its next annual international conference, OOoCon 2008. Since the first
    conference in 2003, OOoCon has been held in Germany, Slovenia, France,
    and Spain - could your local OpenOffice.org community rise to the
    challenge in 2008?</p>

    <p>Hosting OOoCon is challenging, rewarding, exhilarating, exhausting ...
    and can provide a huge publicity boost for OpenOffice.org in the host
    country. There is no fixed date for OOoCon, although the past five
    conferences have been held in the autumn / fall.</p>

    <p>Proposals should be submitted to the conference mailing list before
    midnight UTC on February 10th 2008 and must follow the following
    guidelines:</p>

    <h2>Key Question</h2>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Why is your location and the date you propose the best for OOoCon
      2008?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mandatory Information</h2>

    <p>Your proposal MUST include</p>

      <li>Special visa or entry requirements, e.g. vaccinations</li>
    </ul>

      Cape Town, Tokyo)</li>

      <li>Accomodation costs (youth hostel, hotel)</li>

      the conference location</li>

      <li>be aligned with a large IT event (e.g. CeBIT, Systems, Comdex)</li>

      <li>provide low-cost broadband Internet access (e.g. wireless LAN in
      the rooms)</li>

    <h2>Key Question</h2>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question: Why is your location and
      the date you propose the best for OOoCon 2008?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Bratislava is a great place for hosting international conferences,
    some of the international conferences which happen in Bratislava are the
    biggest one in central Europe. Slovakia have very good activities with
    open source software mostly in educational sector, there are several
    schools using such solutions for teaching purposes. The open source
    community in Slovakia, which also include some business like
    international ones such as Novell, Sun, IBM and smaller national small
    and medium sized enterprise focused on open source software. We have also
    strong support from a company 602Office, which is using OpenOffice with
    their own build and are selling support on such solution. 602Office is
    really popular among Czechs and Slovaks, since early 90s the only
    software you used for writing documents was from them, basically they are
    still really famous. OooCon 2008 can have a very intensive impact on the
    educational processes in Slovakia, which is good for youth people who
    will become pro open source adults in the future. Also it will boost the
    general wisdom of open source software, OpenOffice application for usage
    in government and can put a lot of light on the Open Standards issues
    which the world is facing right now. Promotion of Open Document Format is
    also very important mostly in the Eastern parts of Europe, where the
    government is missing experts regarding Open Standards and services of
    the government.</p>

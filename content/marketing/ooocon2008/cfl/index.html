    <h2>The Event</h2>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Annual International Conference (OOoCon) is the
    premier event for anyone interested in or working with OpenOffice.org.
    OOoCon is where representatives of all the community projects meet to
    celebrate and learn from the achievements of the past twelve months, and
    discuss how to meet the challenges of the next twelve.</p>

    <h2>The Location</h2>

    <p>Every year, a completely new team adopts OOoCon, brings it to their
    country, and puts their own flavour on it. They have a great deal of
    freedom in how they run OOoCon, but they can always call on the
    experience of past organizers and the central Marketing Project. The
    result is a conference which has a lot of fresh energy every year,
    guarantees suprises, but which is also reliably interesting. Many
    attendees consider it to be one of the most informative and friendliest
    open-source events to be found anywhere in the world.</p>

    <h2>The Choices</h2>

    <p>OOoCon is the Community's conference, so it's only right that the
    choice of where it is held lies with the <a href=
    "http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/guidelines.html">Community
    members</a>. <em>If you were a registered Community member on 1st January
    2008, you are entitled to vote</em> for the location where you would
    prefer to attend Conference. If you know you won't be able to attend,
    <strong>please don't vote</strong> - we want OOoCon to be held where the
    maximum number of people can attend.</p>

    <p>Teams were asked to provide information in a <a href="cfl.html">Call
    for Location</a>. Their replies have been presented in the same format to
    make it easy to compare one with another. Some teams have provided more
    complete answers than others.</p>

    <p>There are six locations to choose from this year:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="amsterdam.html">Amsterdam</a>, The Netherlands</li>

      <li><a href="beijing.html">Beijing</a>, China</li>

      <li><a href="bratislava.html">Bratislava</a>, Slovakia</li>

      <li><a href="budapest.html">Budapest</a>, Hungary</li>

      <li><a href="dundalk.html">Dundalk</a>, Ireland</li>

      <li><a href="orvieto.html">Orvieto</a>, Italy</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Please read the details of each venue carefully, and decide where
    you would like to attend OOoCon in 2008. Once you have made your choice,
    please <a href="vote.html">cast your vote</a><p>.

    <h2>The Timetable</h2>

    <p>Voting closes at midnight UTC on February 29th., and the winner will
    be announced shortly afterwards once all the votes have been
    verified.</p>

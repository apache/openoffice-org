    <h2>Key Question</h2>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question: Why is your location and
      the date you propose the best for OOoCon 2008?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Redflag 2000, representing the Beijing OpenOffice.org community, is
    pleased to propose Beijing as the first OpenOffice.org Conference outside
    of Europe.</p>

    <p>Since Redflag 2000 and IBM officially joined OpenOffice.org in 2007,
    Beijing has become the second hot-spot for the development of
    OpenOffice.org and several derived products. The contributions to OOo
    from China are steadily growing. As the capital of China, Beijing will
    also be one of the main future markets for OpenOffice.org to
    significantly grow. Having this year's OOoCon in Beijing would provide a
    strong impulse to the OpenOffice.org community in East Asia and
    significantly strengthen OpenOffice.org's position in the East Asian
    office suite markets.</p>

    <p>Beijing is a cosmopolitan city with a rich history. People coming to
    Beijing right after the Olympic games will experience a city that has
    re-invented itself. The infrastructure will be better than ever before,
    concrete spots have turned into flower beds, the city night life is
    amazing and, last but not least, the main historic sites have been
    renovated. The food in Beijing is among the best in the world. Several
    new subway lines will give easy and inexpensive access to discover this
    unique city.</p>

    <p>Beijing is well positioned to host events of the size of OOoCon and
    above. Every year a huge number of conferences are held in Beijing, among
    them numerous FOSS and Open Standards events. Beijing Software Freedom
    Day 2007, for example, was considered to be one of the three best events
    worldwide.</p>

    <p>Under the patronage of the main applicant Redflag 2000, the organizers
    will bring East and West, Community and Business together.
    OpenOffice.org's local corporate members; e.g. Sun Microsystems, IBM and
    Redflag 2000 will join with the Beijing FOSS community to host OOo
    contributors from all over the world to celebrate our globalized, free
    and open product OpenOffice.org.</p>

    <p>To overcome Beijing's location long distance from Europe, the
    organizers will offer a travel sponsorship program for long term OOo
    contributors, accepted speakers and others with cases of hardship,
    enabling them to join the community in Beijing. These persons will also
    be offered a free hotel room.</p>

    <p>Give OpenOffice.org the chance to experience the ancient and modern
    wonders of China. Vote for Beijing and let's jointly celebrate a great
    OOoCon 2008!</p>

    <h2>Mandatory Information</h2>

    <h3>Location (country, city, conference center/university)</h3>

    <p>Beijing, People's Republic of China</p><a href=
    "http://www.bj-asiahotel.com.cn/index.php?Locale=en-us">The Beijing Asia
    Hotel</a> has a big conference hall for up to 550 attendees.
    Additionally, there are numerous mid-size and small meeting rooms, that
    can be used according to the requirements of the OOoCon agenda, see:
    <a href=
    "http://www.bj-asiahotel.com.cn/meetingA_en-us.php">http://www.bj-asiahotel.com.cn/meetingA_en-us.php</a>
    <a href=
    "http://www.bj-asiahotel.com.cn/meetingA_en-us.php">http://www.bj-asiahotel.com.cn/meetingB_en-us.php</a>.
    The most important reason to select Beijing Asia Hotel is its perfect
    location on the east side of the Beijing city center. The hotel is
    situated in an area know for a vast number of good restaurants. The most
    famous spots of Beijing night life, like Sanlitun Bar Street are near and
    easy to reach. The Beijing Asia Hotel is also located close to a subway
    station. Most tourist spots can be reached easily and inexpensive.

    <h3>Proposed Date(s)</h3>

    <h2>Supplementary Information</h2>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>The Call for Location states: user feedback from previous
      conferences suggest that the ideal location will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>have a strong local OpenOffice.org community</li>

        <li>attract strong sponsor support</li>

        <li>have a low-cost/free conference centre with conference venues
        close together</li>

        <li>have facilities where people can pass the time, socialise, and
        mingle with other conference delegates close to the conference

        to the conference location</li>

        <li>attract the largest number of community contributers</li>

        <li>facilitate the attendance of a large number of Sun's
        OpenOffice.org developers (who are in Hamburg, Germany)</li>

        <li>be accessible by cheap flight and train tickets</li>

        <li>be aligned with a large IT event (e.g. CeBIT, Systems,

        <li>provide low-cost broadband Internet access (e.g. wireless LAN in
        the rooms)</li>

        <li>allow for video and audio streaming (e.g. via the support of a
        company)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Have a strong local OpenOffice.org community</h3>

    <p>Redflag 2000, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Novell have together
    more than 150 engineers in Beijing working on OpenOffice.org and their
    derived products. Several members of the Beijing Linux User Group and the
    Beijing OpenSolaris User Group and other local FOSS communities have
    already offered to volunteer in the organization of the OOoCon 2008 in
    Beijing.</p>

    <h3>Other local companies and organizations promoting OpenOffice.org</h3>

    <p>Ubuntu, Red Hat, China OSS Promotion Union, Co-Create Software League,
    The Open Enterprise Foundation (Huihoo.org) and LUPA (Leadership Of Open
    Source University Promotion Alliance)</p>

    <h3>Have facilities where people can pass the time, socialise, and mingle
    with other conference delegates close to the conference building</h3>

    <p>Beijing offers a unique density of restaurants and several bar
    quarters. The venue itself is located in a quarter known for it's good
    and versatile restaurants. Sanlitun Bar Street, one of Beijing's most
    famous night life quarters is only 1.5 kilometers away. Another hot-spot
    of Beijing night life is the Houhai bar area, which is 3.5 kilometers
    away and nicely located at one of the famous lakes near Beijing's
    Forbidden City.</p>

    <p>Very(!) good lunch/dinner starts at 2€ per person. Beer starts at 0.3€
    for 0.5 liter. (Above mentioned bar streets are more expensive, but still
    not too bad from an European point of view.)</p>

    <p>We expect also a easier communication with the service personal in
    bars and restaurants, as a lot of them will have basic English knowledge
    after the Olympics.</p>

    <p>Temperatures should be moderate at the proposed dates. We expect 15 –
    20 degrees Celsius at day time and 9 – 14 degrees at night. October is
    normally one of the month with a relatively small smog problem, as
    there's often a fresh breeze from the West Mountains.</p>

    <h3>Have a range of low-cost accommodation with easy/cheap transport to
    the conference location</h3>

    <p>Hotels will be selected and contingents will be reserved by the
    organizers. Lowest room rates will be about 20 € per person and night.
    Travel to the venue will be guaranteed by shuttle buses. However, none of
    the hotels selected by the organizers is more than 30 minutes (2.5
    kilometers) by foot away from the venue. Despite the gigantic size of
    Beijing, the whole OOo community will stay very close together.</p>

    <p>Taxis in Beijing cost 1€ for the first five kilometers. Every
    additional kilometer is 0.2€. Beijing subway costs 0.2€ for each
    destination. The subway network will be significantly enhanced for the
    Olympic Games. Prices for Beijing buses start at 0.1€.</p>

    <h3>Attract the largest number of community contributers</h3>

    <p>Beijing is perfectly located to attract a large number of attendees
    from the East and South-East Asian communities, especially Japan, Vietnam
    and Korea.</p>

    <h3>Facilitate the attendance of a large number of Sun's OpenOffice.org
    developers (who are in Hamburg, Germany)</h3>

    <p>The organizers contacted Sun Microsystems' OOo engineering team in
    Hamburg. We are sure to get a considerable number of their staff to
    Beijing.</p>

    <h3>Provide low-cost broadband Internet access (e.g. wireless LAN in the
    rooms)</h3>

    <p>The conference venue will provide WLAN and a sufficient number of
    sockets to supply and recharge notebooks. The hotel rooms will have
    either free wireless or wired LAN.</p>

    <h3>Allow for video and audio streaming (e.g. via the support of a
    company)</h3>

    <p>Both video recording and streaming will be provided in professional
    quality.</p>

    <h2>Key Question</h2>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question: Why is your location and
      the date you propose the best for OOoCon 2008?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The city of Orvieto, with its 21,000 inhabitants, is one of the most
    charming cities of art in Italy. Located in Umbria, in the heart of
    Italy, it's 100 km far from Rome and 140 km from Florence and easy to
    reach by plane, train and car.</p>

    <p>It is a center for courses leading to university degrees (Informatics
    and Telecommunications Engineering), post-graduate courses (Architecture,
    Health Psychology, Archaeology), as well as specialization courses of
    prestigious Italian universities.</p>

    <p>The plateau with its tufa cliff walls defines the area of the
    historical center of Orvieto – a stupendous palimpsest of Etruscan,
    Medieval and Renaissance structures. The city is known for its efficient
    congress facilities and a qualified service network for hospitality.
    Restaurants, wine and champagne bars and pubs offer a variety of the fine
    wines and foods for which Orvieto is famous. These features together with
    the intact environment, pleasant climate and a system of alternative
    mobility make the city ideal for meetings, seminars and study days of all
    kinds.</p>

    <p>Not by chance Orvieto, world capital of good living (“Cittaslow”), has
    hosted important national and international appointments: Slow Food World
    Congress, Hydrogencities foundation (with J. Rifkin) and it is site of
    prestigious cultural events during the year which include Umbria Jazz
    Winter, Barzini Award for the special correspondent (in collaboration
    with the Corriere della Sera), the International Award for Human Rights,
    outstanding Art exhibits, Conventions and post-graduate studies of
    American universities.</p>

    <p>The political-administrative context is particularly favorable for the
    diffusion of open source culture. Umbria – the region in which Orvieto is
    located – was one of the first Italian regions to approve a law on
    “informatics pluralism” and to have instituted (L.R. n. 11 of 2006) a
    Center of Competence on Open Source that works to favor the introduction
    of open source software in the Public Administration and in the schools.
    This year 80 projects will be financed, 60 of which plan for the
    introduction of OpenOffice.org in the local institutions, 4 are projects
    from Orvieto.</p>

    <p>The Municipal Administration totally supports the candidature of
    Orvieto as an OOoCon2008 center, already translated into precise
    commitments for logistic and organizational collaboration.</p>

    <p>We would like to introduce some changes with the OOoCon2008. The most
    important is to hold an Italian session, in parallel with the normal
    international ones, in order to attract more people from our country and
    promote the OOo adoption.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Mandatory Information</h2>

    <h3>Location (country, city, conference center/university)</h3>

    <p>Two structures are at disposal for the organization: The Palazzo del
    Popolo Conference Centre and the Palazzo dei Sette. They are both located
    in the heart of the city, within walking distance from the main hotels.
    They are all equipped with wireless-lan (for each participant),
    amplification systems, audiovisual systems for projection and recording,
    teleconferencing systems.</p>

    <p>Every speech will be recorded in audio and video and a videostreaming
    service for the OOoCon will be setup.</p>

    <p>Several rooms will be available for public and private group
    meetings.</p>

    <p>Structures are close together and located in the city center where
    people can walk around and enjoy several pubs, restaurants and shops
    available.</p>

    regions are migrating to OOo (e.g. Regione Toscana, Regione Umbria) and
    many others smaller PA (municipalities).</p>

    <p>Interesting experience is the Chamber of Deputies which are migrating
    to OOo and Desktop Linux.</p>

    <h2>Key Question</h2>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question: Why is your location and
      the date you propose the best for OOoCon 2008?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Ireland is the second largest exporter of software in the world and as
    such is the ideal place to host OOoCon 2008. Not only will you be assured
    of Ireland's famous 'Cead Mile Failte' (translates literally as 'One
    hundred thousand welcomes') you will also have excellent conference
    facilities and huge local support from both the local open source
    community, patrons and the Irish Government.</p>

    <p>Louth is ideally placed to showcase the economic potential of peace
    and political stability on the island of Ireland as it is situated on the
    border with Northern Ireland. Both Northern Ireland (UK) and the Republic
    of Ireland are represented by this bid and if selected the conference
    will further help to replace past hostilities with a strong sense of
    community.</p>

    <p>This bid has support from many of the Open Source Community groups on
    the island of Ireland (Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) as
    well as the Irish Government, DKIT (University) and commercial industry
    in Ireland (see below).</p>

    <h3>Government support</h3>

    <p>The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Dermot Ahern T.D., has
    agreed to support the bid for OOoCon 2008 in Louth, Ireland and I have
    attached a letter of his willingness to proactively support the
    conference.</p>

    <p>The Minister said, <em>I am delighted to support this important event
    in the global open source calendar. Recent events in global markets
    underline the need for all types of businesses and organisations to
    ensure their competitiveness and the open standards and technical
    innovation promoted by events such as OOoCon are a key strategy in this
    area. I would be delighted and honoured to open this event should
    Ireland's bid be successful. As one of the largest software exporters in
    the world, it is appropriate that we share both our expertise and our
    famous Irish hospitality with the open source software community from
    around the world at this conference.</em></p>

    <p>The location of the conference (Louth is on the border with Northern
    Ireland) is also of huge importance and support for the conference has
    been organised on a cross-border basis.</p>

    <p>The Minister added, <em>As a border county, Louth is ideally placed to
    showcase the economic potential of peace and political stability on our
    island.</em></p>

    <h3>Social</h3>

    <p>At the end of a long working day, clocking off comes as a welcome
    relief and nobody on the planet knows how to work hard and play hard like
    the Irish!</p>

    <p>We have a number of once in a life time entertainment options
    available to OOoCon attendees:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Conference Celebrations in Slane Castle - Depending on availability
      we hope to provide Slane Castle as the backdrop for an evenings
      entertainment to open or close the conference. This wonderful 17th
      century castle is where U2 famously recorded 'The Unforgettable Fire'
      album. U2, Thin Lizzy, The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Bob Dylan and
      others have since played in it's historic Grounds.</li>

      <li>Medieval Drogheda - The town of Drogheda will provide a range of
      traditional music, pubs, clubs and restaurants to socialise, relax and
      unwind after each day of the conference</li>

      <li>Adventure Sports - For those of a more active nature a range of
      outdoor activities including sailing, windsurfing, kayaking, rock
      climbing and abseiling will be provided at discounted rates from
      <a href=
      "http://www.carlingfordadventure.com">http://www.carlingfordadventure.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For a small country, Ireland has an incredible variety of scenery. As
    an island on the edge of Europe we have a fascinating history that
    stretches back over 8,000 years. Louth (just 25 minutes from Dublin
    Airport) is Ireland's smallest county with some of the most amazing
    history and heritage including</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Medieval Drogheda</li>

      <li>Access to Carlingford Lough and the Mourne Mountains (an Area of
      Outstanding Beauty)</li>

      <li>The Medieval and Norman Heritage Town of Carlingford which over
      looks the Mourne Mountains</li>

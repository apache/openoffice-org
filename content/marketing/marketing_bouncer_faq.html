    <h1>FAQ - Recording downloads via MirrorBrain</h1>

    <h2>Why do we measure downloads?</h2>

    <p>One of the <a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/">Marketing
    Project's</a> key statistics is the number of downloads from the
    OpenOffice.org site. This gives us immediate feedback on the success of
    promotional activities, such as <a href=
    "http://marketing.openoffice.org/press_releases.html">press releases</a>,
    as well as trend information over time.</p>

    <h2>What is MirrorBrain?</h2>

    <p>When people request a download from the <a href=
    "http://downloads.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org download page</a>, they
    are directed to <a href="http://mirrorbrain.org/">MirrorBrain</a>. MirrorBrain redirects them to their nearest
    mirror site for the download they require, and records the request in a
    log file.</p>

    <h2>Does MirrorBrain provide the full story?</h2>

    <p><strong>No!</strong> - it only records downloads started a single
    point, the <a href="http://downloads.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org
    download page</a>. It omits:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>downloads which people make directly from mirrors</li>

      <li>downloads via other mechanisms, such as <a href=
      "http://distribution.openoffice.org/p2p/">peer-to-peer
      networks</a></li>

      <li>downloads from other third-party repositories - including GNU/Linux
      distributions (see next question)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note also that MirrorBrain logs when it successfully redirects someone
    to a download site - if the user chooses not to download, or cancels the
    download, then MirrorBrain will not be aware.</p>

    <h2>Why do MirrorBrain figures look low for GNU/Linux?</h2>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Community provides OpenOffice.org software in the
    two most common GNU/Linux package formats (rpm and deb). However, the
    majority of GNU/Linux users receive software direct from their
    distributor's respositories. This is a significant omission and explains
    the relatively low number of GNU/Linux downloads in our figures. How big
    is the gap? When we released OpenOffice.org 3.0, Ubuntu - possibly the
    largest desktop GNU/Linux variant - <a href=
    "http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/27/shuttleworth_ubuntu_commitment/">
    estimated</a> they had around eight million users.</p>

    <h2>Are MirrorBrain downloads the same as the number of users ?</h2>

    <p>No. Nothing like it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>MirrorBrain records only a percentage of total downloads (see
      above)</li>

      <li>Downloads are only one distribution method - people buy CD-ROMs, or
      get one from a magazine cover, or borrow one from friends...; people
      buy PCs with OpenOffice.org pre-installed... etc.</li>

      <li>One download or CD-ROM can be installed on thousands of computers -
      or none at all</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: the <a href="http://distribution.openoffice.org/">Distribution
    Project</a> exists to make OpenOffice.org available through as many
    channels as possible.</p>

    <h2>Do other people provide statistics?</h2>

    <p>Several of the <a href=
    "http://projects.openoffice.org/native-lang.html">Native-Language
    Projects</a> record download information for their languages.</p>

    <h2>Section 1 – Mandatory Information</h2>

    <h3>Proposed Date(s)</h3>

    <p>16th-18th of September 2009</p>

    <h3>Location (country, city)</h3>

    <p>Iceland, Reykjavik</p>

    <h3>Special visa or entry requirements (e.g. vaccinations)</h3>

    <p>None for Europeans and US citizens. Others depend.</p>

    <h3>Conference venue(s) (e.g. university campus, municipal
    buildings)</h3>

    <p>In Reykjavik there are two university campuses. The conference will
    most likely be held at one of those university campuses. If necessary
    other conference venues are available.</p>

    <h3>Conference facilities (e.g. WiFi, video streaming/recording)</h3>

    <p>All necessary equipment (e.g. video/streaming capabilities), free wifi
    on campus, cafe's, hotels, etc.</p>

    <h3>Accommodation (especially any low cost hostels etc)</h3>

    <p>Hostels, low rate hotels and other hotels. New hostel is opening in
    central Reykjavik in May</p>

    <h3>External transport links (nearest airport(s))</h3>

    <p>Keflavik International airport (40 km). Frequent transportation to the
    bus terminal in Reykjavik, the youth hostel and other locations via
    FlyBus available for a small fee.</p>

    <h3>Internal transport links (within city)</h3>

    <p>Buses (public transportation), taxis, sightseeing bus (hop on/hop
    off).</p>

    <h3>Team Lead (main contact person)</h3>

    <p>Thorir Tryggvason</p>

    <h3>Team Members</h3>

    <p>The Organization for Digital Freedom in Iceland (FSFI). The
    organization's goal is to spread knowledge and information about digital
    freedom in Iceland. FSFI holds, for example, an annual conference for the
    Icelandic public to raise awareness in digital freedoms. In 2008 Eben
    Moglen and John Perry Barlow were keynote speakers.</p>

    <h3>Local events that are taking place in parallel (or immediately
    before/after)</h3>

    <p>The team is ready to plan and arrange for activities, both low cost
    and more expensive ones. Activities could include a trip to Gullfoss (the
    real one), mountain trips, sightseeing, outdoor spas/swimming pools and
    more. Reykjavik is full of tourist attractions for conference goers who'd
    like to plan tours for themselvers, such as ghost tours, viking shows,
    museums, pubs, etc.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 – Proposal</h2>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:</p>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2009/2010 to your team?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Iceland is situated in the middle of the Atlantic and is therefore
    easily reachable from both Europe and the USA. With the recent fall of
    the Icelandic currency (ISK) the cost for visitors has fallen sharply and
    the country has become affordable (it used to be expensive for tourists).
    There are all sorts of accommodation available, from cheap hostels to
    high class hotels. A large group of Icelanders offer accomodation via
    <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">CouchSurfing</a>. The time of the
    year is perfect as most tourists have left (no accomodation problems) and
    Icelanders are starting work and school, open to new ideas and
    opportunities.</p>

    <p>The public and private sector, and the general population in Iceland
    have limited awareness of FOSS. Recently there has been an increased
    interest in FOSS. OOoCon would enhance this interest and generate more
    curiosity for FOSS, especially OpenOffice.org. The government of Iceland
    has, for instance, released <a href=
    "http://eng.forsaetisraduneyti.is/information-society/English/nr/2882">a
    policy on Free and Open Source Software</a>. The uptake of this policy
    has been slow but has generated some interest in FOSS. Many public and
    private institutions are looking at OpenOffice.org as a viable option but
    are afraid of testing it. With OOoCon, we could give them the push.</p>

    <p>Iceland is a country that needs to really have a look at all possible
    ways to save money after the financial crash of 2008. The conference
    would open the eyes of many companies and governmental institutions for
    the possibilities of other software than proprietary software. The
    aforementioned policy was created mostly with cost savings in mind, both
    short term and long term. A nation heavily dependent on one company
    (Microsoft), its office bundle, and old document formats, needs to look
    at other options. Awareness in OpenOffice.org is needed and OOoCon is the
    perfect way to achieve it.</p>

    <p>Iceland is simply an awesome location for the OOoCon (think of the
    photo opportunity: GullFoss bloggers at Gullfoss, drinking a beer named
    Gullfoss).</p>

    <p>Iceland is the ideal place for fun and action packed nightlife once
    the conference is over. There is only a short ride to a fantastic nature
    and scenic experience. If you are lucky, you might catch a glint of
    aurora borealis winding through the sky at night.</p>

    <p>OOoCon should enjoy a refreshing location in a country with a history
    and great heritage like Iceland. Vote for Iceland and experience a great
    OOoCon 2009 at the world's northernmost capital.</p>

    <h2>Section 1 – Mandatory Information</h2>

    <h3>Proposed Date(s)</h3>

    <p>November 12-13</p>

    <h3>Location (country, city)</h3>

    <p>Latvia, Riga</p>

    <p>Latvia lies between Estonia to the north, Russia and Belarus to the
    east, the Baltic Sea to the west and Lithuania to the south. It is the
    ʻcentralʼ Baltic country in both size, business activity, communications
    and geographical location.</p>

    <p>Riga is emerging as a top congress and conference city in Europe
    thanks to its strategic location, its rich and exiting culture, its
    unspoiled nature and its easy access by air from around Europe and around
    the globe.</p>

    <p>Latvia has a long history of technological innovation with highlights
    including the Minox spy camera and one of Europe's largest pre-war
    telephone networks. Today, Latvia continues this tradition with original
    scientific research and by hosting a number of companies that use open
    source software in embedded and professional solutions. Latvia has an
    astonishing transition, going from s Soviet republic to a member of the
    EU and the NATO alliance.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 – Proposal</h2>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:</p>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2009/2010 to your team?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The opportunity to organize OOoCon2009 in Riga is an opportunity to
    broaden ODF and OpenOffice.org popularity and recognition in Latvia,
    Eastern Europe and around the globe.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in Latvia is currently:</li>

      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li>In limited use by government</li>

          <li>Not widely adopted by education institutions and
          enterprises</li>

          <li>Facing resistance to change from a user base that is accustomed
          to pirated solutions, making for a ripe environment for raising
          OpenOffice.org and FOSS awareness people got used to existing
          usually pirated solutions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>LATA would drive promotions OO.o and FOSS through OooCon2009,
      boosting:</li>

      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li><em>Recognition</em> of OO.o and FOSS by those who are
          unfamiliar with it</li>

          <li><em>Adoption</em> of OO.o and FOSS by those who have heard
          about it</li>

          <li><em>Promotion</em> and distribution of OO.o and FOSS by those
          who have tried it</li>

          <li><em>Contribution</em> to the OO.o and FOSS community and
          projects by regional experts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This year offers a special opportunity to promote open source in
    Latvia and the region as we face our most difficult economic crisis since
    regaining our independence. Our public and private sector institutions
    face unprecedented budgetary challenges and would benefit greatly from
    adopting open source software, especially under the
    free-download/enterprise support model offered by Sun.</p>

    <p>As a venue, Riga offers and unparalleled combination: truly original
    and preserved architecture and a wealth of experiences within walking
    distance. Riga's <a href=
    "http://www.riga.lv/media/VecrigaInfo/en.html">Old town</a> and beautiful
    city centre is compact, romantic and full of <a href=
    "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g274967-Activities-Riga.html">fun
    opportunities</a>.</p>

    <p>Riga benefits:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A unique, economical environment for small to mid-sized
      conferences</li>

      <li>Central access to the Baltic market of 7.5 million people</li>

      <li>A Norhtern crossroads where East-West truly meets</li>

      <li>Attractive prices for goods and services</li>

      <li>Attractive cafés, bars gourmet restaurants</li>

      <li>The hottest night life in Northern Europe</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our Riga OOoCon 2009 team have already laid the groundwork for this
    event: the <a href="http://lata.org.lv/?page_id=67">LATA conference
    2008</a> was a major success with nearly 300 attendees and 16 speakers
    from around the world. We also organized Software Freedom Day 2008 in
    partnership with the Sun/MySQL team during their world wide developers
    conference in Riga, during which the team was able to benefit from Riga's
    wide selection of culinary options, entertainment and health
    services.</p>

    <p>Let OOoCon 2009 in Riga serve as a strong base for the future growth
    of OO.o and FOSS recognition and adoption in Latvia, Baltics and all of
    Eastern Europe!</p>

    <h3>Location (country, city)</h3>

    <p>ORVIETO (ITALY)</p>

    <p>The city of Orvieto, with its 21,000 inhabitants, is one of the most
    charming cities of art in Italy. Located in Umbria, it's 100 km far from
    Rome and 140 km from Florence and easy to reach by plane, train and car.
    It is a center for courses leading to university degrees (Informatics and
    Telecommunications Engineering), post-graduate courses (Architecture,
    Health Psychology, Archeology), as well as specialization courses of
    prestigious Italian universities.</p>

    <h3>Special visa or entry requirements (e.g. vaccinations)</h3>

    <p>EU citizens do NOT normally require a visa to enter Italy. Also many
    Western Countries do not require a visa to enter Italy these include:
    USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Africa and others. A
    full explanation of this given on the <a href=
    "http://www.esteri.it/visti/index_eng.asp">Ministry of Foreign Affairs

    <h2>Section 2 – Proposal</h2>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:</p>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2009/2010 to your team?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The city of Orvieto, with its 21,000 inhabitants, is one of the most
    charming cities of art in Italy. Located in Umbria, it's 100 km far from
    Rome and 140 km from Florence and easy to reach by plane, train and car.
    It is a center for courses leading to university degrees (Informatics and
    Telecommunications Engineering), post-graduate courses (Architecture,
    Health Psychology, Archeology), as well as specialization courses of
    prestigious Italian universities.</p>

    <p>The plateau with its tufa cliff walls defines the area of the
    historical center of Orvieto – a stupendous palimpsest of Etruscan,
    Medieval and Renaissance structures. The city is known for its efficient
    congress facilities and a qualified service network for hospitality.
    Restaurants, wine and champagne bars and pubs offer a variety of the fine
    wines and foods for which Orvieto is famous. These features together with
    the intact environment, pleasant climate and a system of alternative
    mobility make the city ideal for meetings, seminars and study days of all
    kinds.</p>

    <p>Not by chance Orvieto, world capital of good living (“Cittaslow”), has
    hosted important national and international appointments: Slow Food World
    Congress, Hydrogencities foundation (with J. Rifkin) and it is site of
    prestigious cultural events during the year which include Umbria Jazz
    Winter, Barzini Award for the special correspondent (in collaboration
    with the Corriere della Sera), the International Award for Human Rights,
    outstanding Art exhibits, Conventions and post-graduate studies of
    American universities.</p>

    <p>The political-administrative context is particularly favorable for
    open source culture. Umbria – the region in which Orvieto is located –
    was one of the first Italian regions to approve a law on “informatics
    pluralism” and to have instituted (L.R. n. 11 of 2006) a Center of
    Competence on Open Source that works to favor the introduction of open
    source software in the Public Administration and in the schools.</p>

    <p>The Municipal Administration totally supports the candidature of
    Orvieto as an OOoCon2009 center, already translated into precise
    commitments for logistic and organizational collaboration.</p>

    <p>We would like to introduce some improvements with the OooCon2009:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>an Italian session with simultaneous translation will be kept in
      parallel to the traditional ones in order to attract more developers
      and companies from the country to join OOo community and exploit main
      speakers presence</li>

      <li>a special session marteking to developers will be arranged</li>

      <li>community events will receive a special attention</li>
    </ul>

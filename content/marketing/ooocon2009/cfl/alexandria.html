    <p>Most visitors are not required to have a visa prior to coming to
    Egypt, as it can be obtained at the country's ports of entry. The
    citizens of the following countries are required to be in possession of a
    pre-arrival visa:</p>

    the Open Source technology and they are eager to contribute on organizing
    such an event, which will find hospitality from Egyptian participants,

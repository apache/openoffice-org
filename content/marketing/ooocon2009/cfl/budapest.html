    <h2>Section 1 – Mandatory Information</h2>

    <h3>Proposed Date(s)</h3>

    <p>Early September of 2009</p>

    <h3>Location (country, city)</h3>

    <p>Budapest, Hungary</p>

    <h3>Special visa or entry requirements (e.g. vaccinations)</h3>

    <p><strong>EU citizens</strong> are not required to obtain a visa.</p>

    <p><strong>Non-EU citizens</strong> require a visa to enter Hungary
    unless a special agreement exists between your home country and Hungary.
    These countries are:</p>

    <p>The United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Japan, Taiwan, Korea,
    New Zealand.</p>

    <p>If you are one of these nationalities, you may enter Hungary without a
    visa for stays of up to 90 days in any six-month period.</p>

    <p><strong>A visa is required for citizens of the following
    countries:</strong></p>

    <p>Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
    Cambodia, China, Columbia, Cuba, Ecuador, Georgia, India, Iran, Yemen,

    Montenegro, Peru, Republic of Macedonia, Republic of the Philippines,
    Russia, Seychelles, Serbia, South-Africa, Swaziland, Tajikistan,
    Thailand, Turkey, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam</p>

    <p><strong>Obtaining a visa</strong><br />
    If you require a visa to visit Hungary, please visit the following page:
    <a href=
    "http://www.traveldocs.com/hu/vr.htm">http://www.traveldocs.com/hu/vr.htm</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are still unsure whether you require a visa, please check the
    website of the <a href="http://www.kulugyminiszterium.hu/">Hungarian
    Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>N.B. No vaccinations are required to enter
    Hungary.</strong></p>

    <h3>Conference venue(s) (e.g. university campus, municipal
    buildings)</h3>

    <p>The site of the conference is the Eotvos Lorand University (ELTE),
    which has 3,500 students in its IT faculty at the “<a href=
    "http://www.infopark-budapest.hu/">Innovation and Technology Park</a>” of
    Budapest (which employs 7,500 people in the IT, telecoms and software
    industries).</p>

    <p>As the conference centre building offers a combination of smaller and
    larger rooms for both workshops and larger sessions, and has hosted
    several global events in recent years (of the size of OOoCon and above),
    it would facilitate more speeches, workshops, presentations and
    roundtable discussions than at previous OpenOffice.org conferences.</p>

    <h3>Conference facilities (e.g. WiFi, video streaming/recording)</h3>

    <p>The building is equipped with advanced facilities such as a
    <strong>high-tech presentation hall</strong> capable of holding 600
    people, along with several different size <strong>auditorium with
    PCs</strong> and a <strong>WIFI network</strong> all in the same
    building. Accommodation and Budapest's city center are also easily
    accessible from the event site with public transport.</p>

    <p>Our experiences proved that the infrastructure (<strong>high-quality
    sound system</strong>, conference hall, Wifi, special IT rooms with PCs)
    makes the venue an ideal setting for this kind of conference.</p>

    <p>An attractive web page will be built to ensure delivery of up-to-date
    information to guests as well as detailed materials for the press. We
    will <strong>broadcast the presentations of the keynote speakers in
    realtime</strong> on the dedicated website. To <strong>ease social
    networking</strong> we will publish a personal page with a photo and
    short description of each speaker and registered member that choose this
    option.</p>

    <p>We would like to allow numerous creatives, technologists, scientists
    and programmers the chance to share their interesting ideas at the
    conference. For that reason, one of the days of this conference will be
    set up as a BarCamp, at which a huge number of spokespeople can propose a
    presentation and attendees will themselves decide on which conference
    topics and activities will take place on that day. Every registered guest
    can vote online on the official web page of the conference.</p>

    <h3>Accommodation (especially any low cost hostels etc)</h3>

    <p>September is the favourite period of tourists for city breaks, so the
    organizers are ready to make block reservations for the participants. The
    organizers will also give support (tel., email) to help you to make the
    reservation in the recommended accommodation. All hotels recommended are
    standard European quality and price.</p>

    <h3>External transport links (nearest airport(s))</h3>

    <p>Hungary is located in the centre of Europe, therefore all the major
    worldwide airlines (such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Air France,
    Alitalia, SAS, Aeroflot, etc) fly to Ferihegy Airport. The Hungarian
    national airline – MALEV also offers daily connections to all the
    European capitals.</p>

    <p>An average return flight ticket from any European country to Budapest
    may cost between EUR 150 and EUR 450, although flying by low-cost
    airlines can make big savings.</p>

    in Budapest to all registered guests.</p>

    <h2>Section 2 – Proposal</h2>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:</p>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2009/2010 to your team?</p>
    </div>

    <p>We are proud to propose Budapest as a location for the 2009
    OpenOffice.org Conference.</p>

    <p>Hungary has a <strong>large and enthusiastic community of
    OpenOffice.org localizers and developers</strong> who have managed
    numerous OpenOffice.org related developments: extensions (OxygenOffice,
    EuroOffice), quality assurance of OpenOffice.org code, the Hungarian
    spell check library (HunSpell) and several value-added localized
    OpenOffice.org code-based products (StarOffice, EuroOffice). A consortium
    of local companies and universities won a EUR 2.1 million tender in 2008.
    The aim of this three-year project is to develop a software quality
    assurance service-package for open document format applications and
    thereby increase the level of inter-interoperability of OpenOffice.org.
    This will significantly strengthen its position on the worldwide
    corporate market.</p>

    <p>The OOoCon 2009 event in Budapest is already attracting <strong>a
    large number of potential supporters and sponsors</strong>, including the
    government and universities, as well as multinational and local vendors,
    as our preliminary negotiations with them have clearly demonstrated.</p>

    <p>All the recommended <strong>accommodation offers easy access to the
    location of the conference</strong> (InfoPark) and also to the city
    center. We will also provide a <strong>three-day ticket for all means of
    public transport in Budapest to all registered guests</strong>.</p>

    <p>To avoid any problems we will ensure a printed <strong>information
    package</strong> (city map, emergency card, conference map, schedule,
    important telephone numbers, recommended bars and restaurants, etc) and
    will send the same files by email to all our registered guests. We also
    guarantee a <strong>contact person, who will be on hand</strong> in the
    event of any problems, from co-ordination to visa issues.</p>

    <p>The organizers of OOoCon 2009 are offering a <strong>sponsorship
    program for long-term OpenOffice.org contributors</strong> - who will all
    be offered a hotel room free of charge.</p>

    <p>We offer the following entertaining facilities for our guests free of
    charge:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Banquet in the Salon of</strong> <a href=

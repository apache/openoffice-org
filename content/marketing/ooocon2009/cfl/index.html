    <h2>The Event</h2>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Annual International Conference (OOoCon) is the
    premier event for anyone interested in or working with OpenOffice.org.
    OOoCon is where representatives of all the community projects meet to
    celebrate and learn from the achievements of the past twelve months, and
    discuss how to meet the challenges of the next twelve.</p>

    <h2>The Location</h2>

    <p>Every year, a completely new team adopts OOoCon, brings it to their
    country, and puts their own flavour on it. The result is a conference
    which has a lot of fresh energy every year, guarantees suprises, but
    which is also reliably interesting. Many attendees consider it to be one
    of the most informative and friendliest open-source events to be found
    anywhere in the world.</p>

    <h2>2009 - we're changing the process</h2>

    <p>We have had some brilliant conferences over the years, but it is hard
    work indeed for a team to start from scratch, and run an event the size
    of OOoCon after as little as six months’ preparation. This year, we are
    changing the way we award OOoCon. We would like to award not just OOoCon
    2009, but also OOoCon 2010. The team selected for OOoCon 2010 will work
    alongside the OOoCon 2009 team, to help them with OOoCon 2009, and also
    learn how to make OOoCon 2010 even better. Then next year we will award
    OOoCon 2011, etc.</p>

    <p>So this means that this year, we'll be asking for the Community's
    preferences for the location of two conferences: OOoCon 2009 and OOoCon
    2010.</p>

    <h2>The Choices</h2>

    <p>OOoCon is the Community's conference, so it's only right that the
    <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/guidelines.html">Community
    members</a> have a say in where it is held. <em>If you were a registered
    Community member on 1st January 2009, and you would like to attend
    OOoCon, you are entitled to have a say</em> in where OOoCon is held.</p>

    <p>Teams were asked to provide information in a <a href="cfl.html">Call
    for Location</a>. Their replies have been presented in the same format to
    make it easy to compare one with another. Some teams have provided more
    complete answers than others.</p>

    <p>There are six locations to choose from this year:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="alexandria.html">Alexandria</a>, Egypt</li>

      <li><a href="budapest.html">Budapest</a>, Hungary</li>

      <li><a href="guwahati.html">Guwahati</a>, India</li>

      <li><a href="orvieto.html">Orvieto</a>, Italy</li>

      <li style="list-style: none"><a href="budapest.html"></a></li>

      <li><a href="quezon.html">Quezon City</a>, Philippines</li>

      <li><a href="reykjavik.html">Reykjavik</a>, Iceland</li>

      <li><a href="riga.html">Riga</a>, Latvia</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <p>Keep watching this page for details of the Community consultation
    process!</p> 
    <p>Please read the details of each venue carefully, and decide where you
    would like to attend OOoCon. Once you have made your choice(s), please
    <a href="vote.html"><font size="+2">register your choice(s)</a></font>.</p>

    <h2>The Timetable</h2>

    <p>Voting closed at midnight UTC on February 27th., and the locations of
    OOoCon 2009 and OOoCon 2010 will be announced shortly afterwards once all
    the preferences have been verified and verified.</p> -->

    <h2>The Results</h2>

    <p>The results of the Community Consultation process were announced on
    March 3rd. Orvieto, Italy emerged as a clear favourite with 48% of the
    votes. Budapest, Hungary was second with 29%. The remaining five bids all
    scored less than 10% each, so</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>OOoCon 2009 will be held in <a href=
      "orvieto.html">Orvieto</a></strong></li>

      <li>OOoCon 2010 will be held in <a href=
      "budapest.html">Budapest</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>See you at OOoCon!</p>

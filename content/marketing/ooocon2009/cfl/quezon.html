    <h2>Section 2 – Proposal</h2>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:</p>

    <div class="quotation">
      <p>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2009/2010 to your team?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Philippines is one of the ideal international venues in Asia.
    Being located in a strategic point in the Southeast Asia region, our
    country is very accessible and low cost airfares are available for people
    coming from different places around the globe. Aside from the Ninoy
    Aquino International Airport in Manila, there are also other airports in
    different parts of the country which service international flights.</p>

    <p>Apart from its accessibility, the Philippines, also offers
    high-quality services in terms of logistical and technical needs which
    are very critical in holding international events. It has one of the
    largest business districts in the Asian region in which all kinds of
    services can be found. It also has a large number of world class hotels,
    restaurants and other establishments which offer products and services at
    competitive rates.</p>

    <p>In addition to these, the Philippines is a home to magnificent sites
    inside and outside the metro and has a very authentic culture which make
    the country a tourist haven.</p>

    <p><u><strong>OOo Conference 2009 in the Philippines</strong></u></p>

    <p>The Philippines, with its expanding Information, Communication
    Technology (ICT) industry and its vast number of ICT professionals which
    are exposed to different tools and are providing services not only inside
    the country but in all other parts of the globe, will be the most
    appropriate venue to hold the OOo Conference in 2009 or in 2010.</p>

    <p>Since 2004, Philippines is one of the countries which host Software
    Freedom Day and CP-Union is the lead organiser of this annual event in
    the Philippines. This yearly event has always been greatly attended and
    the number of attendees every year always doubles from the previous
    year.</p>

    <p>With the growing demand and popularity of open source softwares, a
    bill on the use and accessibility of free and open source software (FOSS
    Bill) was drafted by a legislator in the House of Representatives and is
    now being reviewed in order to be passed a law in the country.</p>

    <p>Thus, the immense encouragement and support on the use of open source
    software from the different sectors in the Philippines and also from the
    government creates the best climate in propagating and promoting
    OpenOffice.org.</p>

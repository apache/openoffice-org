    <h2>The Call for Location is now closed</h2>

    <p><strong>Please note the Call for Location closed at midnight UTC on
    February 1st 2009.</strong></p>

    <p>Details of the proposals received will be posted shortly.</p>

    <h2>Call for Location</h2>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Community is now accepting proposals for hosting
    its next annual international conference, OOoCon 2009. Since the first
    conference in 2003, OOoCon has been held in Germany, Slovenia, France,
    Spain, and China - could your local OpenOffice.org community rise to the
    challenge in 2009?</p>

    <p>Hosting OOoCon is challenging, rewarding, exhilarating, exhausting ...
    and can provide a huge publicity boost for OpenOffice.org in your
    country. There is no fixed date for OOoCon, although past conferences
    have been held in the autumn.</p>

    <h2>Submitting a proposal</h2>

    <p>Proposals should be submitted before midnight UTC on February 1st 2009
    and must follow the following guidelines:</p>

    <h3>Section 1 – Mandatory Information</h3>

    <p>Proposed Date(s):<br />
    Location (country, city):<br />
    Special visa or entry requirements (e.g. vaccinations):<br />
    Conference venue(s) (e.g. university campus, municipal buildings):<br />
    Conference facilities (e.g. WiFi, video streaming/recording):<br />
    Accommodation (especially any low cost hostels etc):<br />
    External transport links (nearest airport(s)):<br />
    Internal transport links (within city):<br />
    Team Lead (main contact person):<br />
    Team Members (all members should be willing and able to commit at least 3
    hours per day to planning the conference during the last two weeks before
    OOoCon 2009):<br />
    Local events that are taking place in parallel (or immediately
    before/after):</p>

    <h3>Section 2 – Your proposal</h3>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:<br />
    <strong>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2009 to your
    team?</strong></p>

    <p><em>Note:</em> There have also been recommendations that we should
    move to a two year cycle, so this year we would also award OOoCon 2010.
    The team running 2010 would be expected to 'shadow' the 2009 team, to
    help them with the 2009 event, and prepare better for their own OOoCon
    the following year.</p>

    <p>Please indicate in your proposal if you would be happy to be
    considered for OOoCon 2010 if your bid for 2009 is unsuccessful.</p>

    <h2>Submitting a Proposal</h2>

    <p>Proposals should be sent to the <a href=
    "mailto:ooocon2009@openoffice.org">ooocon2009 (at)
    openoffice.org</a>.</p>

    <p>The deadline for submissions is <strong>midnight UTC on February 1st
    2009</strong>.</p>

    <p>Shortly after that date we will publish the applications and start the
    selection process, during which Community members will be invited to make
    their preferences known through a community consultation process.</p>

    <p>Information about previous OpenOffice.org Conferences can be found at
    <a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/conference/">the OOoCon
    website</a>. The proposals submitted for OOoCon2008 are available
    <a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/ooocon2008/cfl/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you and good luck with your proposals!</p>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Conference Team.</p>

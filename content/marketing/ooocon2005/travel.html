<b>Geting from airport to Koper-Capodistria</b><br>
<p>We have arranged for some kind of shuttle, which will take visitors from Trieste airport (Ronchi del Legionari) or
Ljubljana-Brnik airport to Koper. this will cost about 10 EUR (max) per person and will take you from the airport
directly to the center of Koper. It is cheaper than train and you don't have to worry about catching a bus or train
or getting lost. :-)</p>
<b>Car rentals</b><br>
<p>If anyone is interested, a car rental company has offered some very cheap prices for renting cars to conference
visitors. this would include also delivering the cars to the airport, if you wished so. If two or more of you decided to
share a car, you could get off much better than using the bus services. Besides, the slovenian coast is only about 40
kilometers long, but has some very nice scenery. This would also enable you to look for accomodation outside of the
city center and you could get much better prices for rooms.</p>
<p>The car-rental company promised us to not worry you much aboutinternational driving licenses, since they have
never had any problems with that. The website is still being worked on, but if you are interested in their current
prices (OOoCon attendees are entitled to 10 % discount), check out <a href="http://rentacarslo.net">http://rentacarslo.net</a>.</p>
<p>We have been asked, however, that you do not make reservations through the form on the website, because you
will be entitled to different prices and conditions. Anyone interested in renting a car, should send information to
<a href="mailto:rentacar@urska.org">rentacar@urska.org</a>. </p>

        <h4>Travel By Airplane</h4>
        <p> <a href="http://www.aeroporto.fvg.it/UK/html/index.html">Trieste Airport Ronchi dei Legionari</a> (TRS) is located 50km north of Koper - Capodistria in Italy. <br>

The closest one is "Ronchi dei Legionari" near the city of Gorizia, ~40km from Trieste. Venice is surely the biggest one, and maybe has
much more flights from other countries but is a bit away from Trieste: ~160km. Treviso is ~20km from Venice.</p>

        <h4><a name="bycar"></a>Travel By Car</h4>
        <p>EU citizens use their regular license. Everyone else (with some exceptions) should obtain an international
drivers license.<br>
<p>You must have your car lights on <b>all the time.</b> Pay attention when you cross Italy or Austria, you must have
a "high visibility warning clothing" - I don't know if it is obligatory in the other countries too. You can buy it on gas stations.<br>
If you have problems with your car, you can call <a href="http://www.amzs.si/?podrocje=294">AMZS (Automobile Association of Slovenia)</a>
on tel. 1987 (call from Slovenia) or +386 1 530 53 53 or you can use telephone cabines on highway, located every kilometer. On AMZS site you can find
more information on highways and toll prices. For orientation: a toll from Maribor (NE of Slovenia, entry toll station
Pesnica) to Koper (SW of Slovenia, exit toll station Videz) is 2.410 SIT (~10 EUR).<br>
<b>Speed limits:</b>
<ul>
<li>130 km/h (~85 mph) on highways
<li>100 km/h (~65 mph) on roads reserved for motor vehicles
<li>90 km/h (~60 mph) on other roads
</ul>
<b>Other important telephone numbers:</b>
<ul>
<li>Police: 113
<li>Ambulance: 112
</ul>
And, of course, you can always call OOoCon organizers to help you out :-) (find telephone contacts in sponsorship
document).

          <font color="#0000ff"><a href="mailto:callforpapers@openoffice.org">callforpapers@openoffice.org</a></font></strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong><font color="#0000ff"><a href="paper_template.sxw">template for paper submission</a></font></strong><br>
          <br>
          <strong>As the OpenOffice.org community consists of members from countries all over the world the talk must be in English.</strong></p>
<p>
          While the time slots have not yet been finalized we made
	good experience with 50 minutes sessions
(including Q&A).</p>
          <p>
          Your proposal must be sent before 10 July 2005 in order to
be considered for inclusion in the Conference.<br>
          </p>
<p>
A <strong>presentation</strong> is a general discussion of some topic, including (but not limited to) the software, the community, relationships with other software or communities, and political or philosophical issues.
<br>
A <strong>case study</strong> is a specific type of presentation that tells what you did to achieve some result; this is usually a success story, but could include a discussion of what mistakes you made and how you overcame them.
<br>
A <strong>workshop</strong> is a "how-to" session, in which the presenter gives step-by-step instructions for doing some task such as writing macros, setting up a database, or developing a complex spreadsheet. Workshops usually include some audience activities.
<br>
A <strong>BoF</strong> ("Birds of a Feather" meeting) is an informal gathering of people in a particular group, or interested in a specific topic. Examples include the members of a native-language group, the marketing project, documentation writers, or Macintosh coders. 
<br>
A <strong>panel discussion</strong> involves a group of people (usually 3 or 4) led by a moderator. The participants make opening and closing statements on the topic, may discuss the topic among themselves, and may answer questions from the audience (usually submited in advance). 
<br>
A <strong>lightning talk</strong> is a brief presentation on any topic relevant to the conference.
It could be an
interesting format to give many people the chance to make their point in a series of exactly 5 minute slots. 
          </p>
          <p>
The Template for Paper Submission includes a section for requesting a travel subsidy. At this point we are not in a position to offer funding for all speakers, and those speakers who do get a subsidy are unlikely to have their full expenses covered. Each request will be considered on the basis of both merit and need, so if you are requesting a subsidy, please give as much information as possible to help us evaluate your request. Please note that someone presenting only a lightning talk is unlikely to receive assistance. 
          </p>
          <p>
          We recommend to use the <font color="#0000ff"><a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/ooocon2004/ooocon2004template.sxi">OpenOffice.org Impress template</a></font> for your presentation.<br>
          <br>
          ... and stay tuned for further information ...</p>

easier now than it was in 1.x times. Much

development process is open in several aspects. There are dark places
though.<br>
In his presentation, Pavel will talk about his experiences with
developer milestones, his build system and about his findings about
processes of Hamburg RE. He will bring several interesting (and
potentially conflicting) questions. Could public tinderbox help Sun
engineers identify potential conflicts between Sun build environment
and community environment? Can community member change the community
build environment without changes in Sun build environment? How can the
member of community fix P1 build issues effectively? More milestones a
week: can we follow them at all? Master fixes and moving tags after the
milestone is ready: should it be announced?<br>
Sun only child workspaces and their effect on the development process
(bugs in Sun internal bug tracking system, description of child
workspace vs. every change in CVS).<br>

      <td>The aim of this session
is to give a general overview of the projects
and its organization, but also tips to enter into a project. <br>
This session will have 3 axes in a first time :<br>
      <ul>
        <li>the overall project
structure (Accepted, Incubator, NLC, CC) and its communication flow</li>
        <li>the organization
inside a project and how the NLC could be a bridge
between the development project and the NL project, keeping people in
touch and introducing people to those projects.</li>
        <li>the
documents&nbsp; (like specs template and features described in IZ)
and tools used for collaboration (Licenses, JCA, CVS, EIS)</li>
      </ul>
NL projects are not independent&nbsp; entities, they are the first
step to
belong to a community and learn how to behave in it. For those who
wants to go further, the need of picturing the OOo community is a
requirement. Aside the structure, there are general principles that are
available in any FOSS community like: aiming dialog and consensus,
sharing knowledge and power, personal responsibility, confidence. <br>
This means for example that competencies are promoted and recognized
not as personal contributions but for what they bring to the project.
In the same way some are projects leads, but only contributors in other
projects. <br>
In conclusion, contributing to a project is based on an ethic of
discussion and respect for others.<br>
      <br>
Target audience: All people from NLC (or not :-) willing to contribute
to a project in OOo community for the first time. <br>

And then there is 3.0 and beyond.&nbsp; How can OOo capture more
attention?
There is the well-known proposal for OpenOffice.org Lite, which would
require a re-architecting of the code.&nbsp; But it may be done if
mobile
phone companies and others get involved, for it is a very popular
notion, one that merits more investigation.<br>

project is responsible for spell checking, thesauri,

spell checking and thesaurus features stand today, how they differ from
those in StarOffice and how the community can enhance them. One
important thing is of course extending these features to new languages.
This is a fair amount of work, but it doesn't require programming
skills and I'll demonstrate the approaches that make these tasks
feasible.<br>
      <br>
New thesauri can be built using OpenThesaurus, a PHP-driven website
that allows the community to work on a new thesaurus or to maintain an
existing one. &nbsp;Writing dictionaries is a task that's not well
supported by tools, but
I'll show the basic ideas behind MySpell &ndash; OOo's integrated
spell
checker &ndash; and how to get started writing your own spelling
dictionary. For grammar checking, I will show what is still missing to
integrate a grammar checking into OOo.<br>
      <br>
Also, the concept of a programming interface for spell checking and
thesauri will be explained which allows everybody to plug in his own
spell checkers and thesauri.<br>

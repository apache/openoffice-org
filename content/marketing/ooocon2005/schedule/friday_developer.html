and UDK teams are currently focusing
on the
improvement of the OpenOffice.org API and the development tool support
for the OpenOffice.org SDK, both with the goal to make the development
of OpenOffice.org macros, scripts and components easier. <br>
In this session I will present the roadmap for all
&ldquo;programmability&rdquo;
related work we have planned for the next minor and major
OpenOffice.org releases. So I will show how we use the new UNO features
we introduced in OpenOffice.org 2.0 to make life easier for developers;
how development of components will become easier with new code
generators and the integration of our SDK into IDEs;<br>
IDE support and new features for Add-On developers; improvements for
OpenOffice.org Basic and the Scripting Framework; new features for
component development (e.g. licencing, versioning and signing);
improvements of component registration, deployment and integration;
some examples and demos (e.g. from the Google Summer Of Code).<br>

well-known component technology.&nbsp; Recently, it has been
made available stand-alone in the form of the UNO Runtime Environment
(URE).&nbsp; That has opened up the opportunity to utilize UNO in
all kinds
of application areas.&nbsp; The relative advantages and
disadvantages of
using the URE in areas outside its original domain of OpenOffice.org
are discussed
and demonstrated in this session.&nbsp; Also, an outlook is given
of how OpenOffice.org
and the URE can continue to co-exist and to influence each other in
their respective future evolution.<br>

This talk will introduce the AMD64 architecture from the developer's
point of view, describe the problems in length, will consult the
solutions of the problems (either existing or planned), and present the
current status of the port.&nbsp; It will also focus on good
developer

There are many different way on how to contribute to the project, we

        <li>code contributions, </li>
        <li>macros, examples and
other contributions</li>
        <li>legal aspects </li>

branches </li>
        <li>channels of

The new OpenOffice.org development process differs in several aspects
from usual OpenSource habits of other projects. The session will
explain reasons for this differences and also discuss chances and
difficulties of having an own development style. In detail we will have
a look onto different roles of contributors, especially at the impact
of the new development process to core-developer, QA folks and
add-on-developers.<br>

      <td>OOo scripting and addon
production is just an other way to bring value to OOo by attracting new
developpers.<br>
      <br>
OpenOffice.org brings a lot of possibilities regarding scripting.<br>
With the 2.0 release, a lot of new languages are available and the
addon installation is now available at end users level<br>
      <br>
It is now time to take benefits of this capabilities and organize
ourselves to make addon production and use more and more easy. Building
the scripting project through 3 main branches is a way to
attract new developers in OOo world's and bring value to end users.<br>
These 3 branches are :<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide basic
knowledge and help new commers start quickly</li>
        <li>Collect the addons and
check/verify/valid them</li>
        <li>Provide a user
friendly tool allowing end users to install these addons</li>
      </ul>
I'll begin by a description of the scripting incubator project, the
needs regarding contributors and the benefits that end-users can attend
from. Then the attendees will discuss the following points:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>How to build a
development team covering the languages supported by OOo
scripting (basic, java, python, javascript). Define the tools in each
of them to make life easier to newcomers (pre-built wizards,
introspection tools...)</li>
        <li>The translation
mechanism we should adopt and the relation with the native-lang
communities</li>
        <li>The validation of the
submitted addons and the repository</li>
        <li>The end-user tool to
browse the repository </li>
        <li>The other
possibilities of such a deployment tools (templates, galleries ...)</li>
        <li>...</li>
      </ul>
Target audience: Addon developers (basic, python, java ...),
translators &ndash; native-lang representative, End-users who want
to deploy
addons ...<br>

We invite you to an open discussion about the programmability features
of OpenOffice.org. The intention of this discussion is to get direct
feedback about the current situation and the existing features and to
get ideas what we can do to make it more attractive and easier to
develop for OpenOffice.org. We would like to address several topics in
this discusson:<br>
- what can we do to increase the developer community (related to
extension, e.g. add-ons, macro libraries, ...)
- how can we increase and improve our code snippet base on
api.openoffice.org (more snippets, ensuring quality, extend to complete
examples, ...)<br>
- who can help to prepare developer documentation for different
abstaction levels and skills. The current Developer's Guide is more for
experts and we need further documentaiton for beginners. We need
specific documentation for Basic users as well as for Java, C++, CLI or
Python. Different kind of documentation reaching from best practise,
over short 5-pagers describing a single aspect to complete guides for
larger API areas (e.g. writer API). <br>
We, that are Juergen Schmidt (project lead of the API project) and
Stephan Bergmann (project lead of the UDK project), are looking forward
to an open discussion with interested community members to share ideas,
start new collaborations with others and to drive this important
programmability aspect for OpenOffice.org forward.

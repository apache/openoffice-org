      <td>In Slovenian high
schools IT takes place in the first class as a
compulsory subject. The main emphasis is given to the effective usage
of office suite software, i.e. word processor, spreadsheet,
presentation tool and drawing tool. Students are trained to use each
tool separately and they are also evaluated about their achieved
skills. However, at the end of the year each student has to prepare and
submit a comprehensive project in which all the winning skills are
presented and marked by teachers.<br>
There was a project OKO, in which Slovenian government was trying to
introduce open source software to the schools. Unfortunately, the
project was stopped even before it full started. Therefore, we have
only a few schools where enthusiastic teachers are doing their best and
trying to introduce new alternative model for IT.<br>
At Gimnazija Murska Sobota we have been successfully teaching IT in
recent years only on open source software. We have been using Slovenian
distribution Pingo, which is GNU/Linux operating system. OpenOffice.org
suite has been used as a major application. Support to native language,
availability for multiple platforms and free of charge licence are the
main advantages of OpenOffice.org in comparison to the competitive
products. Moreover, the functional similarity to other tools and
friendly interface made OpenOffice.org to our choice. We prepared
on-line training materials and we evaluated every year opinion of our
students. It was proved that our decision was correct. OpenOffice.org
fulfils all requirements of contemporary curriculum.<br>
Targeted audience: teachers, training staff<br>

<h3><a name="e2"></a>Introducing
Open Source Software &ndash; including OpenOffice.org &ndash;

      <td>The use of Information
and Communication Technology (ICT) is becoming
more and more important in learning environments, and it is usually
very expensive. This causes the global digital divide between the
world&rsquo;s information-rich and information-deprived which
affects
educational opportunities. So educational systems around the world
should take into consideration Open Source Software (OSS) as well.<br>
In the year 2003, Slovenian Ministry of Education has started the 'Open
Source Project'. In fact an 'expert group' of enthusiastic teachers was
formed and besides other activities we have also started a research
about using OSS in education, because any such research in Slovenia
hasn't been done in the past. We took similar questionnaires, as had
been used in two previous studies - one was made by the Northwest
Regional Educational Laboratory in USA and the other was made in
Europe, with a title &lsquo;Free/Libre Open Source Software:
Evidence from
Germany, Sweden and UK&rsquo;. In my presentation I will sumarize
results of
our - Slovenian research that refer to the use of OSS on desktops
&ndash;
especially office suites (including OpenOffice.org). <br>
As I teach courses in Business Informatics at the Business School I
never miss the opportunity to tell my students about OSS. According to
my experience, the best way of introducing OSS - especially in business
schools - is to show students OpenOffice.org office suite. I decided to
make a mini-research about attitude of my students towards
OpenOffice.org and would also like to present the results, which I find
to be very interesting.<br>

      <td>This is a case study of
setting up a sustainable business as a means of
getting OpenOffice.org into the most stubborn school environments.
OpenOffice.org and the community are an education resource through
their own unique social attributes. Schools will install the software
for this reason alone and so there is no head to head contest with
Microsoft Office. There are also spin offs in teaching young people how
to participate in the community, generating resources to support the
community and development of education resources based on
OpenOffice.org. Launched in September 2004 after some initial pilots,
The <a href="http://www.theINGOTs.org">International
Grades in Office Technology</a>
currently has 50
registered Academies and 125 registered assessors in 10
countries.&nbsp; The
initiative is self-financing and has now taken on a prominent member of
the community providing him with full-time employment in addition to my
own involvement and part-time involvement of other company
members.&nbsp; In
the longer term it is envisaged that the business will grow, providing
employment for OpenOffice.org activists, an income stream for
development, and a vector for proliferation of OpenOffice.org in
education and training. The early development of the project has had
modest financial backing from UK Trade and Industry, The British
Chambers of Commerce and <a href="http://www.thelearningmachine.co.uk">The
Learning Machine</a> as well as
general
support from many members of the community. Income generated has
already been used to support OpenOffice.org, for example, to provide a
presence for OpenOffice.org at the NEA conference in Los Angeles
attended by 15,000 educators.<br>
Target audience: Anyone interested in strategies to get OpenOffice.org
into schools.
Anyone interested in how to set up a sustainable business based on
OpenOffice.org.<br>

for teachers and trainers how
the exams should be prepared based on the testcenter workshop regularly
held by agami Training.<br>
The following questions are mainly focused: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Why do not all
countries have an OpenOffice.org exam for the ECDL? </li>
        <li>What is about training
material? </li>
        <li>What are the pro's and
contra's adapting the ECDL/ICDL1 certificate for OpenOffice.org or
StarOffice?</li>
        <li>Can the ECDL
certificate be used as a multiplicator tool for Open Source software at
school?</li>

      <td>The adoption of new
technologies is a process related to
economical and
technical reasons as well as organizational and psycho-social factors. <br>
At the end of 2004, Ospedali Galliera of Genova (a large hospital, over
600 pc's and 1200 employees) decided to turn to Open Formats by
replacing Microsoft Office with OpenOffice.org. The migration is still
in progress and is expected to get to completion within July
2005.&nbsp; The
process needed proper migration planning,&nbsp; targeted
communication
(which was given remarkable importance so that everybody could share
the reasons of that change), employees' training and post-migration
support. <br>
In this scenario, organizational and individual variables, developed in
the organizational psychology field, were measured through
questionnaires, as it was expected that more positive attitudes towards
OpenOffice.org could influence its acceptance and adoption.<br>
      <br>
The dependent variables of the research were:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>attitudes, usefulness
and easiness of new software</li>
        <li>acceptance and sharing
of organizational change </li>
      </ul>
Main predictors of the attitudes, measured through the questionnaire,
were:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;Organizational
climate for innovation&rdquo; </li>
        <li>organizational and
group support, </li>
        <li>the individual sense
of being able to manage one&rsquo;s
own problems
(&ldquo;general self-efficacy&rdquo;) and problems with
computers
(&ldquo;computers
self-efficacy&rdquo;). </li>

On-line and paper questionnaires were submitted to the employees who
attended the training sessions. Data collection is still in progress. <br>

Re-computerization of the Country based

      <td>The Cambodian
Government&rsquo;s Master Plan for the
Deployment of FOSS,
whose center-piece is Khmer language OpenOffice 2.0, plans full
migration of Government offices within the next year. All government
teacher training centers will only teach OpenOffice, following the
training materials and the certification program developed by the Open
Forum of Cambodia NGO.<br>
Fully translated and operational versions of OOo 2.0 (including help)
are already being used for training of trainers in the training center
of NiDA (National Information Communications Technology Development
Authority), producing 30 new prepared teachers every week. For this
program, Open Forum has already developed 45 hours worth of OOo 2.0
training materials (including teacher instructions), student handouts,
exercises, evaluation materials and 20 hours of training-for-trainers
materials. All this is supported by a certification program that will
help standardization of computer education in the country<br>
The strength of the program is based on the fact that there are no
proprietary computer tools translated to Khmer language, turning users
into demanders of local-language software, and showing that language is
strongest added value to FOSS adoption.<br>
The strategy is to distribute first OpenOffice (and other localized
FOSS applications) on Windows, in order to enlist the support of
computer vendors and the training industry (not trying to make them
change to Linux immediately), and then change to KDE on Windows and
then on Linux, a small change for users that will already be spending
95% of their computer work time working on FOSS Khmer language
applications.<br>
Thanks to OpenOffice 2.0 Cambodia is on the way of becoming the first
country in the world in which s FOSS productivity suite will be more
used than proprietary software.<br>

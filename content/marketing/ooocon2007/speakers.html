    <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
    
    <p><span class="content">
       The <a href="cfp.html">Call for Papers</a> closed on 31 May 2007. See the Programme pages for details
       of the selected papers.
<!--       
       There are a few spaces kept free

       have arisen between the end of the Call for papers and the start of Conference.
    </span></p>
    <p><span class="content">
       If you have a proposal you would like considered for one of the 'topical items' places, please
       enter your proposal using the 
       <a href="http://survey.services.openoffice.org/forms/public/survey.php?name=CfP2007_late">on-line form</a>.

    <h3>Notification to Speakers</h3>

    <p><span class="content">
      The Selection Committe received more proposals than there is time for in the
      Conference Programme. The Committee carefully reviewed all the
      proposals, with the aim of achieving a mixed programme which will attract a
      wide audience. This unfortunately led to some excellent proposals being
      turned down. Emails were sent out on June 13th to all theose who had sent in proposals,
      telling them whether their proposal had been successful or not.
    </span></p>

    <h3>Presentation materials</h3>

    <p><span class="content">
       An OpenOffice.org Impress template recommended for use for the conference 
       presentations is available <a href="presentations/ooocon2007_template.otp">here</a>. 
       If you would like instructions how to load
       this template into your copy of Impress 
       please <a href="presentations/template-how-to.html">click here</a>. 
    </span></p>
       
    <p><span class="content">
       All speakers are required to file a copy of their presentations in .odp and .pdf format 
       with the Conference organisers by <strike>September 1st.</strike> September 14th 
       (<i>Note: deadline extended</i>). <em>Speakers who fail to do so are liable
       to lose their slots on the Conference programme.</em>
       Presentations will be made publicly available on the Conference website.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><span class="content">
       <i>Why do we ask speakers to file copies of their Conference presentations in advance?</i>
    </span></p>
    
    <p><span class="content">
       Our Conference is for all the OpenOffice.org community, including people 
       who cannot attend for financial or other reasons. The people who attend in 
       person are a privileged minority; the conference website is an important resource for
       everyone.
       Having presentation material available on the site is almost essential
       for people who are attending the conference by video link, as it's often
       very difficult to read what's being projected on the screen.
       After the conference, your presentation will remain archived here for reference,
       further enahncing the value of the contribution to the OpenOffice.org community.
    </span></p>
    
    <p><span class="content">
       Please note that your session may be streamed as a live broadcast and 
       may be recorded and made available for download from the Conference website.
    </span></p>

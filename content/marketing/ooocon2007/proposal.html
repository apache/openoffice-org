<ul>
<li>Airports (Barcelona, Reus, Girona) with easy access to international flights and with regular low cost flights.</li>
<li>Nice Mediterranean weather and excellent food</li>
<li>Strong localization community (based fully on voluntary work)</li>
<li>Interest from the local government in free software</li>
<li>More than 100 local companies working on free software services and products</li>
<li>Lots of cultural activities: museums, modernist buildings</li>
<li>Terrific night life</li>
</ul>
Barcelona is one of the most dynamic and stylish cities in the world.
It is always on the biting cutting edge of architecture, food,
fashion, style, music and night life. The people, with their
exuberance, their creative spirit, and their persistent
egalitarianism, are an example of coexistence and integration of
cultures. Barcelona today is a city prepared to receive thousands of
visitors everyday. It is very well connected, and there is
accommodation available to host the whole OpenOffice.org Community and
many more. For instance, in addiction, flying to Barcelona from most
European countries is very cheap when you book in advance with the
appropriate low-cost companies.
<br /><br />
The Catalan Native Lang Project is one of the historic projects inside
the OpenOffice.org Community. Although small and humble, it's been
here since the very beginning of the OpenOffice.org project, much
before the existence of the Native Lang Community. We worked together
with Sun in 2000 to translate OpenOffice.org 1.0 into the Catalan
language and since then we have continued our work on a volunteer
basis for seven years. It is true that we are small team, but we have
distributed more than 2 million copies of OpenOffice.org in Catalan
for a population of approximately 10 million speakers around the
world.
<br /><br />
Altogether, the Catalan, Spanish, Basque and Galician communities will
work hard to make Barcelona the best place to hold an OpenOffice.org
Conference. We hope to hear as many languages as possible here,
especially the voices of all those small teams of translators that are
the true treasure of the OpenOffice.org Community.

<td class="b">Special visa or entry requirements, e.g. vaccinations</td><td class="b">We recommend that you ensure you remain legal while resident in
Spain and do not try to enter the country without the required
paperwork. There is a large population of illegal immigrants and this
is a politically sensitive issue so there are efforts being made to
prevent entry and to find and deport people living illegally in the
country.
<br /><br />
Citizens of the European Union are not required to get a visa for
Spain since they already have the right to residency.
<br /><br />
Non-EU citizens visiting Spain need a visa (visado) in order to
enter and visit Spain, unless there exists a special agreement between
Spain and your home country; these countries are those of North &
South America in addition to:
<br /><br />
Andorra, Australia, Brunei, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Gibraltar, Grenada, Hungary, Iceland, Israel,
Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Monaco, New
Zealand, Norway, Poland, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia and
Switzerland.
<br /><br />
If you are one of these nationalities, you can enter Spain without
a visa and stay for up to 90 days in any 6-month period.
<br /><br />
Visas are managed by the Spanish Ministerio de Asuntos Extranjeros
(Ministry of Foreign Affairs) through its consulates and embassies
around the world.
<br /><br />
You apply for and obtain a visa through the Spanish consulate
nearest to your residence before you travel. Honorary consuls
generally cannot issue visas but may provide application forms.
<br /><br />
Since visas are never issued in Spain, you must apply for them
before you leave your country of residency. Do not attempt to enter
Spain without a visa if you need one. There is no emergency procedure,
you can't bribe the police, your embassy in Spain can't help and you
will probably be refused entry.
<br /><br />
Generally, you should apply for your visa about 8-12 weeks before
the date of your arrival in Spain. You must first have a valid
passport with at least three months until expiry in order to apply, so
be sure to allow adequate time to obtain or renew both the passport
and get the visa application processed. Don?t leave this to the last
minute or you put your travel plans at risk.

<tr class="b"><td colspan="2">China market has great influence on the promotion of OOo 
<br /><br />
China boasts the broadest potential user market in the world:
137 million computer users in China; 100 million users of broadband Internet access.
Choosing Beijing to host OOo annual conference 2007 shall be the best and the most direct means to enhance OOo’s popularity in China and allow OOo to play a more critical role throughout the world. 
<br /><br />
OOo annual conference to be held in China will substantially increase loyal OOo users
<br /><br />
10 million sets of OpenOffice.org software pre-installed in the computer along with linux.
Only less than 5% of end users will use OO.
Hence, OOo annual conference to be held in Beijing will showcase the power of the community and strengthen users’ understanding of open source software; according to our estimation, OOo annual conference in Beijing will turn over 25% of China users with pre-installed OO’s into loyal users. 
<br /><br />
Beijing Municipality supports open source software campaign
<br /><br />
Since 2001, Beijing Municipality has actively promoted the application of open source software and in 2001 and 2002 a great deal of OO and Linux products were adopted for governmental procurement of Beijing.  As the first local government adopting OO in China, Beijing has been always promoting OOo products and now there are over 200 local governments using OOo products in China.
<br /><br />
OOo annual conference in Beijing may facilitate the combination of China standard UOF with ODF 
<br /><br />
Since early 2002, Beijing Municipality, together with other relevant enterprises, has been practicing the promotion and formulation of open document format standard. Currently, the promotion of incorporation of document format standard UOF, formulated by China, and ODF, is a course the Beijing Municipality and relevant enterprises (such as SUN, Redflag CH2000 Co.,Ltd and IBM, etc) are propelling. The year of 2007 is a year that decides whether a critical step can be taken in incorporation of two standards. In this case, OOo annual conference in Beijing will allow Chinese senior leaders to really accept that open document format is an unavoidable trend of global information technology. 
<br /><br />
Preparatory committee of the conference will provide you with convenient service: 
<br /><br />
Each participant is only requested to pay 200 Euro including following benefits:
<ul>
<li>All accommodation expenses during 3-day conference</li>
<li>Two days free travel</li>
</ul>

Let's take RedOffice, the most popular OpenOffice.org product in Chinese market, for an example. RedOffice is the first product in China researched and development basing on OO, it was introduced in 2001 with the People's Government of Beijing Municipality as the first user, till now it has been applied in nearly two hundred local governments of different provinces and cities, such as Beijing and Guangdong, and more than a thousand enterprises and public institutions due to its excellent functions and ease of use, its users cover a lot industries such as government, education, water resources, electric power, tobacco, medicine, iron & steel and coal mining.

<tr class="b"><td colspan="2">India is poised to become the largest deployment ground for OpenOffice.org. The developer community in India is both diverse and united, and development is taking place in the areas of localization and extensions to suit the Indian needs.
<br /><br />
The Openoffice.org developer community in India is coordinated by the BharateeyaOO.o group and is supported by various other developmental groups like PunLinux, Utkarsh, FSF India, Ind Linux etc. The development is also supported by the globalization divisions of organizations like Red Hat India, IBM etc. Along with it the group also gets active support from the National Resource Center for FOSS (NRCFOSS) at CDAC Chennai.
<br /><br />
In the past couple of years we have seen massive distributions and deployments of OpenOffice.org in India and OpenOffice.org has been in the limelight constantly in the government and political circles as well as the development community.
<br /><br />
This makes India a perfect venue for OOoCon2007. Having OOoCon2007 in India would attract a large number of decision makers, policy makers and OEM vendors apart from developers. Having the conference in India will also give an opportunity to the OOo enthusiasts from the eastern hemisphere and CJK to participate and profit and will do a world of good to the 'global software' image to OpenOffice.org
<br /><br />
We plan to make OOoCon2007 the biggest event ever.
<br /><br />
Dehradun is a most suitable venue to host this conference. Dehradun is the capital of the newly formed State, Uttarakhand, the gateway to the <i>Stepping Stone and Foundation to High Quality Education &amp; future leader</i>. It is nature's wonderland, a fascinating destination for discerning tourists. Dehradun has also emerged as a centre for Adventure Tourism and an ideal place for adventure sports like river rafting, aero sports and skiing. Dehradun, one of the most alluring picturesque valleys in Asia, which nestles in the arms of Himalayas blessed with salubrious climate, extends a cordial invitation to inquisitive and dauntless tourists.
<br /><br />
It is in close proximity to capital of India and is just 230 Kms from New Delhi and well connected to Air, Train &amp; Road Transportation.
<br /><br />
There are more than 100 Central Govt. and autonomous Institutions, Research centers, housing more than 30 Headquarters of Central Govt establishments. Is known as an education hub having some of the best schools of India. It has Universities, Medical Colleges, Engineering Colleges, and is just 1.5 Hrs run away from IITRoorkee, a premier Engineering College in India.

					<td><p>Current versions of OpenOffice.org already contain support for forms and XML. In an upcoming
					version, this will be enhanced by adding support for W3C Xforms:</p>
						<p>XForms, a W3C recommendation since October 2003, is the W3C standard for XML forms
						functionality. XForms is based on the concept of using arbitrary XML instances as data model
						for a form. Form logic, e.g. determing validity or dependance of data fields, can be
						declaratively specified with respect to the data model. Controls may be flexibly (and
						dynamically) bound to elements or attributes in the data model. Finally, submission directives
						allow to submit all or parts of XML instance data to a server. The greatest strength of XForms
						is arguably the high-level interoperability it allows for forms (including their forms logic)
						across a variety of implementations.</p>
						<p>This talk will introduce the new OpenOffice.org functionality to support the design and
						use of XML-based form documents. We will also discuss use cases for XForms, covering classical
						form applications and embedding arbitrary XML into office documents. The presentation will
						also include a brief demonstration of XForms support in OpenOffice.org, and will also show
						interoperability between OpenOffice.org and another XForms implementation.</p>

					 we enhanced our template dissertation-hu.stw, the xslt scripts and the technology enabling
					  us to present the whole package now.</p>
						<p>We start with creating a thesis in OOo with our template and describe the problems,
						we still have with the functionality of OOo. Then we will explain the technological process
						of converting the thesis from OOo, i.e. the OOo XML format, into the final XDiML format.
						This conversion is performed by using a system of xslt- , batch- and perl-scripts.</p>
						<p>Since several months all members of our working group have been involved in conversion
						and we are able to report on a varied experience in this field. Finally we explain
						briefly, how we use the thesis in XDiML format.</p>

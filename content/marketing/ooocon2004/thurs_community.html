					so excited about OSS that he has teamed with director Paul Donahue to produce a feature-length
					documentary film, called "The Digital Tipping Point"  to explore the cultural effects of the global
					shift to this disruptive technology.</p>

					<p>Christian's talk will include clips from film interviews of open source newsmakers such as the
					Mayor of Munich, Germany and the Education Minister of Extremadura, Spain.</p>

					<p>The theme of the film, and Christian's talk, is that OSS is a "disruptive technology" which
					could change the computer software industry as dramatically as Honda's disruptive Supercub
					motorcycle up-ended the North American motorcycle market, as discussed by Harvard Business
					Professor Clayton Christensen in his seminal work, The Innovator's Dilemma.</p>

					<p>The OSS community is the most distinguishing "disruptive" feature of OSS.  The dynamic
					nature of the OSS community and the economically sustainable businesses deploying OSS will
					preserve the "open" quality of the Internet and drive the creativity produced in the "creative
					commons" of cyberspace.</p>

						Usability and acceptance are very

						<p>As part of the CNCC (Compagnie Générale des Commissaires aux comptes – French 
						Institure of Statutory Auditors – CNCC is well-know in the “audit world”) extranet 
						project led by Unilog and Nuxeo, Indesko has developed the following functionalities:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>"Audit folders": an application that manages Calc spreadsheets created by
							auditors during their missions (statutory audits) on location, then provides on-line
							diff / merge of Calc spreadsheets in a visual way (using XMLDiff and XSLT), enables
							collaboration for the audirtors' team (versionning, forums, indexing, etc.), and creates
							financial reports.</li>
							<li>Integration of OOo with Nuxeo CPS, an open-source Zope-based CMS developped by
							Nuxeo. This includes "Edit in Place", SSL (client certificate authentication) and
							PKI support for better security. UNO Pythons modules provide those features into OOo.</li>
							<li>A full XML transformation chain for publishing books (accounting norms, law
							comments, books...) using OOo as a DocBook XML editor. The full chain is :
								<ol>
									<li>Authoring with OOo and collaboration using CPS's features. Contributors
									author OOo documents and manage them in the collaboration portal. Documents
									can follow an dynamic approval workflow (cascading delegation and approbation),
									and are always securely and surely sent to the server from OOo, using SSL
									Client Certificate Authentication.</li>
									<li>Live transformation and validation of OOo document into Docbook XML.</li>
									<li>Docbook is transformed into HTML (for direct on-line publishing with
									CPS) and PDF (for printing)</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Creation of a custom OOo distribution for several thousand users at the auditors
							firms (this includes : custom UNO modules, custom macros, custom templates, easy
							and packaged installation process, etc.).</li>

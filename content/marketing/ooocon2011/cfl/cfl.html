    <h2>About the OpenOffice.org Conference</h2>

    <p>The OpenOffice.org Community is now accepting proposals for hosting its annual international conference in 2011. Since the first conference in 2003, OOoCon has been held in Germany, Slovenia, France, Spain, China and Italy, and will be held in Hungary in the fall of 2010 - could your local OpenOffice.org community rise to the challenge in 2011? </p>

    <p>Hosting OOoCon is challenging, rewarding, exhilarating, exhausting, and can provide a huge publicity boost for OpenOffice.org in your country. There is no fixed date for OOoCon, although we prefer an autumn date. </p>

    <h2>Submitting a proposal</h2>

    <p>Proposals should be submitted <u><b>before midnight UTC on Sunday February 21<sup>st</sup> 2010</b></u>
    and must follow the following guidelines:</p>

    <h3>Section 1 - Mandatory Information</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>Proposed date<br /><i>There is no fixed date for OOoCon, although past conferences
    have been held in the autumn and winter; autumn is our preferred season.</i></li>
    <li>Location with country and city</li>
    <li>Special visa or entry requirements<br /><i>like vaccinations</i></li>
    <li>Conference venues<br /><i>e.g., university campus or municipal buildings</i></li>
    <li>Conference facilities<br /><i>e.g., WiFi, video streaming and recording</i></li>
    <li>Accommodation<br /><i>especially any low cost hostels</i></li>
    <li>External transport links<br /><i>e.g., nearest airports or train stations</i></li>
    <li>Internal transport links within city</li>
    <li>Team lead<br /><i>serves as the main contact person</i></li>
    <li>Team members<br /><i>all members should be willing and able to commit at least three
    hours per day to planning the conference during the last two weeks before
    OOoCon 2011</i></li>
    <li>Team members will be responsible for legal and contractual arrangements with sponsors and supporters. If that should prove too difficult, clearly state so in the application, so that we can plan ahead.</li> 
    <li>Local events that are taking place in parallel, or immediately
    before/after</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 2 - Your proposal</h3>

    <p>In 400 words or less, answer this question:<br />
    <strong>Why should the Community award OOoCon 2011 to your
    team?</strong></p>

    <p><em>Note:</em> The team running 2011 would be expected to 'shadow' the 2010 team, to
    help them with the 2010 event, and prepare better for their own OOoCon
    the following year.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note:</em> It has been our observation that as the conferences grow in stature they demand more professional effort. This is especially the case when dealing with the complex logistics of working with not only hundreds of participants, including businesses and government officials, but also sponsors. We encourage any applicant group to consider professional assistance, as well as Community engagement.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 3 - Protecting the Environment & Hosting an Online Conference</h3>
    
    <p>In an effort to support a sustainable world, the OpenOffice.org project not only provides a sustainable product and file format ODF, but wants to be environmentally conscious and reduce our carbon footprint whenever possible. Therefore, we ask every team creating a proposal for the OOoCon Call for Locations to consider the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>What aspects of the OOo Conference can be organized in keeping with the desire to be environmentally friendly?</li>
<li>Are there options like shared shuttle services and public transportation?</li>
<li>Catering might also be arranged to have less disposable containers, e.g., fruit on wooden sticks, glass bottles for water/drinks (and offer straws but no cups)</li>
<li>Consider arranging for carbon-offset services or fees.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also look into the possibility of hosting a purely online conference, i.e. taking place using Internet conferencing systems. For example, by way of IRC, Skype, GizmoProject or SIP phone or video conferencing, webinars, or whatever technologies you know of that can help our community connect and exchange information in a real-time format.</p>

<p>As usual, the community will consider all proposals and vote to decide where the next OOoConference will be, whether or not it is a face to face meeting or an oline event.</p>

    <h2>Submitting a Proposal</h2>

    <p>Proposals should be sent to <a href=
    "mailto:ooocon@openoffice.org">ooocon@openoffice.org</a>. The deadline for submissions is <strong><u>midnight UTC on February 21<sup>st</sup>
    2010</u></strong>.</p>

    <p>Shortly after that date we will publish the applications and start the
    selection process, during which Community members will be invited to make
    their preferences known through a community consultation process.</p>

    <p>Information about previous OpenOffice.org Conferences can be found at
    <a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/conference/">the OOoCon
    website</a>. The proposals submitted for OOoCon 2009 and 2010 are available

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
<h3>The OpenOffice.org Community is celebrating its 10th anniversary!</h3>

<p>This year's meeting will be held in one of Europe's most beautiful cities, Budapest, Hungary, from August 31st - September 3rd, 2010.
We hope you will join us in our celebration and conference!</p>

<p>Whether you are a dedicated developer, a contributor of any measure, or just interested in the project and its technology,
such as the OpenDocument Format (ODF), we want to hear from you. Please note the conference language is English,
and all presentations must be delivered in that language.</p>

<p>We particularly welcome proposals from developers and other contributors with information to share with their fellows,
from how to get started with simple extensions, through to the deep, dirty, and downright fun aspects of hacking the OpenOffice.org codebase.
We urge creative, ambitious ideas. This is the place for those!</p>

<p>Papers are also welcomed on any topic of interest to the Community: to the thousands of people who have joined one of our Projects and design,
develop, maintain, translate, test, document, support, promote, or in any other way help us bring OpenOffice.org's products and services to the world.
We especially encourage local communities to submit papers for a special feature on local success stories.</p>

<p>To submit a paper and associated files, please consult the regulations and send the packet to
<a href="mailto:ooocon@openoffice.org">ooocon@openoffice.org</a>. More details can also be found on the official OOoCon website at
<a href="http://www.ooocon.org">http://www.ooocon.org</a></p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you at our 10th anniversary conference to celebrate our achievements and show the world what we offer this next decade<br /></p>

<p>Let's do it together.</p>

<p>The OOoCon 2010 Team</p>

<h3>Travel Bursaries</h3>

<p>With rare exception, we will only consider subsidizing accepted speakers, and an accepted speaker includes those participating in a panel,

which can be spontaneous events.</p>

<p>If you are awarded a bursary (funding for the travel and lodging) and no longer need it, please notify the organizers ASAP so they can use the funds
to allow another contributor to attend OOoCon.</p>

<h3>Key Dates</h3>

in their final presentations before the conference by <b>August 2nd, 2010</b> to the email alias above. More details will be sent out to all accepted
speakers as the deadline for accepted papers approaches.</p>

<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

<p>Papers will be reviewed provided the following conditions are met:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The submission file is in OpenDocument file format.</li>
  <li>If submitting to a peer-reviewed track of the conference, authors' names are removed from submission, with "Author" and year used in the bibliography
      and footnotes, instead of authors' name, paper title, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Session Types</h3>

<p>In your proposal (abstract), you must state which of the following <b>types of conference session</b> you would like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A <i>presentation</i> is a general discussion of some topic, including but not limited to the software, the community, relationships with other
      software or communities, and political or philosophical issues. Presentations should be limited to 50 minutes, including questions and answers.</li>
  <li>A <i>workshop</i> is a "hands-on labs" session, in which the presenter takes the audience step-by-step through a task, or provides hands-on tuition
      for audience in a classroom format. Presenters may request extended workshop sessions up to half a day in duration for complex tasks (e.g. how to set
      up a build environment).</li>
  <li>A <i>BoF (Birds of a Feather meeting)</i> is an informal gathering of people in a particular group, or interested in a specific topic. Examples
      include the members of a native-language group, the marketing project, documentation writers, or the porting project.</li>
  <li>A <i>panel discussion</i> involves a group of usually 3-4 people led by a moderator. The participants make opening and closing statements on the
      topic, may discuss the topic among themselves, and may answer questions from the audience, which are usually submitted in advance.</li>
  <li>A <i>lightning talk</i> is a 5-15 minutes, informal and very practical presentation where the speaker presents how to solve a specific issue.</li>

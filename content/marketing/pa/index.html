<h3>
  <a name="10" id="10"></a>Welcome
</h3>

<p>The example set by libraries throughout the world is that sharing  knowledge and experience is beneficial to everyone. Parent to child, teacher to student, neighbours.</p>

<p>The focus of this project is to produce a CD which contains open source programs, training, and freely available information. The CD is presented so that Libraries and other Public Administrations can easily give it out. This could be as a Lending CD from Libraries or  a “Pass it On” or donation CD by any organisation.</p>

<p>The value of the CD to people lies in its ability to introduce and teach those who are unfamiliar with the software.  It also assures them that this CD is legal to share and copy. The true value to people will lie with the information they create.</p>

<p>The value of the CD to libraries and public administrations is that they can be safe in the knowledge that they have no liability concerning the software , technical support or any consequences of its use or distribution.</p>

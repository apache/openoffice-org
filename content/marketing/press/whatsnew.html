	</H3>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">	XML is a

	way of describing structured information, like the highlighting in

	text documents, in an efficient and open way. The new OpenOffice.org

	file formats are much smaller than those of similar suites.</P>

	<H3 CLASS="western">Improved Microsoft filters</H3>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">	Most

	people currently use Microsoft Office so excellent compatibility is

	a must. OpenOffice.org provides filters so that even the most

	complex features are usually decoded.</P>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">	Chinese, simple and traditional,

	Japanese and Korean are just a few of the languages that have been

	added, check out the localisation project for more details.

source code available at OpenOffice.org does not consist of all of

the StarOffice code. Usually, the reason for this is that Sun pays to

which are or will be present in StarOffice but are not available on

OpenOffice.org include:</P>

	copyright reasons the email and calendar features (known as

	'Groupware') were removed from the code. However a project to put

	them back in has been started. More information is availiable at:

	<H3 CLASS="western">Removal of the browser 

	</H3>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">	There

	are plenty of excellent Open Source web browsers such as the Mozilla

	Project. It was felt that duplicating this effort was a waste and

	that we should concentrate on the Office features of the

	OpenOffice.org suite.</P>

	<H3 CLASS="western">Move to XML-file formats 

	</H3>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">	XML is a

	way of describing structured information, like the highlighting in

	text documents, in an efficient and open way. The new OpenOffice.org

	file formats are much smaller than those of similar suites.</P>

	<H3 CLASS="western">Improved Microsoft filters</H3>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">	Most

	people currently use Microsoft Office so excellent compatibility is

	a must. OpenOffice.org provides filters so that even the most

	complex features are usually decoded.</P>

	<H3 CLASS="western">Asian language Support</H3>

	<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">	Chinese, simple and traditional,

	Japanese and Korean are just a few of the languages that have been

	added, check out the localisation project for more details.

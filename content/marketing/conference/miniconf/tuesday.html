		<td><p>Historically, Muli has utilised an in-house word processing package for the production of external documentation (Purchase Orders; Subcontracts; Contractual Notices, Minutes, etc). </p>

<p>Muli/'Ngipi Open Business Accounts' have integrated Open Office for the production of all external documentation providing increased flexibility, enhanced Corporate identity, along with reduced in-house development/support effort. </p>

<p>Utilising known Open Office file format templates are directly substituted into a previously formatted document (using unzip, sed script, rezip), then opened for the User to personalise the complete the document. (Much of the document is protected disabling User changes to data which is required for accounting management/system integrity) </p>

<p>While the initial concept was to open and utilise '00' on individual's workstations, at this time '00' is served from the central server using 'NX'. A document management system has been developed to provide logical access & category management with the centralised storage of all produced documents.</p> </td>

		<td><em><p>Biography: Ron Skeoch has an Honors Degree in Building & Quantity Surveying from UNSW and Postgraduate Diploma in Business Administration from Macquarie University.  He was introduced to computers with punch cards (and a pin to press out the holes), and has gained his computer experience through many years of designing, implementing and supporting the Muli Project Risk, Accounts & Process Management System.</p>

<p>After National Services interrupted his part-time degree, he finally completed his degree after seven years and joined a major design and construction builder - Lend Lease/Civil & Civic working on major projects such as the MLC Centre; Tooheys Redevelopment in Auburn and OTC Paddington (gateway of half the Australian telecommunications at that time).  </p>

<p>During this period, he was honoured with the Granville Medal for his work in co-ordinating the engineering aspects of the removal of the Rail Bridge that fell on a train.</p>

<p>Muli Management Pty Ltd was established in 1981 as a construction company with an emphasis on Construction/Project Management services.</p>

<p>Muli identified the need for an integrated construction management system to enable accurate internal financial control and client reporting.</p>

<p>Muli reviewed available (economic) solutions and decided to contract to have the required system developed to our specifications.</p>

<p>Like most early computer projects, goals were not achieved and in due course Muli took over the project management and ownership.  The escalating development costs meant the product needed to be sold to other builders to recover costs. </p>

<p>Muli's first sale in 1982 was to James Clifford Constructions Pty Ltd, a working relationship that has continued right though many upgrades to today's continually evolving system serving professional construction businesses with turnovers from $2-200+M.</p>

<p>Due to our long exposure to economically developing and maintaining many User sites, Muli has developed a core principle of "Independent IP".  Muli will use only solutions for core product for which it has source code access, hence its use of Linux servers.  Direct development of own own "Basic/ 'C' compiler and Runtime" which we are tidying up to release under a Mozilla Open Licence as "Ngipi Open Business Account".</p>

<p>We believe long term access to a Client's business data should not be at the largess of companies such as Microsoft.</p>

<p>Muli has developed through SCO, Zenix, Interactive Unix, System Vunix with our first Linux User site installed in 1996.  By June 1999, all our Client servers were Linux based.</p>

<p>Muli is not just another accounting package that does job costing but a fully integrated Project Risk, Accounts & Process Management solution of over 600 individual applications.  (Muli's fully integrated Payroll module is over 100 applications).</p>

<p>For our Muli Release 'N' (portion of which will be released as Ngipi Open Business Accounts), we have totally redeveloped the solution with production of User documents such as Orders, Subcontracts, Progress Claims and associated Notices to utilise Open Office as the User production environment.  Muli has also developed associated 'Risk2do' and flexible 'Notes' modules in Version 'N'.</p>

<p>It is surprising how much tidy-up needs to be applied to a 22 year old project before one is prepared to present the code to the open community.</p>

		<td>In this presentation we described the procedure to integrate Bangla (national language of Bangladesh) OCR with OOO where the OCR program is treated as  client and OOO is supposed to provide its services to meet the client's request. This service oriented approach is platform independent. That means a linux client can send request to its server that can reside any of windows and Linux machine or vice versa. After getting the scaned Bangla document the Bangla OCR program will simply recognize the characters and send the Unicode value(s) of the characters to the OOO server with a request to open a window to display the recognized characters where an user can edit or modify the document. For accomplishing the above mentioned tasks UNO and OpenOffice SDKs have been used. Here Bangla OCR is used as a sample to demonstrate the approach. Therefore this work essentially gives a flavor to develop any usefull program or utility as a client in a distributed system by getting the service from OOO.</td>

		<td>OpenOffice.org is often seen as a mirror application of Microsoft 
Office. OpenOffice.org has modules similar to Word, Excel and 
PowerPoint, so many people ask about an equivalent MS Access feature.
OpenOffice.org originally changed their implementation from a specific
inbuilt database to a more flexible datasource model. This interface
however, was still immature compared to MS Access. Base is the new
database module included in OpenOffice.org 2.0 that offers many features
similar to MS Access. This presentation looks through all the steps in
setting up a database similar to MS Access. Progressing from the table
creation and population, creating forms for presentation, and then doing
queries and reporting on the data. A sample database will be created
during the talk to show how it works and what differences are noticable
with earlier versions and MS Access itself.</td>

		<td><p>OpenOffice.org is a popular office suite, running on many a platform. However, builds that come out officially from www.openoffice.org tend to only be for the x86 line of processors, on operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or even Solaris. However, users of Linux on PowerPC or more commonly Mac OS X on PowerPC are left out; it has become a community task to get OpenOffice.org running on the PowerPC platform.</p>

<p>Last June, at the Apple World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC 2004), we launched a milestone release, at that time with all other platforms � OpenOffice.org 1.1.2/X11 for Mac OS X; there was also a beta NeoOffice/J release. Since then, we've had varying issues and politics to sift through, but looking ahead, some issues we need to address are:<p>
<ul>
<li>OpenOffice.org OS X is still X11 based. It isn't a Cocoa application, as we require programmers with great knowledge of the X11 and Cocoa framework, as well as C++ and the OpenOffice.org build environment.
<li>NeoOffice/J is a GPL-fork of OpenOffice.org. It however, changes between 1-3% of the OpenOffice.org code base, to make it look more like a Cocoa application. What is entailed by NeoOffice/J, who owns it, will it ever become mainstream?
<li>Linux PowerPC users have two options: ooo-build, or the stock OpenOffice.org build method. Which do you choose? What about getting a JRE/SDK on the platform � what options are available?
<li>Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu build systems tend to roll out ooo-build't ones automatically
EPM on Mac OS X � for native packaging.
<li>What is our status? Why did it take so long (m72) to get OOo on OS X building?
<li>How you can help!

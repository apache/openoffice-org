<h1>Size of OpenOffice.org</h1>
<ul>
<li>10 Million lines+ of code</li>
<li>12 Gb to compile a complete OOo</li>
<li>Debugging only parts of OOo</li>
<li>No one can take in the whole of OOo</li>
<li>Scratching your itch</li>
<li>Number of programming languages</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>OpenOffice.org requires a reasonable computer to work on.  REalistically in
order to build OOo you need at least 1.7 ghz CPU, 512Mb ram and 14 Gb of
harddisk spare. I have built OOo on a Pentium 350 but it took three days to
compile. It does take a hardware commitment from you to make a build
possible.</p>
<p>It is almost a requirement to use ccache to build OOo. The first build is
not significantly faster (12 hours) but builds after that are much faster
(&lt;6 hours)</p>
<p>A complete build will take about 10 Gb, if you include debugging it will
grow even more.  This really is a huge peice of software.  In three years a
build has grown from 7Gb to just over 10Gb, where to next.</p>
<p>You can forget building a complete debug build of OOo and debugging it.
Thereis simply too much code and gdb will not really cope.  You are better off
working out roughly where the problem is and only compiling that module with
debug mode. You can compile with small symbols to get some debugging out to
narrow the search. Expect to need a Gb of memory in order to debug OOo</p>
<p>Frankly with millions of lines of code it is impossible to take in OOo.
In order to be effective you need to specialise.  Some have simple requirements
to "simply" port onto a platform. Others are working on an area like drawing
diagrams in order to solve some issue that they have.  The key to successful
development is specialisation.  Get an overview of the projects and pick one to
focus on.  We desperately need more focus on impress for example, it would make
a huge difference to focus there than to work on many projects and bugs with
little expertese.</p>
<p>Scratching your itch is simply work out why you want to work on OOo.  If you
do not have specific goals you will soon be lost in a maze of code with no
clear direction.  Again I repeat pick a project you are interested in and
work specifically with that project.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of OpenOffice.org is the number of languages that you
can work with.  The weakness of OpenOffice.org is the number of languages that
you can use.  There is an expanding base of Java being used in OOo, this is
causing a conflict with the debian community because there is no acceptable
free version of Java available that will run the OOo code.  Stick with the
language of the project itself, however if you have a choice I recommend using
C++ for development.</p>
<p>In order to be an effective developer you really must have an itch that you
are scratching.  My initial entry was simply work on OOo, this in hindsight eas
silly.  Pick something that interests you and work specifically in that
project. If graphics is your thing,  writer, grammar checker (please...),
why are you getting involved?</p>

<li>External code, libraries OOo uses</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>OpenOffice.org is a significant challenge to build.  It requires a fairly good computer</p>
<p>It is tricky getting the right combination of compilers and preprocessors
such as bison to make the build work.  If you work on older releases of
software, eg RedHat 7.2 you can forget getting a compile to work, you really
need the latest tools or be prepared to spend a lot of time with little support
getting it to work.</p>
<p>There are constant irritations that add to this.  The people supporting
bison seem to want to regularly break the current release.  It is irritating
when you have syntax rules that are suddenly enforced like xslt rules.
Consider not having the latest and greatest debian unstable release purely
to make your life with OOo pleasant.</p>
<p>If you make a change to OpenOffice.org you then need to have it accepted
by the community.  The "community" has, unfortunately, two camps  Ximian
supported and Sun Supported.  The difference between the two is the timeliness
of accepting patches. Both require you to provide a signed JCA before providing
patches.</p>
<p>The Sun environment is very structured, this leads to longer acceptance time
on patches.  Ximian is more packaging based, this allows for a faster
acceptance of patches with a higher risk of accepting bad patches.  They both
work together and ultimately  the Ximian patches do get integrated into the
Official OOo release.  The reason for the two is that Ximian is Linux based,
this means that patches that do not yet work on Windows are accepted and the
community will work on making these work across platforms.

<h1>OpenOffice.org API</h1>
<ul>
<li>Universal Development Kit (UDK)</li>
<li>Universal Network Objects (UNO)</li>
<li>Use OOo without requiring Voodoo</li>
<li><a href="http://api.openoffice.org">http://api.openoffice.org</a></li>
<li>Change menus</li>
<li>Add advanced features</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>OOo is as I mentioned is huge. In order to understand at a high level
where you need to change then take the time to understand that particular
project and then finally make the change can be a significant challenge.
There is always the expectation that you can "understand" the program you are
working on.  I have been working on OOo for three years and I do not pretend to
understand what all projects are for, I have my simple speciality and everyone
works with me.</p>
<p>Universal Network Objects (UNO) are the coolest tool since CORBA.  It is a
shame it is not known outside of OOo, doing networked objects correctly.  The
ability to quickly connect to other servers</p>
<ul>
<li>UNO does not degrade performance of objects when they are running on the
same computer.</li>
<li>UNO is easy to construct.</li>
<li>Write in any language and use any language.</li>
<li>Understands networks</li>
<li>Understands numerical formats</li>
</ul>
<p>Isaac Newton said "Stand on the shoulders of giants".  UDK gives you that
ability, without diving deep into the code of OOo you could for example overlay
the menus with perfect replicas of MS Word, if that is your itch.</p>
<p>Some of us want advanced features, intergrate databases into OOo documents.
We want to add features like intelligent tags when they open documents.
We want to construct driven documents or constructed spreadsheets.
We want to cheat the managers by automating those stupid presentations that
we want.</p>
<p>Most people wish advanced features but do not have time to work out the nuts
and bolts to integrate directly. Optimisation rules are first make it work and
then make it useful. If your extension is important leave it for experts to
integrate better later.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Work outside of code</h1>
<ul>
<li>Bug Triage</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Graphics</li>
<li>Website maintenance.</li>
<li>Document review</li>
<li>Project summaries</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>This is a world of many specialities.  OOo needs a lot of help in order to
function cleanly.  Simple tasks, keeping an eye on common errors and having a
ready answer to that new person. Improving documentation so that the
information is easily located.</p>
<p>Bug triage needs a reasonable knowledge of OOo.  It can require a good
memory to remember similar errors to recognise repeat problems.  If you
can repeat the problem in the release they have </p>
<p>OpenOffice.org comes with a few installed templates. Business specialists
need to write the templates to make it easier for their particular business
type to move to OOo smoothly.  This is an area where OOo can excel, we have
many dedidcated OOo specialists that we can do the best possible templates.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Working with languages</h1>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Scripting &amp; Perl</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>You have a huge choice of languages to build your feature with.  I have
listed a few that can work with.  I strongly recommend that you use C++ because
of licensing and support issues with Open Source versions of Java.</p>
<p>Java support causes problems because there is no "really good" version of
FOSS Java.  There is active project to make OOo work on FOSS java any new code
should be compliant to this rule hwoever this is NOT a rule that Sun will
enforce of course.</p>
<p>There are other features written in a number of languages.  THe important
thing is to stick with the language of the project.  If you are writing a new
feature then the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Of course the problem with writing C++ is designing the classes.  The
concepts are easy but designing a really good Object Oriented solution is
difficult. This is the challenge of OOo,  there are experts that can help you
to design your feature however you must establish yourself in the community
first.</p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Finding code</h1>
<ul>
<li>ASK</li>
<li>Grep for messages</li>
<li>Projects and modules</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>The obvious choice is to ask people what you want to know.
Do not expect to be able to lift the Word doc import easily for another project.
That is not to say you cannot workon making the API for document formats open
to all word processing software (HINT!).  filters is where the doc formats
logic is stored.
</p>
<p>Often you can grep for phrases from menus, or messages coming out of OOo.
This gives you a hint for the general location of the software.</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="http://projects.openoffice.org">projects webpages</a>
This provides an excellent overview of the what the different things are
for.  From the projects page you can go to a specific project page and then
you can look at specific modules.</p>
<p>Working backwards, you have found your code and you want to determine the
project that your patch effects,  simply `cat CVS/Repository`.</p>

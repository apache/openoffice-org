<h2>
OOoRegiCon 100 Club
</h2>

<p>Last Updated: 9 February 2005</p>

<p>The 100 Club was created to recognise supporters of OOoRegiCon.</p>

<p>OOoRegiCon is the inaugural OpenOffice.org Regional Conference North
America. It will be held 9 February 2005, Del Mar Fairgrounds
in San Diego, as part of the <a href="http://www.desktoplinuxsummit.org/">Desktop Linux Summit</a>. OpenOffice.org has also been invited to
participate in the DLS exhibition with up to two booths.</p>

<p>OpenOffice.org CDROMs are required to give out to attendees (an expected
audience of 1000) and funds are needed to subsidise our volunteers to
travel and be accommodated for the event.</p>

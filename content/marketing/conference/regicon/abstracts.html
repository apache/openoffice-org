		<td>Open source development, collaborative standards creation, the Java community, web services - each of these have been motivated by the desire for software freedom, and all have been consequences of the world becoming 'massively connected'. But each phenomenon has stood alone as its respective community has striven to achieve its goal of freedom through community. This session considers the origins of the 'massively connected' phenomenon, compares the approaches to promoting software freedom described above and proposes a new model exemplified by OpenOffice.org.

		<td>INGOTS provide progressive certificates that recognise skills in office
technology including the development of resources for the OpenOffice.org
community. A Gold Certificate holder will be self-sufficient in the use
of office software, confident to diagnose computer problems in an office
setting and will know how to gain free resources from the community as
well as contribute back to it. This session will describe the strategy
for making INGOTs a worldwide standard in schools thus introducing
millions of people to the OpenOffice.org community and educating them
about open standards and the power of giving a brick to get a house.
INGOTs have the potential to generate income that can be used to fund
development too.</td>

		<td><em>Biography: Ian Lynch is the education lead for the openoffice.org community. He
started work as a science teacher and was head of a large faculty at the
age of 29. He went on to set up the Government's flagship City
Technology College in 1988 and was subsequently appointed as curriculum
director for maths and science for the CTC programme nationally. He
subsequently set up his own consultancy leading school inspections,
helping schools apply for grants and devising development plans for
them. In 1998 with the help of his wife, he set up IRL Computer Systems
Ltd winning the Midlands Region Small Business of the Year Award in
2000. Developing the INGOTs is now his main priority having gained some
support from the British Chambers of Commerce for worldwide development.<em></td>

      Just as outreach is reaching out to the outside world, inreach
      means reaching out to those already part of the community.
      Community building depends as much on inreach as it does on
      outreach.  There are four steps to inreach:</p>
		<ul>
      <li>INFORM members of what's going on around the community.
      <li>REACH out to people.  Don't just wait for them to come to you.
      <li>ENTHUSE people about your project (inspire)
      <li>NURTURE a sense of community.

This session will discuss how the OASIS TC made dramatic enhancements to the file format specification to meet the next generation information system requirements of the European Union. Enhancements such as XForms, SVG, and SMiL were needed to meet the "custom-defined schema" requirement. Submission of the specification to ISO (the International Standards Organization) was another challenge met by the TC. This discussion will also cover the dynamics of Microsoft's arguments to the EU that MSXML file formats and licenses are "open enough", and how the recent capitulation of Microsoft to meet the EU's insistent requirements for "Open XML and Open Standards" came about. </td>

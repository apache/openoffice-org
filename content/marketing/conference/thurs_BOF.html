		An approach is presented which is currently implemented in
		the NUSS (Notebook University Stuttgart) project.
		Based on users carrying mobile devices and on
		wireless networks, it aims at a more interactive,
		collaborative way of presentations using OpenOffice.org.
		Especially when regarding the area of teaching, such
		increased interactivity is really indispensable
		as demonstrated by the following scenarios.
		<br>
		By distributing the presentation digitally to all
		participants, the page currently discussed is shown
		on everyone's notebook. Hence, each participant can
		add individual notes for later usage without any
		media discontinuity. For a more vivid presentation,
		the speaker can apply changes to slides
		during the talk (e.g. highlight or add something).
		After proper permission by the speaker, participants
		can append annotations being available to the public.
		Participants can send questions and remarks to the
		speaker without the need to interrupt the talk.
		<br>
		The required functionality is achieved by
		writing a suitable wrapper component in
		Java which profits from the OpenOffice.org API.
		To prevent from chaotic access by all participants,
		an existing infrastructure for role management and
		permissions is included. It allows different
		mechanisms and policies, e.g. a simple turn taking
		procedure under control of the speaker.
		As a whole, the presentation component of OpenOffice.org
		is enhanced by a collaborative mode.

		Historically, the code base that later became OOo
		was a large, rather monolithic C++ application.
		Then, some base layer of functionality was factored out,
		mainly to serve as a foundation for UNO-oriented processes
		(processes that host components which interact with other,
		distributed components within the UNO framework).
		For mostly technical reasons, that meant using C instead
		of C++ in some parts (mainly for APIs), and left us with
		a code base that is a mixture of C and C++. This state of
		affairs lead to a continuous stream of problems and frustrations
		when using or extending these base layers,
		and this talk will describe some of them, and explain how
		they can be solved.
		<br>
		First, I will give brief introductions to both the
		architecture of the OOo base layer under discussion
		(better known as the "UDK"), and the reasons why C++
		is often a better language than C when implementing or
		interfacing to some software component. Then, I will
		discuss some of the issues where the goals of the
		UDK collide with the use of C++, and what can be done about it:
		<br>
		<UL>
		<LI>Creating APIs that are robust against failure.
		<LI> Supporting process-global concepts like memory management.
		<LI> Using exception handling.
		<LI> Issuing improved versions of components while supporting
		a backwards-compatible, stable API.
		<LI> Building components that have minimal requirements
			on their hosting environment.
		<LI> Letting foreign components built with arbitrary
			C++ compilers use the UDK.
		<LI> Keeping the source code as platform-neutral as possible.

India supports a culturally and linguistically diverse population,
majority of whom are excluded from the productive usage of information
technology due to the lack of standardized and economical
Indian language enabled software.
<br>
OpenOffice.org is the leading office productivity suite through
open-source initiatives, available with a rich feature set across
all main platforms, along with internationalization and localization
support for major International languages. This paper examines the
development aspects, usage and prospects of OpenOffice.org
internationalized and localized to cater to the Indian market.
<br>
Most Indian scripts originate from the Brahmi script and follow complex
rules of layout involving consonants, vowels, special symbols,
conjuncts and ligatures. Unicode encoding for Indian languages
establishes a similar pattern among the scripts. In this paper,
we will examine this pattern and how the orthographic rules can be
used to develop Complex Text Layout algorithms for Indian scripts.
Also explored are storage and rendering aspects of Indian text,
along with font technologies suitable for Indian scripts.
<br>
The Internationalization(i18n) and Localization(l10n) framework
of OpenOffice.org sets guidelines for localization and
internationalization work of the suite in other languages.
The project .BharateeyaOO.o. (http://www.ncb.ernet.in/bharateeyaoo)
commenced on the lines of these frameworks, to achieve Indian
language support in OpenOffice.org. With initiatives for
localizations in major languages of India, Complex Text Layout support,
Indian locales, dictionary support and collation algorithms,
the project aims at a completely <i>Indianized</i> office suite
packaged economically for the Indian user.
This paper concludes with an insight into the development,
implementation details and progress of this project.

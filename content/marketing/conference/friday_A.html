            <td>The Mac OS X/Darwin port of OpenOffice.org is of
            the most politically charged ports, and probably for
            good reason: Mac users have very high
            expectations. This doesn't necessarily make
            for easy development however. In this talk, I will
            briefly review the history of the Mac OS X port, its
            current status, and its future directions before
            discussing the technical and some of the political
            sides of porting.<br />
            Working on and directing an OpenOffice.org port is no
            small task if the port is not one of the
            &quot;mainstream&quot;
            three. It requires a significant time
            investment for development, constant patch and source
            code management, effective communication, and infinite
            patience. One should not underestimate the
            time required for source code and build system
            management; it's quite
            high. Actual development time varies from
            platform to platform due to a number of factors, which
            will be discussed here: compatibility with
            the low-level OS layer, structure and fit with the
            native windowing system/interface, and availability of
            resources to name a few.<br />
            Even though an OpenOffice.org port actually runs on a
            platform it may not be ready for prime
            time. While the user interface normally
            kept as consistent as possible across all platforms,
            there are variations. Mac OS X users, for
            the most part, will not accept a gray, Windows-like X11
            interface. Therefore, a significant amount
            of work must be done to ensure the interface looks and
            works like any normal Mac application:
            native-style buttons, a fluid look and feel,
            integration with unique system services and
            conventions. Once this is done however, and
            done well, the battle is won.</td>

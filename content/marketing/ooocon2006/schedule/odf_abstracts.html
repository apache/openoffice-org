        <p class="by">Svante Schubert</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The editing of XML content with OpenOffice.org is a frequent requested task
        of users. But to be able to edit solely the content and not the XML as a simple
        textfile, a filter has to be established.</p>
        
        <p>This session should give a quick overview over the existing functionality
        OpenOffice.org offers to establish such a filter, giving powerful examples. 
        But also giving scenarios showing the current limitations to finally offer 
        ideas to the community to broaden the functionality.</p>

        <p class="by">Michael Brauer</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The &ldquo;OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument)
        &rdquo; (also known as ODF) was recently approved as ISO and IEC International 
        Standard ISO/IEC 26300, and its adoption is accelerating day by day.</p>

        <p>This presentation provides an overview of recent development in the OpenDocument
        space. It is divided into two parts. In the first part. it provides an inside 
        into the work of the OpenDocument TC in the last two years. It introduces the 
        charters and work programs of the new Accessibilty, Formula and Metadata subcommittees
        and reveals what the future plans of the TC and its subcommittees for OpenDocument are.</p>

        <p>In the second part, the presentation throws a glance on the adoption of
        OpenDocument. It shows which national and local public bodies have already 
        adopted OpenDocument, and where an adoption is in progress. The second part
        further introduces organizations and groups that provide assistance to parties
        that are interested in adopting OpenDocument and lists resources that provide 
        further information regarding OpenDocument.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Two XML office file formats have been pressing upon our attention, 
        the OASIS OpenDocument Format, recently standardized by ISO, and the 
        Draft Ecma Office Open XML. This presentation will review history
        of each, the process that created them, and examine each format to 
        compare and contrast how they deal with issues such extensibility, 
        modularization, expressivity, performance, reuse of standards, 
        programability, ease of use, and application/OS neutrality.</p>

        <p class="title">Innovation Opportunities with ODF XML</p>
        <p class="by">Douglas Heintzman</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Today, the ODF XML technology standard for document data is most closely 
        associated with office application suites that provide an alternative to 
        MS-Office. But ODF as an XML technology opens the gates for new programmatic 
        access to the document data held within. Previously, the value of document 
        data was by and large unrealized due to the closed nature of today&rsquo;s 
        predominant office application suite. All this is about to change.</p>

        <p>This presentation will illustrate how ODF XML, and related open programming
        technologies can benefit new types of solutions that effectively re-define how
        documents, and the data contained within may participate in the context of 
        business processes, their workflows and transactions. These new solutions may
        be deployed directly on the Internet and accessed by multiple runtimes: industry
        standard Web browsers, an Eclipse-based rich client platform runtime, or directly
        from an ODF editor runtime such as OpenOffice, KOffice, Sun Star Office or IBM
        Workplace. Users will be able to collaborate and interact with document data in
        ways never before possible. Brief demonstrations will be included.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Future advances in hardware performance will come from parallel execution
        rather than faster execution. However, in order to benefit from these advances,
        application code will need to change. Then, in what ways will OOo have to change
        so that it will count as a productive 21st century office suite? What languages
        will we be writing code in tomorrow, and what paradigms will we use? Will UNO 
        turn out a strategic advantage in moving forward, or will it become a burden? Is
        the UNO threading framework a step in the right direction? Where shall we start?

      <div class="content">
        <p>OpenOffice.org is not as monolithic as it might appear sometimes. Its internal
        architecture allows to work in one module without the necessity to change others.
        Some modules that build the framework and architecture of OpenOffice.org have an 
        influence on the other modules and working on any higher level module as e.g. the 
        Writer module is not possibly without understanding the basic modules and how they
        interact with the others.</p>

        <p>This presentation will outline the general software architecture of OpenOffice.org
        to enable interested developers to find their way into the code. It will also give
        hints to further documentation.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Startup time of OOo is not insignificant &ndash; everyone knows that. But 
        there are other large applications that look like starting instantly; what do 
        they do differently? Are they cheating? Or not?</p>

        <p>This talk will describe the cheating techniques used by others, and also the 
        ones that we do already (early feedback &ndash; startup notification, splash, 
        etc.; re-using a running instance; preloading an instance; ...)</p>

        <p>Where the cheating ends, we will talk about improvements and optimizations
        made by Novell, including some that did not find their way to the up-stream 
        OOo yet.</p>

        <p class="title">OpenOffice.org Performance Improvements</p>
        <p class="by">Xiaoyang Yu &amp; Michael Leibowitz</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>We looked at several factors that could help improve OpenOffice.org startup
        performance, especially on Linux. We focused on disk sub-system-level solutions
        to mitigate performance impact of several application-specific factors. At launch,
        especially on cold-start, the application makes significant scattered disk accesses,
        due to a combination of page-faults arising out of execution flow and dynamic 
        library loads interspersed with configuration reads and writes. We will therefore 
        focus on speedup techniques based on reducing the disk access penalty at startup.</p>

        <p>A systemic approach of minimizing seek penalties is to arrange data blocks used 
        during application start-up in an appropriate sequence on the disk. We will briefly
        describe our trace gathering and simulation environment for costing and optimizing 
        block order for a collection of application disk access traces. We will also discuss
        results and experiences for a prototype reordering scheme for the ext2 filesystem. 
        We will outline the design and progress on a post-install reordering utility for 
        OpenOffice.org, and conclude by presenting some initial ideas on extending and 
        generalizing this approach into an adaptive monitoring and optimizing mechanism 
        with kernel and file-system support.</p>

        <p>The second approach is a deep refactoring of configmgr using berkeleydb to, 
        in effect, coalesce configuration data into a contiguous disk block. A new backend,
        dbbe, accesses xml blobs stored in the database, avoiding multiple file reads. We 
        will discuss our experiences creating a new backend as well as further opportunities
        for optimizing configmgr.</p>

        <p class="by">Kay Ramme</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>More or less frequently people complain about OOo in respect to multi
        threading. Either because it is complicated to implement a service, or that
        there is only few documentation, or that the UNO API is not thread safe, or
        that it does not scale etc.</p>

        <p>The &ldquo;Cleaning Up OOo Multi Threading&rdquo; effort1 aims to put OOos
        usage of multiple threads on a solid base, while simplifying the implementation
        of thread related OOo respectively UNO code, eliminating anachronistic 
        constructs such as the Solar Mutex or the Main Thread Executor.</p>

        <p>This sessions gives a brief overview over OOos current usage of threads and
        how synchronization primitives are used to protect office code and data. It develops
        a solution of how to simplify thread related code development and where OOo should 
        head wrt its threading architecture2. It gives a brief overview of the UNO based 
        implementation of the suggested solution, how it works and how it has been 
        applied to OOo.</p>

        <p class="title">Modular Building, splitting the build</p>
        <p class="by">Caol&aacute;n McNamara</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>OpenOffice.org is a large monolithic build, and has a large output install
        image size. One problem of this is for distributions which want to ship bugfix
        updates to their users and customers. For most distributions the smallest
        addressable update unit is effectively that of src.rpm. All output rpms which 
        are generated from a given src.rpm are included in the update set.</p>
        
        <p>Other similiarly large monolithic build trees have been split into separately
        buildable modules e.g. x.org. This enables separate src.rpms to be created, and
        independant update builds of the afflicted src.rpms with consequently faster 
        builds for updates, and smaller update sizes. Here I outline a sample modular-build
        split of OpenOffice.org into OpenOffice.org-URE and the rest of OpenOffice.org.</p>
        
        <p>The target of the BOF is that by discussing the problem and a prototype sample 
        solution an understanding might be reached as to the viability to a universally
        acceptable modular build process.</p>

        <p class="by">Michael Leibowitz</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>We will detail a new system being developed for openoffice.org, that will
        allow automated testing of&nbsp; code changes and make life easier for QA. 
        This system, using build-bot, allows developers to submit their CWS or SVN 
        branch for building, testing, and install-set creation on different architectures
        and configurations. By including performance, code-quality, and correctness tests
        in the battery, we allow developers to track regressions across many platforms,
        without requiring those platforms in their possession. By making install sets 
        available from the build, we enable developers to submit their changes easily,
        even when they don&#39;t have the same platforms/build systems as QA.</p>

        <p>In addition, the automated nature of the system makes running these tests 
        easy and painless. The &ldquo;head&rdquo; branch can also be automatically 
        tested, giving a running regression for the project as a whole. With this system,
        we hope to make the process of making changes and getting them integrated

      <div class="content">
        <p>The session will give an overview of the OpenOffice.org extension infrastructure.</p>
        
        <p>The OpenOffice.org office suite gets more and more popular and the demand to
        customize or extend the existing functionality by own extensions is growing as well
        to integrate it in existing business workflows. Customized extensions can provide new
        functionality or can be the interface to other applications, e.g. integration in
        document management systems.</p>
        
        <p>But what are the requirements for the extensions infrastructure to provide a
        reliable framework for deploying and maintaining extensions for several versions
        of OpenOffice.org? Even that is important for ISV&#39;s to protect their intellectual
        property and to make it possible to run a business based on extensions and an 
        open source product.</p>
        
        <p>This session will try to cover this question. Requirements like licensing, 
        versioning, dependencies and others are discussed and the session will give an

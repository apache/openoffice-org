        <p class="title">Using OpenOffice.org as a redaction tool for office automation document</>
        <p class="by">Garnett Yeatts &amp; Boyd Fletcher</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The United States Joint Forces Command, USJFCOM, has developed an application 
        that leverages the Open Office technologies to assist in the redaction of office 
        automation documents. Redaction is the process of securely cleansing  (or preparing)
        a document for release and sharing. The solution also provides an  automated (batch)
        mechanism to convert MS Office to ODF and redact them. The redacted documents can be
        stored in MS Office format, ODF, or PDF.</p>

        <p>Secure Save allows users to continue to use familiar tools while allowing an
        organization to protect itself from external compromise due to malicious executable
        code and from accidental release (leakage) of information due to unseen information
        in documents. The Secure Save application can operate as either a OOo plugin for 
        individual document processing or as a standalone Java application for batching 
        processing. The secure save redaction options are controlled via site specific policy
        configuration files.</p>

        <p>Recent research into spreadsheet error rates are not enouraging (see Panko), 
        even experienced users make significant errors (off by over 5%) regularly.&nbsp;
        Even slight variances in implementation between different applications and different
        versions of applications compound the problem.&nbsp; Spreadsheet formulas are poor 
        documented functional programming languages.&nbsp; Despite the ongoing work in the 
        OpenDocument Formula subcommittee, and in Microsoft&#39;s ECMA TC45 standardization

        <p class="by">Bj&ouml;rn Milcke &amp; Pierre-Andr&eacute; Galmes</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Charts are used for visualizing data sets, e.g. numbers contained in the cells 
        of a spreadsheet. There are many kinds of charts to choose from (e.g. bar
        chart, pie chart, scatter chart). As the current chart implementation has become 
        unmaintainable over the years, the chart team has decided to redesign the chart 
        module from scratch and create a usable base for further development and integration
        of missing features.</p>

        <p>The new chart implementation is now gaining in maturity and is proving to be
        a valuable tool. The purpose of this presentation is therefore to showcase this
        brand new feature planned for one of the next releases. The presentation will focus
        on the new chart as seen from two points of view: the user&#39;s (new features)
        and the developer&#39;s (code design and API). Demos will be given to illustrate the
        various features.</p>

        <p class="title">WordForge - localisation infrastructure for everyone</p>
        <p class="by">Dwayne Bailey</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Localisation is hard. It&#39;s made harder because there is a high technical
        skill requirement to implement and integrate a localisation. A good translator,
        who is technically skilled enough to localise software, is also difficult to find.
        Now consider all this in relation to minority languages: no skilled resources and 
        few volunteer translators. Is this a recipe for mediocre localisations or an opportunity
        for software to help elevate quality and help us produce localisations for very small languages?</p>
        
        <p>There are over 200 languages in Africa with more than 1 million speakers. If 
        we want to see those in OpenOffice.org we need to dramatically improve the process 
        of localisation so that we can reduce the barriers to entry.</p>
        
        <p>The WordForge project is delivering localisation infrastructure that helps 
        localisation teams effectively manage their localisations by ensuring good process 
        and by imporoving quality through glossary management and translation reuse.</p>

        <p>WordForge is focused on using the localisation formats developed by the localisation
        industry including XLIFF, TMX and TBX. These standardised localisation formats add
        large amounts of value to FOSS projects and translation teams, through the embeding and 
        managment of the localisation process, terminology and translation memory. WordForge&#39;s 
        existing translation management system, Pootle, is being extending to manage XLIFF files.
        The present PO format does not allow effectively allow for this information to be 
        delivered to localisers.</p>
       
        <p>WordForge builds on the existing Translate Toolkit used by most OpenOffice.org 
        localisers and enhances the existing Pootle Translation Management Software. These 
        are real tools being expanded and enhanced by real localisers so that we can deliver 
        OpenOffice.org in many more languages.</p>

      <div class="bio">
        <p><strong>Dwayne Bailey</strong> started Translate.org.za which has translated 
        OpenOffice.org into the 11 official languages of South Africa. This effort has played no small part in 
        getting Microsoft to localise into 3 South African languages. He is part of the 
        team that built the oo2po convertor used by most OpenOffice.org localisation teams. Dwayne, 
        together with Javier Sola from the KhmerOS team, founded the WordForge project as a means 
        to help improve the quality of localisations as well as to help more minority languages 
        translate FOSS.</p>

        <p>This session is about how Beijing Bedflag Chinese 2000 Co. LTD., worked 
        hard to develop OpenOffice.org into a product RedOffice that would suit the 
        needs of Chinese business, including debugging OpenOffice.org, localizing the 
        information, Chinese typesetting, and developing lots of new fonctions for 
        the chinese customer.</p>

        <p>RedOffice has been excellent in government purchase from 2002 to now and its
        bid-winning ratio is more than 30%. Until now, RedOffice products have spread over
        more than twenty provinces and be widely used in various industries such as Water 
        Resource, Electrical Power, Tobacco, Mining, Iron and Steel Industry, etc.</p>

        <p>As an OpenOffice.org based software, RedOffice has a big market in China. Beijing

        overview of OOo help system, information on how to write, modify, and build help,
        how to localize or extend help. Common pitfalls when working with the help sources
        will also be addressed. Further discussion will focus on community collaboration
        aspects where the relation between the Sun-based help authors and the documentation
        community will be discussed with the goal of highlighting existing and potential 
        collaboration paths and tools. Finally, we will try to collect ideas about the future
        of OOo documentation and help, such as consolidation of documentation formats and the
        feasibility of alternative delivery vehicles.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>OpenOffice.org increasingly gets common and increasingly gets included
        in GNU/Linux dustibutions. Unfortunately the working relationship with the 
        free software community at large and especially the GNU/Linux distributions
        is not always as optimal as it can and there often are some stones in the 
        way for them when trying to package OpenOffice.org optimally.</p>

        <p>This Talk is intended to show those up and maybe to search ways for a 
        better working relationship in the future.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>This session would continue a tradition that began with the first OOoCon
        and provide an overview of the work done in the OpenOffice.org Project over
        the last year and an examination of where we anticipate going. The 
        discussion will touch both on the product and project: What OpenOffice.org 
        2.0.x (released on last year&#39;s anniversary) has accomplished and how the
        Project has evolved over the last year, in part because of the 
        product&#39;s accomplishments. The evolution has made the Project more
        open to developers and other contributors; it has also brought into focus our
        market position&mdash;and the responsibilities associated with it. I conclude
        this paper by examining the options available to us and suggesting a strategic
        plan for the coming years.</p>

        <p class="by">John McCreesh, Marketing Project Lead - OpenOffice.org</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The Marketing Project believes the next twelve months are crucial to the 
        development of OpenOffice.org. The product is better then ever. Microsoft is 
        losing the sympathy of several of its key markets, and OpenOffice.org is the 
        only realistic alternative. 2006 is UNESCO&#39;s year of Mother Languages in
        Cyberspace, and OpenOffice.org is uniquely poised to exploit the demand to 
        use software in mother languages. Public administrations and commercial 
        organizations are starting to realise the value locked in their office documents,
        and OpenOffice.org is the market leader in supporting ISO 26300 file formats.</p>

        <p>For all these reasons and more, OpenOffice.org is the answer - we know why we 
        use it; we need to get the message out to those who don&#39;t. At the same time, 
        the Community needs to increase its membership: developers, translators,advocates,
        end user support. We know why we volunteer to work in the Community - we need to 
        get that message out too.</p>
        
        <p>The Marketing Project is responding to this with a campaign &#39;why.openoffice.org&#39;.
        This session will explain the drivers behind the campaign and explain what every 
        conference delegate needs to know to go home and answer the question:&ldquo;Why
        OpenOffice.org?&rdquo; why should people in target markets like governments, SMEs,
        universities, schools, etc. implement OpenOffice.org? why should developers rise 
        to the challenge of working on the code? why should people volunteer to work in the
        Community?</p>

        <p><strong>John McCreesh</strong> had spent a lifetime in commercial IT before discovering open
        source during the dot-com boom. After dabbling in coding,,John realized he could
        do less damage to his pet open source projects by publicizing them rather than 
        hacking them. His interests have ranged over projects as diverse as qvwm, php, Rails,
        LTSP, Ubuntu, WordPress and of course OpenOffice.org, where he has been co-Lead of
        the Marketing Project for two years before becoming Lead in May 2006.John&#39;s

        <p class="title">Visual Identity of OpenOffice.org Now and in Future</p>
        <p class="by">Bernhard Dippold</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Since the release of OpenOffice.org 2.0 the office suite gets more and 
        more public attention all over the world. People should recognize as well 
        the product as the community not only by it&#39;s name but also by the 
        visual impression they get.</p>
          
        <p>If they get the same impression wherever they see any reference to 
        OpenOffice.org they should recognize it without reading the characters 
        &ndash; they should recognize it even if there aren&#39;t any characters
        at all.</p>

        <p>This &ldquo;Visual Identity&rdquo; is important for spreading public 
        awareness for OpenOffice.org and therefore we should try to include not 
        only the official OOo logo but specific bugs and symbols wherever we want
        to promote OpenOffice.org: in marketing materials, on web pages, documentations
        and so on.</p>

        <p>The main bug is the pair of stylized gulls from our logo (in right
        relative size and position), some other graphical elements are used to 
        refer to OpenOffice.org 2:
          <ul>
            <li>the blue-to-white gradient from the splash screen</li>
            <li>the &ldquo;wire gulls&rdquo; (from the splash screen, too)</li>
            <li>the colors of the program icons and the icons themselves</li>
            <li>the S-curve from the icons.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
          
        <p>The Art Project created proposals for an updated logo, program icons and 
        additional bugs to be used as official branding elements for OpenOffice.org 
        after the release of OpenOffice.org 3.</p>

        <p>This artwork will be presented to the community and hopefully will be discussed
        among the different projects involved in this topic: Art, Marketing, Website, 
        Documentation and as many Native Language Projects as possible.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>OpenOffice.org is free and should stay free (gratis). However, given the ambition of the project, we need to chart ways in which to monetize what is free, the product. We can charge for ancillary things, and this BOF would discuss options available to us. They include featuring ads in the downloads, getting support from interested companies, providing for-fee support (either directly or indirectly), licensing documentation for 3rd-party support, training, certification, ads, and so on. In short, a wide variety of options are available to us and these will help sustain our ambition.</p>

        <p class="by">RKVS Raman</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>The localization activities of OpenOffice.org in India (done largely 
        by BharateeyaOO.o group and other Open Source L10N contributers) is on 
        the verge of creating a revolution as far as adoption of OpenOffice.org
        goes in Indian Masses. Initialy started with an intention to provide a 
        BIPK (Basic Information Processing Kit) to general masses in Indian Languages,
        the ministry bundled OpenOffice.org along with other popular Open Source 
        Softwares and released them as Free Cds which could be obtained by any person
        by sending a simple mail. The languages that these Cds were released were in 
        Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. About 200,000 Cds have already been distributed apart 
        from making them available on the government website ( http://www.ildc.in ).
        The Ministry has promised that the Cds will be released in all 22 scheduled 
        Indian Languages and OpenOffice.org has cemented its place in the BIPK list.</p>
        
        <p>The popularity of the efforts and the quality of softwares is now making 
        some of the local OEMs (HCL, HP and Zenith) to consider pre-bundling 
        OpenOffice.org and other softwares. This helps them in reducing costs as 
        well as providing localized versions of the softwares. A National Resource 
        Centre for FOSS has been setup at Chennai India ( http://www.nrcfoss.org.in/ ).
        One of the mandates of NRCFOSS is to build a localized Debian based distro for 
        Indian Government and Educational Sector. OpenOffice.org forms a major part of 
        this software especially in the Government Sector. BharateeyaOO.o 
        ( http://www.cdacbangalore.in/bharateeyaoo ) is helping NRCFOSS in integrating 
        OpenOffice.org and certain other specific OOo macros into their installation set.
        Currently OpenOffice.org is avalable in 8 Indian Languages and more are in the 
        pipeline. In months to come OpenOffice.org is set to capture Indian Markets 
        in a big way.</p>

        <p class="by">Claudio Ferreira Filho</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Today, Brasil is a great example with regards to Free Software use and 
        adoption, from the regular user to the Federal Government. Inside this 
        adoption process, OpenOffice.org is one of the main tools, althought, there 
        is a particular aspect in its community development in the country.</p>
        
        <p>In Brasil, the project exists since 2001 and presented various problems, 
        from localization tasks to the trademark, creating a possible trap to our 
        users and developers. &quot;Open Office&quot; is a trademark registered in 
        1996, on the National Office of Trademarks and Patents, and considering 
        a legal position, it&#39;s not possible to use this name or derivated versions.</p>
        
        <p>The Brasilian Community generated critical mass and a support structure 
        for a number of users estimated in more than 7 million users, and with the
        trademark problem, preventive measures were taken to ensure the ongoing works,
        like the creation of a NGO called BrOffice.org, with the goal to collect resources
        to invest in infrastructure and developers in our country, both to OpenOffice.org
        and related projects, and beyond, to invest in projects that fights against 
        digital and social exclusion.</p>
        
        <p>Today, Brasilian Community, protected by the BrOffice.org trademark, keeps 
        promoting and expanding the user base, encouraging new developers and projects,
        technology, economicanl and cultural fixation.</p>

        <p>Specifications are an essential and central part of the OpenOffice.org

        Quality Assurance and Documentation.</p>

        <p>A team of three community members took a closer look at the specifications. 
        It turned out that the quality of specifications written for OpenOffice.org 2.0 
        is too low. Analysis of a subset of specifications and feedback gathered 
        from the community confirmed the correctness of this finding. Further the 
        OpenOffice.org specification process is considered intransparent, bloated, 
        and blocking. The team started fixing the issues by improving the specification

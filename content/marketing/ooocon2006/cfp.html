    <h3>Submiting</h3>

    <p style="text-align:left">Please submit a proposal by 
    <a href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/ooocon2006/paper_template.odt">filling
    out the template</a> and sending it to: 
    <a href="mailto:callforpapers@openoffice.org">callforpapers@openoffice.org</a></p>


    <p><strong>Note</strong>. As the OpenOffice.org community consists of members 
    from countries all over the world the talk must be in English.</p>
    
    <p><em>Please limit your presentation to <strong>50 minutes</strong>, 
    including questions.</em></p>


    <p>Your proposal (abstract) must be sent before <b>1 June 2006</b> in order 
    to be considered for inclusion in the Conference.</p>

    <p>A <em>presentation</em> is a general discussion of some topic, including 
    (but not limited to) the software, the community, relationships with other 
    software or communities, and political or philosophical issues.</p>

    <p>A <em>case study</em> is a specific type of presentation that tells what you
    did to achieve some result; this is usually a success story, but could 
    include a discussion of what mistakes you made and how you overcame them.</p>

    <p>A <em>workshop</em> is a "how-to" session, in which the presenter gives 
    step-by-step instructions for doing some task such as writing macros,
    setting up a database, or developing a complex spreadsheet. Workshops 
    usually include some audience activities.</p>

    <p>A <em>BoF</em> ("Birds of a Feather" meeting) is an informal gathering of 
    people in a particular group, or interested in a specific topic. Examples
    include the members of a native-language group, the marketing project, 
    documentation writers, or Macintosh coders.</p>

    <p>A <em>panel discussion</em> involves a group of people (usually 3 or 4) led 
    by a moderator. The participants make opening and closing statements on
    the topic, may discuss the topic among themselves, and may answer questions
    from the audience (usually submitted in advance).</p>

    <p>A <em>lightning talk</em> is a brief presentation on any topic 
    relevant to the conference. It could be an interesting format to give 
    many people the chance to make their point in a series of exactly 5 
    minute slots.</p>

    <p>The template for paper submission includes a section for requesting a
    travel subsidy. At this point we are not in a position to offer funding 
    for all speakers, and those speakers who do get a subsidy are unlikely to 
    have their full expenses covered. Each request will be considered on the
    basis of both merit and need, so if you are requesting a subsidy, please 
    give as much information as possible to help us evaluate your request. 
    Please note that someone presenting only a lightning talk is unlikely to 
    receive assistance.</p>

    <p>An OpenOffice.org Impress template recommended for use for the
    conference presentations will be published around 1 June 2006.</p>

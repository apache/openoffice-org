<h2>OpenOffice.org Process Inventory II</h2>
<p>Jeff Love, Louis Su&aacute;rez-Potts</p>
<p><i>Last modified 28 June 2001</i></p>
<p><br>
  This document is a modified version of one Jeff Love wrote for NetBeans's migration. 
  I have modified it to fit OpenOffice.org. The document contains a list of common 
  tasks currently undertaken by OpenOffice.org project owners and admins, and 
  a description of how that task will be completed in SourceCast. </p>
<p><b>NB</b> If an important element has been missed, please let me know: <a href="mailto:louis@openoffice.org ">louis@openoffice.org</a>. 
  Comments and questions should also be sent to me. If I cannot answer a question, 
  I will defer it to Jeff Love, who is leading the upgrade.</p>
<h4><B><br>
  <br>
  User Tasks</B></h4>
<p>Registering</p>
<p>How it is done now: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Admin account created by member granting access</li>
  <li>Issuezilla account created by User</li>
</ul>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: User creates own account; unified 
  issuezilla, admin and cvs access in one user</P>
<p>How to do it in SourceCast</P>
<ul>
  <li>On Home Page, click <A href="//servlets/Join">Register 
    Now</A></li>
  <li>Enter in chosen username, email address (must be valid), Real Name, Organization 
    (if desired)</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Register&quot;</li>
  <li>Once you press &quot;Register&quot;, you will see the login screen and a 
    password will be send to your email address.</li>
  <li>As soon as you receive your password, copy it into a clipboard space</li>
  <li>Go to Home Page and enter username and password and hit enter</li>
  <li>You will be put onto &quot;My Home Page&quot;</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Edit Profile&quot; Link</li>
  <li>Type in chosen password</li>
  <li>Retype chosen password</li>
  <li>Click Submit Changes</li>
</ul>
<h4>When do I need to Register/Login?</h4>
<p>How it is done now: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Browsing Web Content: No login needed</li>
  <li>CVS access: No account needed to download repository (anoncvs). Must have 
    admin account created by other member to gain COMMIT access to the repository.</li>
  <li>IssueZilla access: Users create accounts themselves . Admin privileges granted 
    by other Issuezilla admins</li>
  <li>Admin Access: Users don't request admin access themselves -- they must be 
    created by other members -- control/create mailing lists, projects,etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: Users create accounts themselves 
  and then are approved by a SourceCast Administrator; Logging in is assumed to 
  be much more frequent than in Tigris. Assumptions are made once you have logged 
  in to SourceCast that presents certain information to you on &quot;My Start 
  Page&quot; based on the projects that you are a part of (such as news and your 
  project links and links to your issues on that project); If Developer or Content 
  Developer, allows write access to project resources, but not to configure those 
  resources; If role on project is project Owner -- user has access to configure 
  all project resources</P>
<p>How to do it in SourceCast</P>
<ul>
  <li>Browsing Web Content: No login needed</li>
  <li>CVS access: No account needed to download repository (anoncvs). Commit access 
    requires an account with Developer, Content Developer (HTML only) or project 
    Owner status on a project</li>
  <li>Issuezilla: No login needed to QUERY and CHANGE existing bugs. Login necessary 
    to lodge new bugs</li>
  <li>Admin Access: Always be logged in to have administrative access</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Downloading the CVS Repository</h4>
<p>How it is done now: </p>

  <li>Command Line or GUI client - set CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.services.OpenOffice.org:/cvs</li>
  <li>cvs login</li>
  <li>password: (no password, just hit enter)</li>
  <li>cvs co -c (list all projects available)</li>
  <li>cvs co all (or project name, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: None</P>

  <li>Command Line or GUI client - set CVSROOT=:pserver:&lt;username&gt;@OpenOffice.org:/cvs</li>
  <li>cvs login</li>
  <li>password: (username's password, hit enter)</li>
  <li>cvs commit &lt;filename&gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Joining a project</h4>
<p>How it is done now: </p>
<ul>
  <LI>Not done explicitly in Tigris now. Users are granted commit access to the 
    entire repository by a project owner.</LI>
</UL>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: </P>
<ul>
  <li>Users who actively participate should &quot;Join a project&quot;</li>
  <li>this will signify that they are actively participating on the project;</li>
  <li>It will put the user in the &quot;Members&quot; section of the project Resources 
    header</li>
  <li>Give them commit access if they request a Developer Role</li>
  <li> Make the project show up as a link in the &quot;My projects&quot; section 
    of the &quot;My Start Page&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>How to do it in SourceCast</P>
<ul>
  <li>click Join This project on the far right side of the screen in the project 
    Home page</li>
  <li>which takes you to the project Membership Request page.</li>
  <li>The radio buttons in the middle of the page present you with several role 
    options.</li>
  <li>Think of the roles as a method of informing the project owner of how you 
    intend to contribute. You may request, or even be asked, to fulfill more than 
    one role at some point, and you can certainly fulfill other roles on different 
    projects.</li>
  <li>To select a project role, click on the radio button to the left of the desired 
    role and click on the Submit Request button at the end of the list of roles. 
  </li>
  <li>The project Owner will then need to approve or disapprove this role and 
    you will receive an email from the project owner when this action has been 
    taken.</li>
  <li>Once you are a project member and your involvement progresses, you may wish 
    to change your role in a project. </li>
  <li>The project Home page includes a Request New project Role link in the top 
    right corner of the same page you originally used to request membership in 
    the project. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Choosing Role in a project</h4>
<p>How it is done now: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Not done explicitly in Tigris now. Users are granted commit access to the 
    entire repository by a project owner.</li>
</ul>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: The role that you choose on a project 
  both signifies to the community what type of participation you have on the project 
  as well governs what types of commit access (Developer or Content Developer)or 
  access to administrative functions you will have (project Owner);</P>
<p>How to do it in SourceCast:</P>
<p>The following details the various permission that the roles you have the option 
  to choose from carry:</P>
<b>Observer</b><br>
<ul>

    documentation, source code, issue tracking). 
  <li>Read-only access to most project resources. 
  <li>Read-only access to web content and source code (CVS). 
  <li>Submits issue to issue tracking (IssueZilla) 
  <li>Subscribes and posts to project mailing lists. 
</ul>
<p><b>Developer</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Contributes directly to project -- source code and HTML. 
  <li>Gains write access (with approval from project Owner) to most project resources. 
  <li>Write access to HTML, news utility, files utility, CVS, Issuezilla. 
  <li>Mailing list privileges the same. 
</ul>
<p><b>Content Developer</b><br>
<ul>

  <li>Gains write access to project's HTML, news utility with project Owner approval, 
    files utility with project Owner approval, and Issuezilla. 
  <li>Mailing list privileges the same. 
</ul>
<p><b>project Owner</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Defines the project's overall mission, direction, methodology, and community 
    make-up. 
  <li>Gains administrative access to all project functions. 
  <li>Grants members requested permissions on project. 
  <li>Administers all project mailing lists and is default moderator on all lists. 
  <li>Administers Issuezilla. 
  <li>project Owner role supersedes any other roles you may hold on a project. 
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Creating a News Item</h4>
<p>How it is done now: </p>
<ul>
  <LI>Creating Static HTML page usually news.html in www/ directory of the project</LI>
  <LI>Slightly heavyweight for sending out quick news items to project members</LI>
</ul>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: The news utility allows for lightweight 
  news communication among project participants without having to write html; 
  Users who are Members in the project will have current News items displayed 
  for them on &quot;My Start Page&quot;</P>
<p>How to do it in SourceCast</P>
<ul>
  <li>If Content Developer or Developer, user can &quot;Suggest News Item&quot; 
    and the project Owner will approve or disapprove the item once they log on</li>
  <li>If project Owner, user can post news item themselves</li>

  <li>Click &quot;Add News Item&quot; button</li>
  <li>If Content Developer or Developer, item will remain in the Pending Actions

  <li>If project Owner, news item gets posted immediately to Members &quot;My 
    Start Page&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Posting Large files for Download</h4>
<p>How it is done now: </p>

</UL>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: File utility is included to allow

  <li>If you wish this item to be public -- check the box -- in almost all cases 
    for OpenOffice.org the file should be public, but if for instance you are 
    uploading a draft of something you don't wish to be public right away it would 
    be advantageous to keep it private</li>
  <li>Click &quot;Upload File&quot; button</li>
  <li>if Content Developer or Developer, item will remain in the Pending Actions 
    section of the project Owner's &quot;My Start Page&quot; until Owner takes 
    action</li>
  <li>If project Owner, news item gets posted immediately to File section of the 
    project Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Posting Documentation for Download</h4>

<ul>
  <LI>posted in CVS (which wastes space)</LI>
  <LI> or uploaded to http://www.OpenOffice.org/downloads/ directory by webmasters</li>

</ul>
<p>General Differences (if any) in SourceCast: Documentation utility is included 
  to allow the categorization and display of documents that does not need to be 
  part of the main web content; uploading documentation for download without committing 
  them to CVS; uploading files is a GUI front end;</P>

<p>How to do it in SourceCast</P>
<p> Once a user&nbsp;becomes a member of a project, he&nbsp;or she&nbsp;is granted 
  additional IssueZilla permissions beyond the default database query capabilities. 
  Permissions can be viewed by&nbsp;clicking on the&nbsp; <strong>My Preferences</strong> 
  link on the <b>project Issues</b> page, or the <strong>Edit Prefs </strong> 
  link in the Issue Tracking toolbar. 
<p> Issue tracking permissions depend upon project role:&nbsp; 
<ul>
  <li>Observers can&nbsp;create and modify issues, but&nbsp;can make changes to&nbsp;only 
    their own issues. Observers have the ability to comment on any issue.&nbsp; 
    <p></p>
  <li>Developers&nbsp;(code or content) can report and modify&nbsp;their own and 
    other project&nbsp; issues. If they have been granted&nbsp;the "Can edit all 
    aspects of any issue" permission, they have the ability to alter all issue 
    characteristics, including milestones and issue assignments. 
    <p></p>
  <li>project initiators automatically are granted&nbsp;administrative level IssueZilla&nbsp; 
    permissions&nbsp;with additional&nbsp;rights to configure issue tracking for 
    the&nbsp;project.&nbsp;project initiators can also assign IssueZilla-specific 
    permissions to other project members.</li>
</ul>
Additional permissions can be requested through the project owner.&nbsp;You may 
need to request a new project role.

<p> 
<UL>
  <LI>You can subscribe or unsubscribe to mailing lists for a particular project 
    by selecting "Mailing Lists" in the project Resources tool bar. </LI>
  <LI> The <b>project Mail</b> page includes subscribe/unsubscribe links for either

<ul>
  <li>Browse Static HTML pages generated by Monharc</li>
  <li>Messages are in this static form which makes it harder to search for particular 
    pieces of mail</li>
</ul>

  better search facility</P>
<p>How to do it in SourceCast</P>
<ul>
  <li> To view a mailing list's archives, select the <strong>Mailing List</strong> 
    option in the project Resources tool bar to see a list of all mailing lists 
    for that project. </li>
  <li> Click on the <strong>View Archive </strong>link next to the list you want 
    to view. </li>

    Boolean operators. </li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Note: project/component mailing list archiving is handled by <a href="http://eyebrowse.tigris.org/"> 
    EyeBrowse</a>, an open source tool that stores and indexes list messages, 
    providing multiple options for browsing, reading, and searching mailing list 
    archives via a web browser. Beyond storing messages, EyeBrowse adds a database 
    and text indexing engine to handle rapid message search and retrieval. </li>

<p>How to do it in SourceCast</p>
<ul>
  <li> You must be a registered user and you must be logged in to start a project. 
  </li>
  <li>Creating a new project on this site is fairly straightforward. You should, 
    however, come to the task prepared, with a good sense of what you want and 
    how you want to accomplish it. Knowing whom to invite onto your project won't 
    hurt, either. </li>
  <li>Choose the Start a project link on &quot;My Start Page&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Create New project Step 1</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p>The fields available on the &quot;Start a project&quot; page allow you 
      to configure your project. Below, we have explained each of the fields and 
      their function. </p>
    <P> 
    <P> 
    <blockquote><B>project Name</B> Enter what you wish to call your project. 
      Choose a name that both describes the project and conforms to the naming 
      conventions. That is, use the a-z, 0-9, and dash (but not as the first character); 
      no spaces, underscoring, capitalization, or other punctuation. Keep in mind 
      that the project name cannot be changed. An example of a name for a project 
      dealing with porting a sophisticated chess game to the telephone might be 
      &quot;chessphone.&quot; Unimaginative, to be sure, but descriptive. 
      <p></P>
      <P><B>Summary</B><BR>
        Enter a one-line description of your project, no longer than the field 
        length. The description should be in plain text; HTML and formatted text 
        are not supported. The description will be adjacent to the name of the 
        project and be what registered users see first when they view the list 
        of available projects. It should therefore be descriptive and concise. 
        For instance, in the case of the chess game, you might write: &quot;Porting 
        an advanced chess game to the phone.&quot; Unlike the project name, you 
        can edit this field at any time.</P>
      <P><B>Description</B><BR>
        This description makes up the bulk of your project's home page. It is 
        where you can present the project in as interesting a light as possible. 
        You can include HTML, formatted text, and so on, but keep in mind that 
        most developers prefer simple and fast over complicated and slow (and 
        confusing). State here your project's mission, background, methodology, 
        tasks available, and other information that a developer might need to 
        begin working on your project. This field can be edited at any time by 
        clicking on the &quot;Edit project&quot; link once you have finished creating 
        a project, but the information should remain consistent.

      <P><B>License</B><BR>
        The current licenses will be available for OpenOffice.org.</p>
      <P><B>project Category</B><BR>
        Select the category appropriate for your project. Because projects are 
        listed by category in both the Start Page and project Home pages, the 
        choice of category is critical for giving developers a sense of the kind 
        of work available. A developer who specializes in games, for example, 
        will not necessarily want to view projects in the productivity category. 
        As you can see, there are many possible options, and if you end up preferring 
        another category, you can change your project category at any time. To 
        edit this features of your project, click on &quot;Edit project&quot; 
        once you have finished creating the project.</p>
      <P><B>project Profile</B><BR>
        The project Profile buttons are configured to automatically create mailing 
        lists for your particular project. Perhaps you have a project idea that 
        will require much discussion and input from other developers well before 
        getting to the point of actual source code; this would be a "Discussion 
        project." If your project, on the other hand, involves reworking existing 
        source code, choose "Standard development project." Selecting a content 
        project generates one general mailing list; you would not have access 
        to the issue-tracking system because it would not be necessary. Selecting 
        the standard project profile generates five mailing lists, and gives you 
        access to all of the other resources of the site, including issue tracking. 
        It is important to stress that no matter what profile you choose, you 
        can change it later.</p>

    <blockquote><b>People To Invite</b><br>
      Invite as many people as you wish by listing their email addresses, one 
      email address per line, or multiple addresses if each address is separated 
      by a comma, colon, or semicolon. Automatically generated invitations to 
      each invitee will be sent; you can use the field below to include a personal 
      message, perhaps a brief explanation of your project's purpose, why you 
      think he or she might find it worthwhile to join in, and a link providing 
      direct access to your project home page. 
      <p>Recipients of your invitation who are already registered with this site 
        log in to view your project home page. To join your project, they click 
        the "Join This project" link.</p>
      <p>If the person you're inviting is <i>not</i> registered with this site, 
        the email invitation asks her to register first to obtain a login and 
        password by email. Then this person is able to log in and view your project 
        home page.</p>
      <P> <B>Invitation Message</B><BR>
        This message should be brief, but clear and informative. You can include 
        hyperlinks, and any other information that you think would promote your 
        project. Formatting and HTML are not, however, supported--the message, 
        that is, stands on what it says not on how it looks. Hint: write out what 
        you want to say beforehand. That way, you won't be lost for words. Finally, 
        all the other project information is automatically generated, so you don't 
        have to worry about including it again.</P>

    <p>When you finish filling out all the fields and writing the messages, click 
      <b>Finish,</b> which takes you to the confirmation page. From there, you 
      can go to your newly created project home page. 
    <p>While your project's status is pending, you can do many things to enhance 
      your project's appeal. You can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Customize your project home page content 
      <li>Add, configure, or delete mailing lists 
      <li>Upload source files and documents 
      <li>Invite additional participants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, you can use most of the project functionality while waiting for 
      project approval. Once your project is approved, you can accept member requests 
      to begin building your project team.</p>

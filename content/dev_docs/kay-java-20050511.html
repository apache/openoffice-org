<p> Guys, </p>
<p> There seem to be reoccurring discussions regarding OOos Java usage, e.g. see </p>
<p><a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/open-office-java.html">http://www.fsf.org/news/open-office-java.html</a> [and] <a href="//servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=13179"> //servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=13179 </a></p>
<p> I am really convinced, that we did everything to enable anybodies Java (even none at all), by </p>
<p> a) defining OOos Java usage policy (see <a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/policies/java_usage.html">http://tools.openoffice.org/policies/java_usage.html</a> ) </p>
<p> b) by implementing the Java Vendor framework (see <a href="http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/spec/javavendorextension.sxw">http://udk.openoffice.org/common/man/spec/javavendorextension.sxw</a> ) </p>
<p> c) by providing help when needed in respect to some legacy code, which partly makes use of some undocumented sun classes </p>
<p> and d) by certainly ensuring that OOo even runs without Java properly (e.g. Java can be deselected during the build process, leaving out Java based features, e.g. applets) </p>
<p> I would appreciate, if you can provide the latest state of the GCJ builds and if there are any obstacles left, which can not easily be fixed by some lines of code. We are certainly willing, and it will be a pleasure, to help and to work together with you to sort these issues out. </p>

<p> Thanks in advance </p>

<p>
The purpose of this paper is to provide a technical overview of the OpenOffice.org source
project.
<p>
It is expected that as the OpenOffice.org source project matures, some of these details will
evolve. This document will be updated periodically to reflect the nature of these changes
to the OpenOffice.org source project. If you would like to contribute to any updates to
this document, please join the OpenOffice.org general mailing list (www.openoffice.org).
<p>
The names used in this document for OpenOffice components, such as "OpenOffice.org
wordprocessor application" are placeholders. The OpenOffice.org community will
ultimately decide what these final names will be. This document will be updated when
the component names have been finalized.

<br>
<font SIZE="5">Summary</font>
<p>
Through the OpenOffice.org source project, Sun Microsystems is open-sourcing the
technology that powers its StarOffice[tm] office productivity application suite. Sun
recognizes that the open source community expects openness, interoperability, and
adherence to standards and, now that the underlying technology of the StarOffice suite
will be available to the community in the form of the OpenOffice.org sources and
binaries, Sun presents in this document the OpenOffice.org suite's technological
foundations and where they stand with respect to these expectations.
<p>
The OpenOffice.org suite's high level of interoperability derives from the standards it
supports as well as its premier import/export interfaces with the various office
productivity applications produced by Microsoft. The OpenOffice.org suite employs a
component-based development system that exemplifies all the important characteristics of
Component Ware - consistent interface allocation, support for important component
standards, transparent localization components, batch job capability, and platform
independence.
<p>
OpenOffice.org's component technology is open, object oriented, interface based, and
independent of both platform and development system. The OpenOffice.org API is
version independent, scalable, durable, and re-applicable. Because the component
technology is used in its implementation, the OpenOffice.org API is programming
language independent.
<p>
XML replaces binary as OpenOffice.org's file format and becomes the suite's new native
file format. Sun and OpenOffice.org are positioning XML, with its extremely high
standards profile, as the next standard for exchange of office documents.

<br>
<font SIZE="5">OpenOffice.org Components</font>
<p>
<a NAME="5"></a><font SIZE="5">OpenOffice.org Suite</font>
<p>
OpenOffice.org is a unified suite of productivity applications for all common office
applications, including such functions as word processing, spreadsheets, drawings,
presentations, data charting and formula editing. All components of the suite employ the
same user interface concepts and underlying technology. They interoperate closely with
one another, supporting features like inter-application copy-and paste and drag-and-drop
for creating compound documents. It is straightforward to embed a spreadsheet in a text
document, for example. They also interoperate well with other common desktop
productivity application suites, including the various office productivity applications
produced by Microsoft, for ease of document exchange. A scripting environment called
OpenOffice.org Basic is supported in all OpenOffice.org components to automate work or
build solutions.</p>
<p>
<a NAME="6"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org wordprocessor application <sup>1</sup></font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org wordprocessor application is a powerful tool for creating
professional documents, reports, newsletters, and brochures. It is easy to integrate images
and charts in documents, create business letters and extensive text documents with
professional layouts, as well as create and publish Web content.</p>
<p>
Footnote:
<p>
1 Component names are placeholders and will be replaced with actual names when said names are
finalized; see the Preface for more information.
<p>
<a NAME="7"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org spreadsheet application features decision making analysis tools for
performing advanced spreadsheet functions and data analysis. Charting tools generate
presentation applicationive, high-quality 2D and 3D charts.
<p>
<a NAME="8"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org presentation application</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org presentation application is a tool for creating multimedia
presentations. Included are 2D and 3D clipart, special effects animation, and high-impact
drawing tools.
<p>
<a NAME="9"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org drawing application</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org drawing application is a vector-oriented drawing module that enables
the creation of dynamic 3D illustrations and special effects.
<p>
<a NAME="10"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org data charting application</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org data charting application presents complex data in visually
presentation applicationive ways, from colorful 3D charts to simple pie, bar, and line
diagrams.
<p>
<a NAME="11"></a><font SIZE="5">System Integration</font>
<p>
The overarching goal for the OpenOffice.org suite is to provide a comprehensive set of
solutions for all office related functionality in an open world. The focus for all
OpenOffice.org components is office functionality.
<p>
This is the reason why all office components should provide a perfect integration into
already existing environments. Instead of competing with already accepted applications,
the OpenOffice.org source project will provide the flexibility to use the office
functionality in these applications as integrated parts. This will allow the use, for
example, of office productivity files from a variety of vendors, including Microsoft, as
mail attachments on every platform. In the future, it will also open up a way to build
highly sophisticated applications and solutions with integrated office functionality.
<p>
Future releases of the OpenOffice.org applications should provide the flexibility to use
different messaging components for Mail and News or let the user decide which tools he
wants to use to explore the filesystem, while at the same time the office components can
be an integrated part inside this application to deal with word-processing, spreadsheet,
etc. related content.
<p>
Some technology used in the StarOffice product was licensed from other companies.
Accordingly we are not able to provide the following technologies as Open Source under
the OpenOffice.org source project:
<ul>
<li>Bristol XPrinter - printing on UNIX ® platforms
<li>L&amp;H International CorrectSpell, Intl. Electronic Thesaurus - spell checking,
international dictionaries &amp; thesaurus
<li>Inso Word for Word - document filters for document formats other than MS Office
<li>Adabas D - database engine</li>    
</ul>
<p>
Future releases of the OpenOffice.org components may provide open source replacement
for these parts, which will provide similar functionality.
<p>
<a NAME="12"></a><font SIZE="5">CHAPTER 3</font>
<br>
<font SIZE="5">Interoperability</font>
<p>
For exchanging information it is important that two individuals have a common language.
For exchange electronic information today it is not hard to transport this information to
different system, instead the problem is in most cases that users use different applications
to do their work and to create content. So very often in the domain of office productivity
you can only read the document with the same application you created the content,
because the file format are proprietary. In some case it is also required to use the same
release of the application, the same operation system release or run this on the same
platform.
<p>
To give the user the freedom to use applications and the system which is appropriate for his
work, it is important that the system is able to handle a widespread set of file formats.
Especially for word-processing, spreadsheet, presentation it is often necessary to be able
to read the different binary formats used by the various office productivity applications
produced by Microsoft.
<p>
On the other hand interoperability is not only necessary for content. It is also necessary
that the components which are able to process the different file formats can be used in an
heterogeneous environment to build up solutions. Otherwise you would be locked into
another application space. Today's software technology is moving forward from having
libraries to component technology, which will not only allow using different programming
languages to build solutions, instead it will in most cases support using a scripting
language to provide the logical glue between high-level component build rapidly easy
adaptable software solutions.
<p>
<a NAME="13"></a><font SIZE="5">File Formats</font>
<p>
One of our primary objectives is to provide interoperability with existing solutions in the
same application domain. We support a wide range of standard file formats such as
HTML, RTF, GIF, and JPEG as well as Microsoft's proprietary file formats because of
their widespread use. OpenOffice.org provides the highest quality document import and
export functionality for the various office productivity applications produced by
Microsoft.

<a NAME="14"></a><font SIZE="5">Component Technology</font>
<p>
Despite the rise of the graphical user interface and a constant flow of new innovations in
the software industry, software development has become only more complicated over the
years. Creating high quality applications increases demands on the user, which in turn
lead to more and more expendable programs. Component based program development
systems promise a welcome change in this trend. They are based on the JavaBeans
architecture or the Component Object Model (COM), which are also called Component
Ware. The programmer can access previously prepared components (building blocks)
with these products, and use them in applications. The components are ready for
immediate use once they have been adapted to the operational area.</p>
<p>
The authors of the StarOffice product experienced this situation three years ago when
developing a new software architecture, which for the first time made an office suite
available on different platforms for use as an important building block. In the subsequent
planning and development period, a need for the following attributes in this new
architecture was realized:
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">Consistent Interface Allocation</font><br>
An important aspect in Component Ware development is the way the overall
application is dissected into individual units. The programmer must be offered exactly
the needed number of single components. The more complex the application, the more
difficult it is to distribute these components reasonably. The simpler and more logical
the application, the higher its acceptability.
<li><font SIZE="4">Support for Various Component Standards</font><br>
While the COM standard in Windows software is the most widely known component
standard, the JavaBeans components and CORBA interfaces are among the most
common in the professional business field and are accepted as standards in the open
world. Since there is not yet a general established industry standard in this area for all
platforms, the component model has to provide bridges between these different
technologies.
<li><font SIZE="4">Localization-Transparent Components</font><br>
Current Component Ware extensions should take advantage of the network for
component communication. Pure client components are inapplicable for modern
network use. Modern Component Ware must allow for delegation of a portion of an
application to a central server. On the other hand, components running locally on a
desktop system should not lose performance because of network communication
protocols when all components are running on one machine.
<li><font SIZE="4">Batch Job Ability</font><br>
Previous Component Ware products employed a visual and user fixed basic approach
for batch operations. User queries with hard coded components can bring the complete
server operation to a halt. For batch operations within the server it should be possible
to process content without requiring a visual representation.
<li><font SIZE="4">Platform Independence</font><br>
Especially in these times of 
  network computers and operating system upheaval, it is important that modern 
  Component Ware be able to select a platform independent extension. The 
  interface should be defined in a platform independent way so that program code 
  can be easily ported.</li>
            
           
            
     
</ul>
<a NAME="15"></a><font SIZE="5">The OpenOffice.org Component Technology</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org suite provides a component technology named Universal Network
Objects, which adheres to all these requirements of modern Component Ware and it is
formed on the Object Technology level, which is the basis upon which the OpenOffice.org
API is set up.
<p>
This component technology is:
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">Open</font><br>
It supports all the popular component standard communication protocols such as
CORBA, JavaBeans, OLE Automation (Windows Scripting Host, Visual Basic,
Delphi, and so forth), JavaScript, Phyton, Perl, etc. scripting languages, as well as
native integration in the C++ and C programming languages.
<li><font SIZE="4">Object Oriented</font><br>
It is object oriented and therefore supports concepts such as aggregation, inheritance,
exception handling and polymorphism.
<li><font SIZE="4">Interface Based</font><br>
Its functions are integrated into various interfaces. Function areas of similar structures
have access to the same interfaces, so that the programmer can easily feel at home in
the component world.
<li><font SIZE="4">Platform Independent</font><br>
It is specified to be platform independent and is available on all platforms that run
OpenOffice.org.
<li><font SIZE="4">Exception Able</font><br>
It offers exception ability, which means that it can allow itself to be mapped onto the
inserted development system mechanism - for example onto C++ Exceptions and Java
Exceptions.
<li><font SIZE="4">Development System Independent</font><br>
It can be used with all current development environments and programming
languages, including C++, C, Visual Basic, Windows Scripting Host and all systems
which support COM, CORBA, JavaBeans components, and OLE Automation.
<li><font SIZE="4">Network Able</font><br>
Components based on the component 
  technology can communicate on a network and can also delegate functions on a 
  remote server, for example, to offer access to the complete text processing 
  functions on Internet appliances.</li>
           
              
      
</ul>
<p>
<a NAME="16"></a><font SIZE="5">CHAPTER 4</font>
<br>
<font SIZE="5">Openness</font>
<p>
Opening up all specification, file formats, technologies and last but not least the source
code, will help ensure that no one can be locked into an application, platform or
environment space. But just providing all this information to everyone is not enough.
Openness will also required that already existing open standards and technologies were
used when ever appropriate and also the project over time will evolve newer technologies
and adapt other open standards.</p>
<p>
<a NAME="17"></a><font SIZE="5">XML File Format</font>
<p>
We adopted XML to replace the old binary file format and become the OpenOffice.org
suite's new native file format. Our goals were twofold: to have a complete specification
encompassing all components, and to provide an open standard for office documents. One
single XML format applies to different types of documents - e.g., the same definition
applies for tables in texts and in spreadsheets. XML is ideal as an open standard because
of the free availability of XML specifications and DTDs, and XML's support for XSL,
XSLT, Xlink, SVG, MathML, and many other important and emerging standards.
<p>
Beside replacing the binary file format with XML, the OpenOffice.org suite will use XML
internally for exchanging any type of content between the different applications.
OpenOffice.org provides today an infrastructure for using different XML components.
The XML-Parser and the XML-Printer are all implemented as components. Every of
these component support the Simple API for XML (SAX). This infrastructure will allow
in the future to dynamically configure a pipelines of different XML components, like
XML-Parser, XSLT-Processor, etc. to process XML-Input and Output. This will allow
transformation of XML-Data into different formats on the fly, without storing
intermediate files and parse them again for every transformation step.
<p>
<a NAME="18"></a><font SIZE="5">Application Programming Interfaces</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org API is based on the OpenOffice.org component technology and
consists of a wide range of interfaces defined in a CORBA-like IDL.
While the component technology determines how the components or applications
communicate with each other, the OpenOffice.org API defines the interface for accessing
office functionality from different programming languages. This interface structure is very
important in determining the degree to which re-application of a development is possible.
<p>
The interfaces defined by the OpenOffice.org API are characterized as follows:
<ul>
<li>They are completely defined component <b>interfaces</b> with the environment.
<li>They are <b>version independent</b> and <b>scalable</b>.
<li>They are <b>durable</b>.
<li>They are <b>re-applicable</b>.</li>
</ul>
Unlike other office suite APIs, the OpenOffice.org API does not simply reflect the
features of preexisting implementations. Rather, it has been designed from the viewpoint
of application and component developers. It offers programming interfaces for nearly all
OpenOffice.org components and makes it possible to integrate new components.
<p>
<a NAME="19"></a><font SIZE="4">Application Areas</font>
<p>
There are multiple ways to use OpenOffice.org APIs. First, there is the typical macro
programming for running certain tasks automatically. Secondly, parts of OpenOffice.org
can be run as components of other programs; e.g., OpenOffice.org components are
accessible as JavaBeans components.
<p>
A more advanced application is to modify OpenOffice.org components by wrapping them
into replacement components or integrating completely new components with
OpenOffice.org.
<p>
A very interesting application area is to replace the user interface of OpenOffice.org and
build a completely different application domain.
<p>
<a NAME="20"></a><font SIZE="4">Design Principles</font>
<p>
Some principles that are important in all our designs are:
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">orthogonality</font><br>
The API consists of interfaces which can easily be combined to serve special needs of
certain objects.
<li><font SIZE="4">scalability</font><br>
We distinguish between functionality that is commonly needed and that which is
required by specialized versions. Developers can always start with a minimum set of
interfaces and add more step by step to embody more features.
<li><font SIZE="4">reusability</font><br>
We avoid creating specialized interfaces when a generic version is possible.
<li><font SIZE="4">Remote usability</font><br>
Services can be used efficiently from different processes or even different machines.
<li><font SIZE="4">multithread enabled</font><br>
Services can be used from multiple 
  threads.</li>
      
</ul>
<a NAME="21"></a><font SIZE="4">Architectural Paradigm</font>
<p>
Our architectural decision is Interfaces and Support-Classes instead of Implementation
Inheritance.
<p>
Interfaces and Support-Classes means that objects communicate only by interfaces.
Support classes are used for recurring implementations. This was the choice for our
design because components are highly independent of environment, language and version
Implementation Inheritance means partly implemented base classes from which
specialized classes derive interface and implementation. This paradigm was not our
choice, because in larger systems this leads to fat interfaces or deep inheritance hierarchy.
In addition, components depend on the environment, mostly via their base class, and are
programming language dependent and highly version dependent.
<p>
<a NAME="22"></a><font SIZE="4">Object Model</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org API is designed for and implemented using the OpenOffice.org
Component Technology. Therefore the OpenOffice.org API is programming language
independent and can be used from C/C++, Java, and several scripting languages. For
other languages, only a language binding needs to be provided to access the whole
OpenOffice.org API. The API is made up by following stereotypes:
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">implementation classes</font><br>
These are not actually part of the API, but are mentioned here for better
understanding. Implementation classes are implementations of services using a real
programming language. Normally developers who use services do not have to deal
with the implementation itself on the API level. Objects are usually not translated into
language concepts for an application that uses them, but rather for the implementer of
the class. A good example is an implementation class similar to a concrete Java-class.
<li><font SIZE="4">services</font><br>
Specifications of objects are called services. One can think of a service as a contract
which is beneficial to both sides: the implementation class that supports certain
services and the application that uses this component for those services. Services
usually describe the interfaces which they implement and a set of their properties.
Although services are normally not translated into language concepts, a service may
be considered to be similar to an abstract Java class.
<li><font SIZE="4">interfaces</font><br>
Specifications of a single aspect on an API level are called interfaces. A service can be
considered to be a legally proven text module for contracts. Services can be combined
to create contracts. Interfaces are very much like Java technology interfaces.
<li><font SIZE="4">structs</font><br>
Plain data blocks are specified as structs . Structs, therefore, do not have methods. The
advantage of structs is that they can transferred as they are to a different process or
even a different machine, which increases efficiency of interprocess and remote calls.
With Java technology, structs are represented as a class which consist only of data
members and get and set methods.
<li><font SIZE="4">exceptions</font><br>
Exceptions are extraordinary results from method calls. Exceptions are used for error
handling just as in the Java technology.
<li><font SIZE="4">constants/constant groups/enums</font><br>
Constant values are split into two 
  categories: constants - which can be grouped and can have numeric or character 
  string values, and enums - which contain a fixed set of numeric values. In the 
  Java technology, both are represented as classes with constant data members.</li>
             
               
            
 
</ul>
<p>
<a NAME="23"></a><font SIZE="4">Common Design Patterns</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org API uses heavily designed patterns, which provide a very consistent
overall design. Some examples of application domain unspecific design patterns are:
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">Factory environment/container</font><br>
New instances of services are created using factories. Factories of contents can
emanate from the container object or from the environment. For efficiency, factories
for iterators of all kinds, including cursors, are provided by the container.
<li><font SIZE="4">Property Sets/-Access etc.</font><br>
A set of interfaces makes the properties specified in the services accessible. Properties
can be viewed as non-structural data members of objects, such as color or font. The
variety of access interfaces covers the spectrum from convenient local access to fast
remote access.
<li><font SIZE="4">Collections/Containers</font><br>
A collection in our terminology gives access to a set of similar sub-objects. A
container allows replacement, insertion and removal of these sub-objects. A wide
variety of predefined interfaces is available for this design pattern.
<li><font SIZE="4">Enumerators/Iterators/Cursors</font><br>
Enumerators, iterators and cursors are used for efficiently listing contained objects.
Cursors in text play an especially major role, because indexing of text is not
reasonable.
<li><font SIZE="4">X...Supplier</font><br>
To access structural but optional data members, we frequently offer supplier interfaces
which in many cases only have one get method.
<li><font SIZE="4">Events</font><br>
Where it is of interest to get notification about certain status changes, there are
services that offer methods to register and unregister listener interfaces. When the
event occurs, a method at the listener interface is called and the event is given as an
argument. This is the same as in the event concept in JavaBeans.
<li><font SIZE="4">Exceptions for Error Handling</font><br>
Exceptions constitute our 
  principal error handling concept. For asynchronous calls, exceptions are 
  transferred in callback events.</li>
         
     
</ul>
<a NAME="24"></a><font SIZE="4">Module Categories</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org API is organized in a hierarchical module concept which follows
Java technology package or CORBA conventions.
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">office specific interfaces</font><br>
e.g. For text documents, spreadsheet documents, drawing and presentation documents
<li><font SIZE="4">integration framework</font><br>
These interfaces make it possible to integrate new components into OpenOffice.org,
e.g.: configuration management , Universal Content Broker
<li><font SIZE="4">application domain independent</font><br>
This very important category contains interfaces for property access, collections and
contains, or streaming operations, as well as for attaching scripting engines and many
more interfaces.
<li><font SIZE="4">component system</font><br>
The base of the suite is the handful of 
  interfaces which are necessary to deal with object model topics such as 
  lifetime control, querying interfaces, building bridges and instantiating 
  remote objects.</li>
               
           
  
</ul>
<a NAME="25"></a><font SIZE="4">Summary</font>
<p>
The results and benefits of the OpenOffice.org source projects principles and activities to
date are manyfold. One can build new applications from components without modifying
source code. One can use a familiar programming language. The entire API is
documented in a reference manual ¯ http://soldc.sun.com/staroffice. A
first release of a Development Kit, containing support of the OpenOffice.org Basic and
also Java technology, is available.
<p>
<a NAME="26"></a><font SIZE="5">CHAPTER 5</font>
<br>
<font SIZE="5">Architecture</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org source project is based on an architecture that can provide
comprehensive personal productivity to different UNIX-based systems and may be ported
many other platforms as well. This is because the whole technology is based on a
platform-independent approach. Less than 10% of the code is platform dependent. This
acts as an abstraction layer for the upper software components. Because of the availability
of C++-Compilers on every major platform, C++ is used as an implementation language.
This allows to port the OpenOffice.org technology to a wide range of different platforms.
The decision for an object oriented language gives the OpenOffice.org source project the
opportunity deliver a fully object oriented architecture.
<p>
The following information will give just a rough overview over the overall architecture.
Some components of the OpenOffice.org source project like the help-system or the setup
application are not covered here. Many parts of the OpenOffice.org source project
consists of more than one CVS module. In many cases one block in the architecture is
covered by more than five CVS modules in the source tree.
<p>
<a NAME="27"></a><font SIZE="5">Layered architecture</font>
<p>
The whole architecture is based on a layered approach. There are four defined layers
where each covers a special area of the functionality.
<ul>
<li><font SIZE="4">System Abstraction Layer</font><br>
This layer encapsulates all system specific APIs and provide a consistent object
oriented API to access system resources in a platform independent manner.
<li><font SIZE="4">Infrastructure Layer</font><br>
A platform independent environment for building application, components and services
is provided by this layer. It covers many aspects of an object oriented API for a
complete object oriented platform including a component model, scripting, compound
documents, etc.
<li><font SIZE="4">Framework Layer</font><br>
To allow the reuse of implementations in different applications the layer provides the
framework or environment for each application and all shared functionality like
common dialogs, file access or the configuration management
<li><font SIZE="4">Application Layer</font><br>
All OpenOffice.org applications are part 
  of this layer. The way these applications interact is based on the lower 
  layers The chart shown below was created to depict the architecture of the 
  StarOffice suite but it is the same for the OpenOffice.org suite:</li>
           
               
             
</ul>
<p>
<img alt="" border=0 height=330 src="staroffice_layers.gif" width=485>
<p>
<a NAME="28"></a><font SIZE="4">System abstraction layer</font>
<p>
The layered approach of the system architecture is one of the important facts to allow the
easy porting of the technology to wide range of different system platforms. For this the
architecture defines a virtual layer witch is called the System Abstraction Layer (SAL).
All platform depended implementation take place below this layer or are part of some
optional modules. In an ideal world an implementation of the SAL specific functionality
and recompiling the upper layer module will allow you to run the applications. To provide
the whole set of functionality the optional platform specific modules, like telephony
support or speech recognition, have to be ported, too. To reduce the porting effort the set
of functionality provide by the SAL is reduced to a minima set available on every
platform. Also for some system the layer includes some implementations to emulate some
functionality or behavior. For example on systems where no native multi threading is
supported, the layer can support so called “user land” threads.
<p>
At this time the implementation of the platform dependent and independent parts of the
graphical library is linked into one dynamically loaded shared library. So there is no well
defined set of libraries which build up the SAL.
<p>
<a NAME="29"></a><font SIZE="4">Operating system layer</font>
<p>
The operating system layer (OSL) encapsulates all the operating system specific
functionality for using and accessing system specific resources like files, memory,
sockets, pipes, etc. The OSL is a very thin layer with an object oriented API. In contrast to
the upper layer this object oriented API is a C-API. This will allow to easily port this
layer to different platforms using different implementation languages. For embedded
systems or internet appliances for examples an assembler language can be used to realize
the implementation.
<p>
<a NAME="30"></a><font SIZE="4">Runtime library</font>
<p>
The runtime library provides all semi platform independent functionality. There is an
implementation for string classes provided. Routines for conversion of strings to different
character sets are implemented. The memory management functionality resides in this
module.
<p>
<a NAME="31"></a><font SIZE="4">Standard Template library</font>
<p>
As a generic container library the standard template library is used. It supplies
implementations for list, queues, stacks, maps, etc.
<p>
<a NAME="32"></a><font SIZE="4">Visual Class library</font>
<p>
The visual class library is one of the core libraries of the OpenOffice.org technology. The
VCL encapsulate all access to the different underlying GUI systems. The implementation
is separated into two major parts. One is completely platform independent and includes an
object oriented 2D graphics API with metafiles, fonts, raster operations and the whole
widget set use by the OpenOffice.org suite. This approach virtually guarantees that all
widgets have the same behavior independently of the used GUI system on the different
platforms. Also the look &amp; feel and the functionality of the widgets are on all platforms the
same.
<p>
Because of this design VCL doesn't encapsulate the native widgets or controls of the
underlying GUI system. The platform dependent part implements a 2D-graphic drawing
canvas which is used by the platform independent parts. This canvas redirect every
functionality directly to the underlying GUI system. Currently there exists implementation
for the Win32, X-Windows, OS/2 and Mac. The access to the printing functionality,
clipboard and Drag &amp; Drop is also realized inside the VCL.
<p>
<a NAME="33"></a><font SIZE="5">Infrastructure layer</font>
<p>
<a NAME="34"></a><font SIZE="4">Virtual Operating System layer</font>
<p>
To make the usage of system resources like files, threads, sockets,etc. more convenient
the virtual operating system layer encapsulates all the functionality of the operating system layer
into C++ classes. The C++ classes here offer an easy to use access to all system resources
in an object oriented way.
<p>
<a NAME="35"></a><font SIZE="4">Tools libraries</font>
<p>
There are different small libraries building up a set of tool functionality. This includes a
common implementation for handling date and time related data. There is in
implementation for structured storages available. Other implementation provide a generic
registry, typesafe management and persistence of property data.
<p>
<a NAME="36"></a><font SIZE="4">Universal Network Objects</font>
<p>
The so called Universal Network Objects are the component technology used inside the
OpenOffice.org products. The component technology does not depend on any graphical
subsystem, but is heavily based on multithreading and network communication
capabilities.
<p>
The system consists of several pieces. An IDL-Compiler, which generates out of the
specified definition of an interface a binary representation and the associated C-Header or
Java technology files. The binary representation is platform and language independent
and is at runtime used to marshall argument for remote function calls or to generate code
on the fly for a specific language to access the implementation provided by the interface.
This technique reduced the amount of generated code for the different language binding
tremendously. The drawback is that not only for every language binding a specific
backend for the code generation is needed, it is that for every specific compiler a bridging
module is needed at runtime.
<p>
Many parts of the UNO technology are implemented as UNO components. This helps to
create a very flexible system and also the extension of the system at runtime. For example
by providing new bridges or communication protocols. UNO provides transparent access
to components over the network or locally. For the communication over the network IIOP
can be used. If the component are realized as shared libraries the component can be
loaded by UNO into to the process memory of the application and every access of the
component is just like a function call without any marshalling of arguments which is
required for remote function call.
<p>
<a NAME="37"></a><font SIZE="4">Universal Content Broker</font>
<p>
The Universal Content Broker allows all upper layers to access different kind of structure
content transparently. The UCB consists of a core and several Universal Content
Providers which are used to integrate different access protocols. The current
implementations provides content providers for the HTTP protocol, FTP protocol,
WebDAV protocol and access to the local file system.
<p>
The UCB does not only provide access to the content, it also provides the associated meta
information to the content. Actually there is synchronous and asynchronous mode for
operations supported.
<p>
<a NAME="38"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org Compound Objects</font>
<p>
The Compound Object implementation provide the functionality to build compound
documents, where for example a spreadsheet is being embedded in a word-processor
document.
<p>
The current implementation provides a platform independent implementation of all this
functionality for compound documents and for embedding of visual controls like multi
media players or different kind of viewers. All content of compound document is stored in
a structured storage. The current implementation is compatible to the OLE structure
storage format. This allows access to OLE compound documents on every platform where
OpenOffice.org is available. On the Windows platform the implementation interact with
the OLE services and will so allow a tight integration of all OLE capable applications.
<p>
<a NAME="39"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org Scripting and Basic library</font>
<p>
The scripting functionality coming with the OpenOffice.org suite is a BASIC dialect
featuring an interpreter that parses the source statements and generates meta instructions.
These instructions can be executed directly by the supplied meta instructions processor or
can be made persistent in modules or libraries for later access. All functionality supplied
by the upper level application components is accessible via a scripting interface in the
component technology. This will help to ensure that new components using the
OpenOffice.org component technology can be fully scriptable without spending a huge
amount of effort.
<p>
The scripting interfaces are also implemented as components which will allow an easy
integration of other scripting languages. The interfaces provide functionality like core
reflection and introspection similar to the functionality by the Java platform.
<p>
<a NAME="40"></a><font SIZE="5">Framework layer</font>
<p>
<a NAME="41"></a><font SIZE="4">OpenOffice.org Application framework library</font>
<p>
The Application framework library provides an environment for all applications. All
functionality shared by all application and not provided by any other layer is realized
here. For the framework every visual application has to provide a shell and can provide
several views. The library provides all basic functionality so only the application specific
features have to be added.
<p>
The Framework is also responsible for content detection and aggregation. The template
management is provided here and the configuration management too. The Framework is
in some areas related to the compound documents, because of the functionality for
merging or switching menu- and toolbars. Also the capability for customization of all
applications is provided by the library.
<p>
<a NAME="42"></a><font SIZE="4">SVX Library</font>
<p>
The SVX library provides shared functionality for all applications which is not related to
a framework. So part of the library is a complete object oriented drawing layer which is
used by several applications for graphic editing and output. Also a complete 3D-rendering
systems is part of the drawing functionality.
<p>
The common dialogs for font selection, color chooser, etc. are all part of this library. Also
the whole database connectivity is realized here.
<p>
<a NAME="43"></a><font SIZE="5">Application layer</font>
<p>
All applications like the wordprocessor application, spreadsheet application, presentation
application, charting application, etc. build up this layer. All these applications are realized
as shared libraries, which are loaded by the application framework at runtime. The
framework provides the environment for all these applications and also provides the
functionality for how these applications can interact.
<p>
<a NAME="44"></a><font SIZE="5">CHAPTER 6</font>
<br>
<font SIZE="5">Build Environment</font>
<p>
The following information provides an overview of the proposed Build Experience for
OpenOffice.org and how we hope it will evolve. This information is intended for
developers and engineering managers.
<p>
<a NAME="45"></a><font SIZE="5">Open Source projects</font>
<p>
Open Source projects follow by now a very familiar pattern when it comes to providing a
Build Experience. This translates as follows:
<ol>
<li>cvs checkout OpenOffice
<li>./configure
<li>make
<li>make install</li> 
</ol>
The build tools are well known to the Open Source community - i.e., gmake, autconf, etc.
This is the Build Experience that we want OpenOffice.org source project developers to
work within. Not only should this be the sum total of the commands involved, but more
importantly milestone builds should build cleanly on all supported platforms.
The OpenOffice.org technology in its first release under the OpenOffice.org source
project will not support the mode described above. The mode initially supported will not
be far from this model, and it will contain the foundation for evolving to this model. The
only implication is that build tools may not be the ones most familiar to the open source
community. Sun is committed to providing a product that builds. This document will
describe this Build Experience.
<p>
It is important to understand that the Build Experience will be an evolving model, one
that will grow and gain from the experience of the Open Source Developer Community.
<p>
The task facing us is a challenging one. The OpenOffice.org suite is a very large
application from any standpoint. It is a complex application consisting mainly of C++
code employing templates and exception handling and supporting independent language
binding for a distributed component based architecture.
<p>
<a NAME="46"></a><font SIZE="5">The Build Experience</font>
<p>
The Build Experience will cover the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Build Requirements
<li>Downloading the Source
<li>Build Prerequisites
<li>Build and Install Instructions
<li>Build Tools &amp; Makefiles
<li>Build Environment
<li>Build Troubleshooting
<li>Porting to New Platforms
<li>Build Documentation and Infrastructure</li>   
</ul>
<p>
<a NAME="47"></a><font SIZE="4">Build Requirements</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org sources will build on the Solaris(TM) operating environment, Linux,
and WIN32 platform. Work is in progress on the Macintosh platform. Each system will
describe the software and hardware requirements to build on their respective systems.
Typical of these will the version of gcc, the Java Technology JDK , hard disk and RAM
sizes.
<p>
It is crucial that these requirements be understood at the outset. Building the
OpenOffice.org sources is not a task to be taken lightly. It may turn out to be the largest
open source project ever in terms of source size and time to build. The source and build
environment size is in the region of 500MB and consists of approximately 40,000 files. It
can take up to 18 hours to fully build from scratch, but this is rarely needed. The build
environment is prepared to allow working with milestone builds.
<p>
<a NAME="48"></a><font SIZE="4">Downloading the Source</font>
<p>
The source may be downloaded using CVS, or ftp can be employed to download gzipped
tarballs of the source. In addition, milestone completed builds will be made available in
gzipped tarball format plus daily snapshots of the source.
<p>
<a NAME="49"></a><font SIZE="4">Build Prerequisites</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org technology relies on a number of external sources to be built.
Instructions on where to locate and download these will be available.
<p>
<a NAME="50"></a><font SIZE="4">Build and Install Instructions</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org technology will use autoconf to check the integrity of the build
environment and to set up the correct build environment on the supported platforms.
<p>
After setting up the build environment, the build and install instructions will support the
make and make install concepts. Details on building all the source as well as build
components will be available.
<p>
<a NAME="51"></a><font SIZE="4">Build Tools &amp; Makefiles</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org technology is built using dmake from the http://dmake.wticorp.com .
This is itself an open sourced project. The syntax is a make like syntax. The dmake
options will support a dmake all, dmake &lt;component&gt; and dmake install concepts.
<p>
The OpenOffice.org source project team has also developed a number of development
tools including support for Interface Definition Language formats, resource pre-processors
and bitmap creators. All these will be fully explained.
<p>
<a NAME="52"></a><font SIZE="4">Build Environment</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org technology relies on a large set of environment variables as well as
compiler pre-processor options and flags. These will be documented to support greater
understanding of the build environment among developers.
<p>
The OpenOffice.org technology is a CVS module based source tree. These CVS modules
will have an overview explanation plus an explanation of the order in which they are built.
<p>
<a NAME="53"></a><font SIZE="4">Build Troubleshooting</font>
<p>
A troubleshooting guide and Build FAQ will be published to support developers.
<p>
<a NAME="54"></a><font SIZE="4">Porting to Other Systems</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org technology for its supported platforms will rely on a bootstrap
process that is in place in order to build it. To port the OpenOffice.org technology,
developers will need to know how to create this bootstrap in the first place.
<p>
<a NAME="55"></a><font SIZE="4">Build Documentation &amp; Infrastructure</font>
<p>
An online Build manual will exist to cover all the topics described above. There will also
be a support infrastructure in place to deal with specific build issues. Bugzilla will be
employed to store all bugs and issues arising from the build.
<p>
<a NAME="56"></a><font SIZE="5">Outlook</font>
<p>
Providing a clean Build Experience which is familiar and consistent to the Open Source
Community is not only our aim but we see it as critical to the success of this project.
Although this experience has not yet reached full fruition, Sun has determined not to
delay the release of the source for this reason. It is more important that we engage with
the community than to wait until we have replicated the same build experience. To this
end we are committed to providing as clean a build as possible now while putting an
infrastructure in place to allow us to evolve to a more standard model.
<p>
<a NAME="57"></a><font SIZE="5">Current Source Tree</font>
<p>
The OpenOffice.org source project will be among the largest open source projects. There
are about 70 CVS modules with more than 35,000 files providing about 5,000,000 lines
of code.
<p>
Appendix A gives a first overview over all CVS modules with a short description of the
purpose. Additional information will be made available at the website
/ .
<p>
<a NAME="58"></a><font SIZE="5">CHAPTER 7</font>
<br>
<font SIZE="5">Future Steps</font>
<p>
<a NAME="59"></a><font SIZE="5">An Open World Component Technology</font>
<p>
<a NAME="60"></a><font SIZE="4">Current Situation</font>
<p>
Nowadays there is no Component Technology in the Open world which is accepted by
everyone. There exist different open source projects which are based on a component
model, but each of them uses its own concept or technology.
<p>
KDE and GNOME are in the Desktop domain. Both of them are using CORBA as a
low-level communication layer but the component models on top are completely different
in each project. So today it is essentially impossible to write a component which can be
used in both desktop environments. Also the current CORBA specification doesn't
include a model for compound documents or other desktop software related functionality. 
So there are different efforts underway to overcome these problems, but they lack
interoperability. Another issue with most CORBA implementations is that these were
designed to run distributed network based applications using remote services. So using
such CORBA implementation with all the network communication overhead in an
infrastructure for a desktop component model, which in most cases will run on one local
machine, will be in most cases the wrong approach.
<p>
When the Mozilla open source project started, there was a requirement to have a
lightweight component model which could be easily ported to different platforms. So
XPCOM was created.
<p>
The reasons why the OpenOffice.org suite currently employs its own component model
are all based on these issues. Additionally, there is the requirement to provide a similar set
of office suite functionality and technology to the widely used Microsoft products in this
domain.
<p>
<a NAME="61"></a><font SIZE="4">A Short Term Solution</font>
<p>
As discussed above, there is no component technology available which is well accepted,
portable and used prevalently. So to provide office functionality in different
environments, it is necessary that different component technologies be supported.
Supporting different component technologies is difficult but possible, but supporting
different concepts or philosophies is quite impossible.
<p>
Because OpenOffice.org's component technology is able to use software bridges to access
other components' worlds, it is possible to integrate the office components into different
environments, such as GNOME and Mozilla. The bridging can be easily done in an
environment where the basic concept for the components are quite similar. In any other
case in can be very hard to provide this bridging functionality hiding all conceptual
differences. In most cases developers and users will have to deal with the different
concepts and philosophies. One of the annoying problems for example will be the
different naming convention. Also if a bridge needs to deal with a complex conversion of
arguments and calling conventions, performance issues could arise.
<p>
So in the near future we will provide bridges from OpenOffice.org component technology
to XPCOM and Bonobo. OpenOffice.org components can than be used in these
environment as integrated components.
<p>
<a NAME="62"></a><font SIZE="4">Vision</font>
<p>
The past has shown the importance of a homogenous component technology and an
object model which integrates all software components into one easy-to-use building set.
The use of existing building blocks in different development environments like C/C++,
Java technology, Pyton, Perl, VB, etc. should be transparently provided by a
component technology.
<p>
The object model should define the reuse of existing interfaces and components and the
matching of concepts over a wide array of applications. It should define common base
concepts that will be used no matter what component is being reused or what application
is being built.
<p>
One challenge for the Open World will be to provide one efficient component technology
and a homogenous, superior object model for the desktop, the office productivity suite,
and the browser.
<p>
<a NAME="63"></a><font SIZE="4">Unified Component Ware</font>
<p>
A unified Component Technology should meet what is required for today's
solutions. 
This will not guarantee that the technology will fulfill all future
requirements, but it will allow the replacement of the existing solutions over time and it
will increase acceptance by the Open World. To ensure a high level of acceptance, open
standards should be used whenever appropriate.
<p>
CORBA is an open standard that is widely accepted for building heterogeneous
distributed systems. On the other hand the CORBA specification falls short in the areas of
compound documents and small components for personal productivity. This has changed
to some extent with the CORBA 3.0 specification, but there are still open issues. For a
desktop environment there is a need for support of in-process components and for local
communication features, which are today still open to implementation in the CORBA
environment. To the extent that these features are transparent to all components, there is
no need for a clear specification, but in most cases today the developer of the component
and the developer of the application using these components has to deal with this
situation. Another problem for an open component system is the lack of a technology and
a concept for writing cross-platform graphical components.
<p>
ORBit is the CORBA implementation used by most of the GNOME components. It is fast
and lean, allowing the use of CORBA in areas that would not normally seem practical. It
supports much of the CORBA 2.2 standard, and has hooks that allow easy integration
with GNOME programs. ORBit provides language binding for Perl, C++, Tcl, Python,
ADA and Eiffel, but currently not for Java technology. It allows C and C++ objects in the
same address space to short-circuit calls (i.e. no on-the-wire marshaling) for maximum
speed. The ORBit is a good candidate starting point for an open component technology.
It could provide the functionality for all communication infrastructure and will allow
interoperability with CORBA. While CORBA is an accepted standard, the ice Component
Model provides the ability to bridge easily from one component environment to another,
which will for example allow the usage of components in the Microsoft world. Also, the
Mozilla XPCOM technology is a very lightweight and lean system that it could provide
some advantages for an overall system.
<p>
On top of this communication and low level object infrastructure there should be a clear
definition of interfaces for commonly used functionality, such as factories and reference-counted
objects. There is also a requirement for a clear concept for lifetime management
of components, activation, security and the integration into a graphical subsystems. All
these interfaces should be designed for use in many different application domains.
Especially for personal productivity tools and desktop environments, we need a clear
concept and definition of interfaces to build up an infrastructure for:
<ul>
<li>Compound Documents and Component Reuse
<li>Document Models
<li>Content Storage
<li>Monikers
<li>Control Components
<li>Component activation (Shared library components, process-based components and
distributed components)
<li>Printing</li>
</ul>
It is important that these specifications be useful in many application domains, and that
standards that cover existing areas be used and supported.
<p>
Not every developer wants to deal with all the details of a component model. Therefore,
to achieve acceptance, it is important to provide helper libraries for different languages
that make the usage and the implementation of components as easy as possible.
<p>
<a NAME="64"></a><font SIZE="4">Outlook</font>
<p>
We have started an initiative for a new homogenous component technology by talking to
several developers in different open source projects. We will work together with different
groups to provide a leading edge component technology for a desktop environment and
distributed applications. To the extent that standards are available and meet the
requirements, they will be used. We would like to see the best pieces of today's existing
technologies (e.g. Bonobo, XPCOM, UNO ...) be integrated into this technology.
<p>
Also we would like to start an effort with several open source projects to define the
concept, the naming conventions and philosophy for an Open World component mode. By
the time the component model is available it will be used by all OpenOffice.org
components, and the OpenOffice.org API will be adapted over time to meet the
specification of the new component model. In the future this will allow writing highly
sophisticated applications and solutions by using existing components exclusively.

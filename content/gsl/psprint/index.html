<H1>PSPrint - a Unix print solution</H1>
<P STYLE="page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>History</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P>StarOffice 5.2 (and earlier) relied on a thirdparty solution for
printing. This solution could of course not be open sourced as it was
a commercial product. So when StarOffice became OpenOffice there was
no printing possible at all on the Unix platforms; just a wrapper was
provided that contained stubs fitting the missing symbols left in
vcl. A new print solution was desperately needed, so a variety of
existing print solutions were examined, the most notable of which
were gnome-print and Xprint. Gnome-print did not really fit into
OpenOffice.org, since it would require to link against a huge amount
of other gnome libraries, too, which is unacceptable for
OpenOffice.org, because we want to run on many desktops. Xprint was
designed as a standard Unix print solution and has many advantages:
code for the display would work exactly the same way on the printer.
A proof of concept version was created by Martin Maher and Oisin
Boydell with help from Hamburg and the US which made it into
OpenOffice.org as a temporary solution to have minimal print support
on Unix. But Xprint in its current state misses many features that
become increasingly important: fast character metric handling, access
to glyph substitution tables, easy configurability on a per user
basis just to name a few. Also one cannot really say that it has
become the standard solution for printing on Unix yet; in fact only
recently it was awakened from its long beauty sleep having its major
bugs fixed so it is now useable.</P>
<P>This led to the decision that as long as there is no standard
solution scratching a sufficient number of our itches OpenOffice.org
should do like everyone else and produce its own PostScript code.
Hence psprint entered the game.</P>

<P>PSPrint consists of the following major parts:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Font management: done by the <CODE>PrintFontManager</CODE>
	class. This class handles font discovery as well as font information
	like metrics and font properties.</P>
	<LI><P>Printer management: done by the <CODE>PrinterInfoManager</CODE>
	class. This class handles printer discovery and information. It can
	store and load properties of a printer, most important the default
	job setup (which contains information like paper size, orientation,
	etc.). To know about a printers capabilities you need PPD
	(PostScript Printer Description) files which can be parsed with the
	<CODE>PPDParser</CODE> class.</P>
	<LI><P>Graphic operations: done by the <CODE>PrinterGfx</CODE>
	class. This is really the work horse of PSPrint. It handles all
	kinds of text output, drawing operations, bitmaps and the like.</P>
	<LI><P>Font subsetting: provided by <A HREF="mailto://alexander.gelfenbain@Sun.COM">Alexander
	Gelfenbain</A>. This enables PSPrint to make use of TrueType fonts
	and collections in a very effective way by sending just the glyphs
	that are needed down to the printer.</P>
	<LI><P>Job management: done by the <CODE>PrinterJob</CODE> class.
	This class ties the PostScript code produced by PrinterGfx together
	downloading the necessary fonts as well as providing a framework for
	the raw PostScript code.</P>

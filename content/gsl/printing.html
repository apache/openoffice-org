<H3>Printing on Windows</H3>
<P>Printing on Windows is done via the native GDI API. Nothing much
to say about that.</P>
<H3>Printing on Unix</H3>
<P>The current (632 and above) VCL (Visual Class) library (see GSL
project) supports two solutions for printing:</P>

	<LI><P><A HREF="psprint/index.html">psprint</A></P>
	<LI><P><A HREF="http://printing.openoffice.org/xprint.html">Xprint</A></P>
</UL>
<P><A HREF="psprint/index.html">PSPrint</A> is a new PostScript
generator integrated into the vcl printing mechanism. It was designed
after the vcl sal API and therefore integrates seamlessly. Currently
PSPrint is the default option used by vcl. To us Xprint change the
makefile.pmk in vcl/util and comment out the <CODE>BUILTIN_RASTERIZER</CODE>
as well as the <CODE>USE_PSPRINT</CODE> definitions.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://printing.openoffice.org/xprint.html">XPrint</A> as
another option for printing on Linux/Unix. Martin Maher and Oisin
Boydell along with colleagues in Hamburg and the US have added the
capability to print with OpenOffice.org under Unix using XPrint
originally as a short term solution. This was the quickest way we
could get some form of printing into OpenOffice.org and is a complete
different printing environment than in the StarOffice 5.2 version.
See <A HREF="http://printing.openoffice.org/xprint.html">OpenOffice.org
and Xprint</A> and <CODE><A HREF="http://printing.openoffice.org/xprt.sh">xprt.sh</A></CODE>
from Oisin. 
</P>
<P>In the future we hope to adopt a system wide printing solution
like on other systems. <BR><BR><BR>

oneway call deadlocks using a remote bridge shown at a clipboard API
scenario</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Normally a deadlock can only occur in
conjunction with at least two threads acquiring at least two
synchronisation objects concurrently.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But using oneway methods of UNO
interfaces through a remote bridge can cause a deadlock even if only
one thread is running and only one synchronisation object is used.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">One key feature of UNO is that it
preserves the order of method calls of any kind (synchronous, oneway)
over every bridge. Using an inprocess bridge to an interface this is
quite easy because the order is preserved by the callstack of the
current thread. Actually a oneway call is synchronous to.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But using an interface through a remote
bridge changes the situation. When calling a oneway method the remote
bridge accepts the call of the caller and returns immediatly. The
call is delivered to the remote end of the bridge and executed. If
the caller now calls further oneway methods on that interface in the
same thrwead context the calls are delivered to the remote end of the
bridge and the caller thread continues execution. But on the remote
side of the bridge the the call is scheduled until all previous
oneway calls are executed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the caller now calls a synchronous
method on the interface not only the cally thread on the remote side
of the bridge has to wait until all previous oneway calls are
finished but also the caller blocks until all previous oneway calls
of the thread are finished.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This behaviour ensures the call order
when using a remote bridge.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But there is a caveat. The remote
bridge implies an additonal synchronisation object and an additional
thread on cally side that can cause a deadlock scenario that is not
even evident.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Let me explain the problem by an
scenario using the clipboard API. The interface
<A HREF="http://com.sun.star.datatransfer.XClipboard/">com.sun.star.datatransfer.XClipboard</A>
has a method setContens to put some content into the clipboard. This
method is declared oneway because the client must not wait until the
clipboard has finished. The method getContents on the other hand is
synchronous because it needs the clipboard content to return.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Assume one thread on caller side calls
XClipboard::setContents. The caller thread continues executing while
the call is delivered to the remote interface. Now the caller wants
to ensure that the data has arrived in the clipboard, locks the
formerly know SolarMutex and calls XClipboard::getContents. The call
blocks on caller side because the cally still executes the
setContents call and as you remember UNO wants to preserve the call
order.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now the cally &#150; the clipboard
implementation on remote side &#150; puts the new data into the
clipboard and wants to inform the previous clipboard owner that he's
not longer the owner of the clipboard. It calls back to the cally
side through a XClipboardOwner interface. This call is not executed
in the origin thread on cally side because the thread has continued
execution after the oneway call. Therefore UNO executes the callback
in a new thread. Now the clipboard owner recognizes that content
change of the clipboard and wants to update his state and tries to
lock the SolarMutex. Unfortunately the SolarMutex is already locked
and owned by the origin thread. The result is that the callback waits
for the SolarMutex and blocks the termination of the oneway call and
the synchronous getContents call block too becuase he waits for the
termination of the oneway call.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This situation is a deadlock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">How to prevent from this situation ?
Well, actually the implementation of clipboard services do not rely
on the call order of the oneway calls of setContens. Each oneway call
received is marshalled into one dispatcher thread and the oneway call
returns immediatly. This prevents from the situation that subsequent
synchronous calls have to wait for the completion of the oneway
calls.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are two issues to care about:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you are implementing a oneway method
of an UNO interface try to return immedialty and deliver execution in
an extra thread if you use other interfaces to call back inside the
implementation of the oneway method. This is what the clipboard does.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you are using a oneway method and
the call order is not relevant, do call oneway methods in the same
thread you are using to call synchronous methods but rather do the
oneway calls in an extra thread. This is quite neccessary if you know
of the implementation of the interface that it does callbacks through
other interfaces during execution of oneway methods.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you are not aware what the
implementation does or even worse you have to rely on call order make
sure you don't own any mutex or other synchronisation object that
maybe accessed in a callback during a oneway method execution.</P>

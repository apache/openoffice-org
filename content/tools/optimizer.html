<P>Optimizer.pl &#150; tool for eliminating redundant exported
symbols.</P>
<P>Make new optimized .def-file (first step) or make lists of unused
export symbols (as second step).</P>
<P>Synopsis:</P>
<P>perl optimizer.pl [-pro] -c|a</P>
<P>Description</P>
<P>-a 
</P>
<P>Analyse the stand. This should be used as a first step. New,
optimized .def files are produced on this step.</P>
<P>It is recommended when finished this first step to build the
libraries with modified wnt.mk. If you remove /OPT:NOREF option for
linker in this file, you'll get fully optimized version of libraries
(there's no guarantee that it will be working version). You get also
correspondent .map file. It seems to worth efforts to analyse stand
again and rebuild libraries, since now some unused imported symbols
might be thrown away.</P>
<P>-c</P>
<P>Compare the lists. This should be used as a first step. On this
step new .map files and old .map-files are compared and file with
obsolete symbols is stored in the same directory as .obs, where these
two are.</P>
<P>How it works:</P>
<P>This tool is a Perl script, its functionality is implemented on
analysis of .def and .map files produced by MS linker cl.exe. It must
be started from the main directory of the stand whith corresponding
options.</P>
<P>The tool parses symbols imported from another libraries in
correspondent .map files and makes a complete t imported symbols
table (IST) in memory. When all .map files are parsed and complete
IST is made, .def file for each library is analysed and if there are
symbols which are not found in IST, than they are thrown away in new
.def file. Former .def file is backed up as .olddef if there were no
.olddef file before. You get the entire list of the libraries and
projects to be rebuilt if any new .def files were made. There are
some symbols which are exported a priori (a priori export symbols
(APE), they are:</P>
<P>component_getDescriptionFunc</P>
<P>component_getImplementationEnvironment</P>
<P>component_getFactory</P>
<P>component_writeInfo</P>
<P>This table can be enlaged when needed. This tool enables to reduce
libraries' size, but there is no warranty, that optimized library
would be working correctly. This may occur when there are symbols
that must not be thrown away, but they are not imported by any
library explicitely. Such symbols should be taken into account when
optimizing, that is taken into APE. This tool was developed with
intention to reduce export tables of libraries and to produce list of
probably unused symbols.</P>

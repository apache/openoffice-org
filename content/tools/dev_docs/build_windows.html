<h2>
<a NAME="Overview">Overview</a>
</h2>

<p>
This section is meant as a reminder or checklist for those who have some 
experience in building OpenOffice.org. Everybody else should jump to the 
<a href="#BuildRequirements">Build Requirements</a> section. 

<p> 
Even experienced builders are well advised to check the release notes at 
<a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.0.0rc2.html">
http://development.openoffice.org/releases/2.0.0rc2.html</a>
and the section <a href="#BuildRequirements">Build Requirements</a> in this 
document to inform yourself about changes since the previous releases. 

<p>
Detailed step-by-step build descriptions are given from the next section on. 

<!-- Not available for OOo 1.9.x
<p>
You can perform a full build, or you can build an individual project using 
a prebuilt version.
-->

<H2>
<a NAME="OverviewofPerformingaFullBuild"></a>Overview of 
Performing a Full Build
</H2>

<p>
To perform a full build, you need to follow these steps:

<ol>
  <li> Get the source code, either from the download webpage
    (<a href="http://download.openoffice.org/next/index.html">http://download.openoffice.org/next</a>)
    or alternatively via a check-out from the cvs tree against a release tag, 
    e.g. <em>OpenOffice_3_1_0</em>. </li>
    
    
    
   <li> Run the <CODE>configure</CODE> script in a cygwin bash shell to 
    check all requirements and to create the script <CODE>winenv.bat</CODE>. 
  </li>
  <li> Run the 

<CODE>winenv.bat</CODE> (under 4NT)  script to set all environment variables.
	<p>Please see the last screen from the configure script for more specific
	information on setting up for your platform.</p>
  </li>
   
  <li> Build typing <CODE>dmake</CODE> in <CODE>$SRC_ROOT</CODE>, or 
    <CODE>build --all</CODE> in the <CODE>instetoo_native</CODE> module, or 
    <CODE>build</CODE> followed by <CODE>deliver</CODE> in the individual 
    modules. </li>
	
</ol>

For detailed build instructions, see the section 
<a href="#BuildingaFullBuildofOpenOffice">Building a Full Build of the Office 
Suite</a> in this document. The installation procedure is described 
<a href="#InstallInstructions">at the end</a> of this document.

<H2> 
<a NAME="OverviewofBuildinganIndividualProject"></a>Overview of Building 
an Individual Project
</H2>
<p>
You can use a prebuilt version to build an individual project. Having a 
prebuilt version is necessary because the individual project you want to 
build could depend on other projects. A project builds a particular component 
of OpenOffice.org. For example, the Word Processing project builds the Word 
Processing application. To build an individual project, you must follow these 
steps: 
<ol>
  <li> Download the appropriate solver tarballs from the download webpage
    (<a href="http://download.open office.org/index.html">http://download.openoffice.org/index.html</a>)
    e.g., for 643B the solver tarball 
     
     
    <CODE>solver643B_win32intel.tar.gz.</CODE> 
    
	<p>643 is a very old release.  Please use the <a href="../builds/">latest</a>
	   version.</p>
  </li>

  <li> Check out the modules for the project that you want to build from the 
    OpenOffice.org cvs tree. If your project uses the resources module, 
    <CODE>res</CODE>, check 
    out this module also. You can, of course, also download the entire source 
    from the download webpage 
    (<a href="http://download.openoffice.org/index.html">http://download.openoffice.org/index.html</a>). 
    However, it is not possible to download individual modules there. </li>
  <li> Check out the module <CODE>config_office</CODE>. This is always necessary
    to create the build environment. </li>
  <li> Also check out the modules <CODE>dmake, external, sal, solenv, soltools,
     vos, tools, rsc and xml2cmp</CODE>.
  
  </li>
  <li> Unpack the solver tarball in the <CODE>$SRC_ROOT</CODE> directory. </li>
  
  
   
   
   
  <li> Run the <CODE>configure</CODE> script in a cygwin bash shell to 
    check all requirements and to create the script <CODE>winenv.bat</CODE>.
  <p>Note that all paths should NOT contain spaces.  This will confuse dmake later.</p>
  </li>
   
  <li> Run
    
     
     
    <CODE>winenv.bat</CODE> 
    to set all environment variables and build dmake.exe. 
  </li>
   
  <li> Build each module against the prebuilt <CODE>solver</CODE> using the <CODE>build</CODE> 
    tool, followed by <CODE>deliver</CODE>. </li>
</ol>

<a href="#BuildingIndividualProjects">Building Individual Projects with a 
Prebuilt</a>.

<h2>
<a NAME="BuildRequirements"></a>Build Requirements
</h2>

<p>
Before you start building, you must ensure that your system satisfies the
recommended software and hardware requirements for the type of system you
are working on. For   
 Windows,  these are as follows:</p>





see <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Build_Windows_Requirements">Windows Build Requirements</a>





<H2>
<a NAME="GetTheSourceCode"></a>Get the source code
</H2>

<p>
You have two options to get the source code:

<ul>

<li>
Download the source code tarball 
(<a href="http://download.openoffice.org/3.1.0/source.html">http://download.openoffice.org/3.1.0/source.html</a>),
e.g. <CODE>OOo_3.1.0_src_core.tar.gz</CODE> in case of the 3.1 stable release.
<p>
Unpack the tarballs as follows:</p>
<pre>
<KBD>&gt; tar -xvzf OOo_3.1.0_src_core.tar.gz</KBD>
<KBD>&gt; cd OOO300m9</KBD> 
</pre>
<p>This will be $SRC_ROOT from now on. Please check <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Getting_It">the OpenOffice.org Wiki</a> for more detailed information about the source tarballs.</p>
</li>

<li>
Another possibility is to check out the code from the subversion tree. 

The non-bold slash means that the command should be in one line. It is 
possible to update an already existing older copy to a newer release: 
<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT&gt; svn</KBD> /
<KBD>    co svn://svn.services.openoffice.org/ooo/tags/OpenOffice_3_1_0</KBD> /
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A note on the tags (i.e. the argument to the -r option in the cvs commands listed above): 
If <em>trunk</em> is used as a tag, you will get the newest latest source code. This, 
however, will most likely not build since development is going on there. 
See <a href="http://tools.openoffice.org#CWS">http://tools.openoffice.org#CWS</a>
for a description of the development process with child workspaces and
<a href="http://eis.services.openoffice.org/EIS2/servlet/GuestLogon">
<strong>E</strong>nvironment <strong>I</strong>nformation <strong>S</strong>ystem</a>
for the current child workspaces and milestones.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<H2>
<a NAME="GeneratingtheBuildEnvironmentandBuildTools"></a>Generating the Build 
Environment and Build Tools
</H2>



<p>
Ideally, in keeping with the principles of open source, you would use an open 
source shell to build on a computer running a Win32 operating system.  
However, you 
decided to use a non-open source shell to build on a computer running a Win32 
operating system: the 4NT command shell. </p>
<p>
On the other hand, the <CODE>bash</CODE> shell from the cygwin tools is needed to run 
the <CODE>configure</CODE> script which generates the build environment.  The 
<CODE>configure</CODE> script checks that all software, hardware, and system 
requirements for the build are satisfied, and it creates a configuration file 
called <CODE>winenv.bat</CODE> that sets all necessary 
build environment variables and builds the <CODE>dmake.exe</CODE>.
See the example below. 


<p> 
This configuration file is created in the <CODE>SRC_ROOT</CODE> directory. 
A top-level makefile script <CODE>makefile.mk</CODE>  
are moved into <CODE>SRC_ROOT</CODE> as well. This is due to technical reasons: 
The <CODE>SRC_ROOT</CODE> directory in the cvs tree can only hold directories. 
On the other hand, the top-level <CODE>makefile.mk</CODE> should logically be 
placed in the top-level directory <CODE>SRC_ROOT</CODE>. The cvs tree holds 
these files in <CODE>config_office</CODE> and <CODE>configure</CODE> copies 
them up. 









<p>
The following should demonstrate in detail what steps have to be done to 
set up the environment:</p> 
<b>As 4nt is not the only possible shell, you have to enable the use of 4NT
with <CODE>--with-use-shell=4nt</CODE></b>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>
  Run the configure script according to the following example. We 
  assume here that</p> 

  <ul>

    <li>
      the source code is in <CODE>C:\OOO300_m9</CODE>
    </li>
    <li>
      JDK 1.4.1_02 is installed in <CODE>C:\j2sdk1.4.1_02</CODE>
    </li>
    <li>
      the Microsoft Compiler is located in 
      <CODE>c:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7</CODE>.
    </li>
    <li>
      and your zip.exe and unzip.exe are in <CODE>C:\unzip</CODE>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
  Running the configure script could then look like the following (bold typed 
  text is what you enter):

  <p>
  <CODE>
  (open a cygwin bash shell)
  <br>
  <b>cd /cygdrive/c/OOO310_m11/config_office</b>
  <br>
  <b>./configure --with-cl-home="/cygdrive/c/Programme/Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003/Vc7" --with-jdk-home=/cygdrive/c/j2sdk1.4.1_02 --with-unzip-home=/cygdrive/c/unzip --with-use-shell=4nt</b>
  <br>
  .
  <br>
  .
  <br>
  .
  <br>
  (some screen output here)
  <br>
  .
  <br>
  .
  <br>
  .
  <br>
  (more screen output here)
  <br>
  bash-2.02$ <b>exit</b>
  <br>
  </CODE>
  </p> 
</li>

</ul>

You should exit the bash shell. Now you can run the environment
settings file <CODE>winenv.bat</CODE> from your 4NT shell.

<p>
Note the change in pathname notation. Since the cygwin bash 
shell won't accept backslashes, paths have to be typed in a 
cygwin bash notation which is <CODE>/cygdrive/c/path/to/file</CODE>, 
instead of <CODE>C:\path\to\file</CODE>. This may appear 
confusing at the moment, but sticking to this notation will 
work.

<p>
There are a number of further options that you can use with the 
<CODE>configure</CODE> script. To display these options, type 
the following command:

<pre>
<KBD>config_office&gt; bash configure --help</KBD>
</pre>






<p>
After running <CODE>configure</CODE> you have to execute the 
configuration file which sets all environment variables. The generated
file is called <CODE>winenv.bat</CODE>.
</p>


<p> 
If you experiment with the newest sources from the cvs-tree, mind that updates 
to the configure process may not happen via updates of <CODE>configure</CODE>
(the script file) but via the files <CODE>configure.in</CODE> and 
<CODE>set_soenv.in</CODE>. The configure script itself is created from 
<CODE>configure.in</CODE> using the 
<CODE>autoreconf</CODE> command. The perl script set_soenv is created when you
run configure from set_soenv.in.
</p>

<p>If you need to modify or create a correct configure you would run commands 
like the following: 

<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT&gt; cd config_office</KBD>
<KBD>config_office&gt; cvs update configure.in</KBD>
get a bash shell
<KBD>config_office&gt;bash autoconf</KBD>
exit the bash shell
</pre>


To update the <CODE>configure</CODE> script. If you only use code from the 
snapshot releases on the web, you don't need to be concerned about this.

<H2>
<a NAME="BuildingaFullBuildofOpenOffice"></a>Building 
a Full Build of the Office Suite
</H2>

Now you are ready to build OpenOffice.org. To build the entire suite, all you 
have to do (after having created the environment as described above) is to run 
dmake from the top-level directory. This may take several hours. 

<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT&gt; dmake</KBD>
</pre>

<p>If you wish to control the build more you can perform a build with local
install sets or tarballs.</p>

<ul>
	<li>instsetoo_native will create rpm's or the actual delivery package for
	   your platform.</li>
	<li>instsetoo will create a single tar file containing the build however it
	   is deprecated.</li>
</ul>

<pre>
	cd $SRC_ROOT
	cd instetoo_native
	build --all
</pre>




<p>
If you decide to rebuild a module or build each module individually (mind 
dependencies!), you will have to use the <CODE>build</CODE> tool. A subsequent 
<CODE>deliver</CODE> will copy all created binaries, libraries etc. into the 
solver tree:

<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/(module)&gt; build</KBD>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/(module)&gt; deliver</KBD>
</pre>

<p>
The following table shows the time required to build on a system with a 
particular specification. You can use these details to estimate the time
required to build on your system.</p>

<a NAME="BuildingIndividualProjects"></a>Building 
Individual Projects with a Prebuilt
</H2>

<p>
OpenOffice.org is organised in several projects. For example, 
the Word Processing Project. These in turn consist of several 
modules, organised in separate directories. The source contains 
approximately 90 modules. 

<p> 
You can build any project or module individually. Building modules 
individually should not be misunderstood as reducing OpenOffice.org to a 
special application, say, for instance, the spreadsheet application. The 
program will always consist of the entire office suite: text processor, 
spreadsheet, drawing application, etc. Building individual 
modules comes in handy if you want to develop on a certain module. 
Most modules will depend on other modules to be already built. 
In other words, all modules must build in a particular order. To avoid 
building all modules which are prerequisites of the module of your 
interest, you can make use of a prebuilt <CODE>solver</CODE> tree against 
which you can build any module. 

<p>
For more information on modules and on the sequence that they build in, and 
on the dependencies, see 
<a href="http://tools.openoffice.org/modules.html">tools.openoffice.org/modules.html</a>.

<p> 
You have to download the <CODE>solver</CODE> tree as a tarball. For example 
 
 
 
<CODE>solver643B_win32int.tar.gz</CODE> 
from the Download page at 
<a href="http://download.openoffice.org/index.html">http://download.openoffice.org/index.html</a>,
use a current release 643 is very old and only used as an example,
and unpack it in the <CODE>$SRC_ROOT</CODE> directory, e.g.: 
<pre>



<KBD>$SRC_ROOT&gt; tar -xvzf solver643B_win32int.tar.gz</KBD>

</pre>



In order to create the build environment and build tools, you also have to 
check out the <CODE>config_office</CODE> module and <CODE>solenv</CODE>.


<p>
To build a project, you build each of its modules individually in their 
directory with the <CODE>build</CODE> tool, followed by <CODE>deliver</CODE> 
to copy the created libraries, binaries etc. into the solver tree: 
<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/(module-name)&gt; build</KBD>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/(module-name)&gt; deliver</KBD>
</pre>

Files called <CODE>build.lst</CODE> in the directories 
<CODE>(module-name)/prj</CODE> contain all information about the 
subdirectories to be build (each of them containing makefiles 
<CODE>makefile.mk</CODE>), about internal dependencies, and also about 
modules the current module depends on. The files 
<CODE>(module-name)/prj/d.lst</CODE> control the actions done by 
<CODE>deliver</CODE>. The last or second to last directory to be build is 
usually <VAR>module-name</VAR><CODE>/util</CODE> which is responsible for 
linking one or more shared libraries.
-->

<H2>
<a NAME="BuildingaProjectwithDebugInformation"></a>Building

</H2>

<p>
To rebuild a complete project with debug information, remove all object
files by removing the 


<CODE>wntmsci10.pro</CODE> 
directory. Then run <CODE>build</CODE> with the debug option set to true:

<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/(module)&gt; rm -rf wntmsci10.pro</KBD>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/(module)&gt; build debug=true</KBD>
</pre>

<br><br><br>

<h2>
<a NAME="InstallInstructions"></a>Instructions to Build 
an Installation Set
</h2>

<p>
The build process (started with a top-level <CODE>dmake</CODE> or 
<CODE>build --all</CODE> in <CODE>$SRC_ROOT/instsetoo_native</CODE>) will create 
an installation sets in English. 
A simple <CODE>build</CODE> in <CODE>$SRC_ROOT/instsetoo_native</CODE>
will also create the installation sets, provided all other modules are
already built. 

<p>
If you have built an installation set earlier and want to re-build it, 
please delete the local outpath first: 
<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT/instsetoo_native&gt; rm -rf wntmsci10.pro</KBD>
</pre>

<p>
The English installation set will be located at 
<CODE>$SRC_ROOT/instsetoo_native/wntmsci10.pro/OpenOffice/install/en-US</CODE>. 
Execute the <CODE>setup</CODE> binary to install:
<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT&gt; cd instsetoo_native/wntmsci10.pro/OpenOffice/install/en-US</KBD>
<KBD>en-US&gt; setup.exe</KBD>
</pre>

The en-US in the path names indicates that the localization is American English.
This value corresponds to the language tags defined by RFC 1766 (Tags for the
Identification of Languages).
The German installation set will be located in a de subdirectory. This scheme holds
true for all localizations you may have chosen explicitly (see next section 
<a href="#BuildingLocalized">Building Localized Versions of OpenOffice.org</a>). 

<p>
For a network installation, use the <CODE>-net</CODE> option to 
<CODE>setup</CODE>. Details on the network installation process 
can be found at 
<a href="http://installation.openoffice.org/proposals/netinstall.html">
http://installation.openoffice.org/proposals/netinstall.html</a> 
in the installation project webpage.
</p>
<p>For information on creating an automated

<br><br><br>


<H2>
<a NAME="BuildingLocalized"></a>Building Localized Versions of OpenOffice.org
</H2>

<p>
Running the configure script with the --with-lang option will introduce the build
of additional language resources. This switch accepts one or more RFC 1766 language
tags as arguments, unfortunately not all languages are supported. Check the value
of the <CODE>completelangiso</CODE> macro in <CODE>$SRC_ROOT/solenv/inc/postset.mk</CODE>
for all the currently supported language tags.
</p>
<p>
Example: <CODE>--with-lang="de fr"</CODE> enables the build of the localized german and
french version.
</p>
<p>
The environment variable <CODE>WITH_LANG</CODE>
will then contain the language tags of the additional (en-US will always be build)
languages.
</p>

<br><br><br>


<H2>
<a NAME="BuildingLangpack"></a>Building Localized Language Packs
</H2>

<p>
If you build additional localized languages it is possible to generate Language Packs
that contain only the changes needed to add the additional language to an OpenOffice.org
of a different language.
</p>
<p>
The following commands will generate language packs languages that were specified
with the --with-lang switch during the configure phase. Note that you can only build the
language packs <b>after</b> you have build the complete office with all selected
languages.
</p>
<pre>
<KBD>$SRC_ROOT&gt; cd instsetoo_native/util; dmake ooolanguagepack</KBD>

<H2>Tuning the Working Set</H2>
<H3>Windows 
</H3>
<P>Working Set Tuner :  Former version of the Platform Win32 SDK
included a tool named working set tuner. It is possible to create an
instrumetalized version of your application, gather runtime data
about called function, and then to produce an optimized link order.
This optimized link order causes less page load when starting the
application. In old version of StarOffice we achieved ~30% better
startup performance. Unfortunately the use of the working set tuner
failed with the use of exceptions in the office code. 
</P>
<P>The working set tuner has removed by Microsoft from the Platform
SDK for years now. There is now a new project in &quot;MSJ
Bugslayer&quot;, &quot;Smooth Working Set Tuner&quot;, which tries to
succeed the WST.

. Unfortunately this tools does not run with OpenOffice.org yet.</P>

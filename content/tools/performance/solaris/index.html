<P><A NAME="StartupTime"><h3>Startup Time</h3></A></P>
<P>As a base of discussion, build SRC632 was installed 
on Solaris two ways, on local disk and on NFS mounted disk, 
and then timed how long it takes StarOffice to startup.
The hardware is a Ultra 10 with a sparcv9 processor
operating at 440 MHz and a sparcv9 FPU. RAM is 128MB.
The OS is Solaris 2.8.
<P>Note:
The first of each pair of numbers is the time (in seconds)
it takes to "splash" image appears, the second is the time
it takes to first application window appears (including
the first number).

<P>Observations:
<OL>
<li>There is a big difference between mounted disk and local disk.
This is due to the time required by Solaris to load the application executable, 
its shared libraries, and some data files (such as font files) into memory 
by streaming them across the network for NFS mounted installation.  
<li>The initial invocation takes much longer than
subsequent invocations, after three invocations, the numbers stabilize. 
This is due to caching and memory mapping so that some of the binaries
need not be reloaded at subsequent invocations.
</OL> 
In order to reduce startup time, it should be very helpful to reduce the number 
and the size of these binary files being loaded. Using truss command 
shows a number of large files were loaded.  
By the way, in SRC632 (vs SRC627), many large data files are no 
longer loaded, most shared libraries are slightly larger, some libraries 
and some data files are smaller.  
The following is a list of files 1 MB or larger:
<pre>
 15.3MB libsvx632ss.so
 15.1MB libsw632ss.so
  6.3MB libsfx632ss.so
  6.1MB libxo632ss.so
  4.6MB libsvt632ss.so
  4.1MB libvcl632ss.so
  3.9MB liblocaledata_ascii.so
  3.6MB libcfgmgr2.so
  3.0MB libi18n632ss.so
  2.8MB applicat.rdb
  2.5MB libtk632ss.so
  2.2MB libstlport_sunpro.so
  2.1MB liblnn632ss.so
  1.9MB libbasctl632ss.so
  1.7MB libdbtools2.so
  1.6MB libset632ss.so
  1.4MB libso632ss.so
  1.6MB libsvl632ss.so
  1.2MB libsal2.so
  1.1MB libtl632ss.so
  1.1MB libfwk632ss.so
  1.0MB libsb632ss.so

</pre>
<p>The next step is to find out which of these files need not be loaded
during startup.  The data files will be examined later.  As for the
shared libraries, the sotruss command was tried but did not yield
useful results.  <a href="#UsingProfiler">Profiling</a> with gprof,
assisted by other ways, was used instead to find out which libraries 
have no or few symbols invoked.  The summary results are shown below. 
The list of symbols invoked during startup from each library can be
found at this <A HREF="symbol_list.html">link</A>:

</TABLE>
<P>As the above table shows, four libraries with only a few symbols 
invoked during startup.  The total size of these 4 libraries is 
about 10MB.  Here is a proposal that may be able to reduce startup 
time which is yet to be proven.
We may be able to split the libraries into two libraries. 
Basically we keep the few symbols that are invoked in the current 
library and link all the 
remaining symbols into a new library within the same project. 
The new library would be built first and the current library would 
be built. In addition, the current library would be lazily linked 
against the new library so that other projects can still link 
against the current library to get the symbols in the new library. 
The lazy linking, however, would defer loading of the new library 
until after startup.
If later we found some libraries that have no symbols that are invoked
during startup, we can use lazy linking to defer their loading 
to after startup.  
<P>The splitting of a shared library is experimented and worked as we
expected, however, the lazyloading part is not working as we expected.
Work is in progress to find the cause and/or workaround.
In addition to splitting a shared library, it may be possible to
modify the code so that the symbol invoked during startup don't
need to be invoked.  This needs to be examined on a symbol by symbol
basis and side effects needs to be avoided.
<P>This work is in progress, please stay tuned.
  
<P><A NAME="UsingProfiler"><h3>Using the Profiler</h3></A></P>
<P>We can use the Solaris profiler gprof to find out which
symbols of a given shared library are invoked by the startup 
executable soffice.bin (and javaldx).  The following are the steps:
<ol>
<li>We must first dmake project desktop with profile=true.  
Make sure r1.12 (or later revision) of 
solenv/inc/unxsols3.mk is used to avoid a link problem of javaldx
where there was a conflict among /usr/lib, libstlport_sunpro.so and 
WorkShop 6 profiling libraries.  This will produce soffice.bin and javaldx  
executables that were 1linked with the profiling library.
<li>We can then use LD_PROFILE to set the shared library we want to profile. 
In order to find out if a shared library is invoked by startup,
the library must not have stripped the symbols using mapfiles.
For those libraries that use mapfiles as a default, the 
SHLnVERSIONMAP=$(TARGET).map line in the makefile.mk (usually
in util directory) should be commented out 
(where SHLn may be SHL1, SHL2, etc.)
Please note that LD_PROFILE allows to be set to one library at a time.
When LD_PROFILE is set, running soffice and then gprof will result
a profile output detailing the call graph and the symbols called
statistics (see man gprof).
<li>Due to profiler's limitation, some shared libraries (for example,
liblnn632ss.so) may appear 
no symbols that are invoked by the startup executable soffice.bin,
may turned out to be UNO components loaded via dlsym and were
not detectable by the profiler.  Therefore, we need to supplement the
profiling steps with a debug step as follows: use r1.17 or later revision of file 
$SRC_ROOT/sal/osl/unx/module.c and dmake $SRC_ROOT/sal with debug=true,
then run soffice, we will get a debug trace output that includes
those libraries that have symbols loaded via dlsym. 
<li>There is yet another way of loading symbols, i.e., through UNO.  Investigation
must be done to figure out how these symbols are loaded.  Initial understanding
is that this way of loading is not used during startup (using debug=true to
build bridges project), but it needs to be verified.

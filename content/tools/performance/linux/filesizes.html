<H1>Excessive shared libraries file sizes</H1>
<P>Recent versions of OpenOffice/StarOffice exhibit an disturbing
increase in shared library file size. This is especially true for the
Unix platforms, topped by whopping 73% increase from SRC569 to SRC624
on Linux.</P>
<H2>Reasons</H2>
<P>The biggest increase in code size especially on GCC based
platforms is probably due to the increased use of exceptions. Since
abandoning exceptions is out of question we can't do much about this
currently. It's interesting to note that the use of exception
specifications which should in principle help reducing the costs of
exception handling has a pretty averse effect on GCC platforms.
Exception specifications increase the code size of callees by a
significant amount (up to 300 bytes for GCC/Linux/X86 per method!),
without having a noticeable effect on the code size of the caller.
Even the empty exception specification throw() applied to a leave
(non calling) function incurs this cost. This is clearly a very
pronounced deficiency of GCC.</P>
<H2>Solutions</H2>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Remove all exception specifications, especially on all inline
	functions. This seems to be the only possible way to reduce the code
	size of gcc-2.95.2 build libraries significantly. <BR><BR>Some
	preliminary evaluation of gcc-3.0 indicates that the gcc developers
	noticed this problem. Gcc-3.0 offers a switch which allows the
	compiler to not to enforce the exception specifications.
	Additionally the compiler is much more able in recognizing that
	some functions will never throw and produces way smaller code in
	this case even in the case of honored exception specifications. It
	might be very worthwhile to switch to gcc-3.0 when it's ready.
	Gcc-3.0 is scheduled to be available at the end of the 1Q 2001. The
	downside of Gcc-3.0 will be that it's in no way binary compatible to
	gcc-2.95.2</P>
	<P>Update 2000/05/28: gcc-2.95.3 (bugfix release) seems to produce
	more compact code in some cases. It has not yet been investigated if
	this improvement is related to exception specifications. Anyway,
	improvements from 0.4% up to 20% can be observed. Preliminary tests
	have been done on SRC633, details can be found <A HREF="comparison.html">here</A>.</P>
	<LI><P>Export minimized shared libraries could be smaller on
	GCC/GNU-binutils platforms. The GNU ld has a deficiency regarding
	minimizing the .dynstr section of a shared library if version map
	are used to minimize the exports from the library. All it's does is
	to remove the references of the &quot;localized&quot; strings from
	the .dyntab, but it never deletes the strings itself from the
	.dynstr section. Neither does &quot;strip&quot;. <BR><BR>The Mozilla
	developers noticed this, too. They invented a small tool called
	&quot;elf-gc-dynstr&quot; which removes the unused strings and than
	relocates the references to the remaining stuff in the .dyntab
	section. Some tests showed that this operation has no side effects
	and does reduce the overall size of the *.so files by about 2.5% to
	3.5%.

	<BR><BR>GCC tends to the create a vtable even in the case of a class
	with only pure virtual methods. Another problem is that certain
	inlined static constructs end up in every object file but not in the
	link-once section. Thus ld fails to combine these constructs at
	shared library link time.<BR><BR>I tried the patch but didn't see
	any improvement in code size. The opposite was true, the file size
	did even increase.<BR><BR><BR>

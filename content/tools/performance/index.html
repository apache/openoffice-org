<H2>OpenOffice.org Performance Tuning 
</H2>
<P>This page contains a general list of areas that affect how fast
the OpenOffice.org application runs. A brief description of the
current and/or recent work is provided for each area. For application
specific optimization possibilities see the project pages (e.g. for
the <A HREF="http://sw.openoffice.org/drafts/optimization.html">Writer</A>).</P>
<P>An overview of  current and planned performance improvements can
be found <A HREF="./performance-activities-overview.html">here</A>.</P>
<P>In addition, a description of the profiling tools for each
platform and how to use them within the OpenOffice.org build is
provided. 
</P>
<P>If you would like to share any performance tuning work that you
are currently doing or have already done, please send your suggested
updates to for this page to <A HREF="mailto:martin.hollmichel@sun.com">martin.hollmichel@sun.com</A>.

<H3>OpenOffice.org performance issues</H3>
<P>Currently, OpenOffice.org application performance issues can be
grouped into the following two categories: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P><A NAME="StartupTime"></A><B>Startup Time of the
	Openoffice.org Application</B> 
	</P>
	<P>There are several items that can influence the startup of an
	application:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>Size of Application Binaries</P>
		<P>As the size of the OpenOffice.org application binaries
		increases, startup time increases. This increased startup time is
		due to the time required by the operating system to physically read
		the application executable and its shared libraries into memory.
		The increase in startup time is particularly noticeable when the
		OpenOffice.org binaries reside on mounted disk since the binaries
		need to be streamed across the network between the machine with the
		exported disk and the local machine where OpenOffice.org is being
		run.</P>
		<P>There are several ways to reduce the size of the OpenOffice.org
		application binaries and, in turn, decrease startup time <B>without
		changing any of the OpenOffice.org source code</B>:</P>
		<UL>
			<LI><P>Reducing the amount of code that is loaded at startup</P>
			<P>Ideally, all of the symbols necessary for startup would be put
			in separate binaries from the symbols used after startup. Also,
			the runtime linker would load only the startup binaries and would
			defer loading of the remaining binaries until after startup. 
			</P>
			<P>Currently, Sun engineers in Cupertino, California are working
			on moving the existing Solaris Sparc build to be closer to the
			ideal. <A HREF="solaris/index.html#StartupTime">Click here</A> for
			a detailed description of this effort.</P>
			<LI><P><A NAME="Stripping"></A>Stripping the application binaries</P>
			<P>On all Unix platforms, the symbol table within each executable
			and shared library adds considerable size (approximately 40 MB on
			the Linux Intel and Solaris Sparc platforms). Since the symbol
			table is not needed at runtime, the <CODE>strip</CODE> command can
			be used to eliminate these extra size from the OpenOffice.org
			binaries on most, if not all, of the Unix platforms.</P>
			<P>Automatic stripping of Unix binaries is now available in the
			installation set creation process (see the <A HREF="#ToDos">To
			Do's</A> section).</P>
			<P>You can enable stripping of the OpenOffice.org binaries on all
			Unix platforms except Mac OS X by executing the following command
			after you have completely built OpenOffice.org:</P>
			<P><CODE>cd $SRC_ROOT/instsetoo ; dmake &quot;strip=true&quot;</CODE></P>
			<P>You can then install OpenOffice.org as you normally would using
			the following command:</P>
			<P><CODE>cd $SRC_ROOT/instsetoo/$INPATH/normal ; ./setup</CODE></P>
			<P><B>Important note:</B> The above commands will not strip
			binaries for builds before SRC634. So, if you want to enable
			stripping in an earlier build, you must execute the following
			commands before executing the above commands: 
			</P>
			<P><CODE>cd $SRC_ROOT/scptools/source/linker</CODE><BR><CODE>cvs
			update -A lzip.cxx scpzip.cxx</CODE><BR><CODE>cd
			$SRC_ROOT/scptools ; dmake</CODE><BR><CODE>cd
			$SRC_ROOT/instsetoo/util</CODE><BR><CODE>cvs update -A makefile.mk</CODE></P>
		</UL>
		<LI><P>Unused Code</P>
		<P>Removing any unused code would reduce the size of the
		OpenOffice.org binaries which, in turn, would reduce startup time.
		Since almost all the OpenOffice.org binaries are shared libraries,
		analysis of each exported symbol could potentially determine which
		local symbols within each shared library not used and such symbols
		could be eliminated from the code. However, no work has been done
		in this area so the amount of unused code within the OpenOffice.org
		is currently unknown.</P>
		<P>Anyone who attempts such analysis should double check that their
		analysis includes any invocations of unexported symbols. Such
		invocations are frequently executed by the UNO runtime via v-table
		lookups and less frequently by the direct symbol lookup within the
		osl_getSymbol function in the sal/inc/osl/module.h source file.</P>
		<LI><P><A HREF="working_set.html">Working Set</A></P>
		<LI><P>Memory Footprint</P>
		<LI><P>Hot Spots</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P><B>Post-Startup Speed of the Openoffice.org Application</B></P>
	<P>Nearly all of the issues listed in the <A HREF="#StartupTime">Startup
	Time</A> section are equally applicable to post-startup speed of the
	OpenOffice.org application.</P>
	<P>In addition, the following items also affect post-startup speed: 
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>Symbol Size Optimizations</P>
		<P>Potentially, the use of certain compiler or linker options can
		increase or decrease the size of binaries. For example, enabling
		exceptions on Solaris Sparc increases code size by a noticeable
		amount. 
		</P>
		<P>Currently, Sun engineers in Cupertino, California are looking
		for compiler and linker options that can decrease code size. Since
		this is a difficult task to do given the large total size of the
		OpenOffice.org binaries, Sun engineers are analyzing the <A HREF="binary_diffs_52_60.html">increases
		in binary sizes</A> on Linux Intel and Solaris Sparc from
		StarOffice 5.2 to a recent build. Hopefully, by analyzing the
		changes in the list and/or sizes of the symbols in the binaries
		with the largest growth, specific types of compiler or linker
		options (and maybe even coding constructs) that cause symbol size
		to increase or decrease will be found. Stay tuned for updates.</P>
		<LI><P>Save/Load Optimization of OpenOffice.org 6.0 files (XML) <A HREF="http://xml.openoffice.org/optimization.html">see
		more</A></P>
		<P>Now the new file format of OpenOffice.org is feature complete
		and so it is time to analyse the performance.</P>
		<P>Now we have to find the own problems of the applications. The
		performance of Save/Load OpenOffice.org 6.0 files has to be checked
		in every OpenOffice.org application.</P>

<H3>Tools</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Profiling</P>
	<P>By default, the OpenOffice.org build is <B>not</B> built for
	profiling. You can enable profiling by rebuilding each module that
	you want to profile by executing the following command:</P>
	<P><CODE>cd $SRC_ROOT/(module)</CODE> <CODE>dmake -u &quot;profile=true&quot;</CODE>
		</P>

	<CODE>gprof</CODE> on Solaris. <A HREF="solaris/index.html#UsingProfiler">Click
	here</A> for a detailed instructions for using <CODE>gprof</CODE> on
	Solaris.</P>
	<LI><P>Profiling II</P>
	<P>There is another environment which provides profiling data on a
	more abstracted level then the known (commercial) tools. The goal is
	to have a fully automatic process that generates, processes, and
	analyzes the profiling data. Please see <A HREF="../profiling/index.html">this</A>

<p>Optimizer.pl &#8211; tool for eliminating redundant exported
symbols.</p>
<p>Make new optimized .def-file (first step) or make lists of
unused export symbols (as second step).</p>
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>perl optimizer.pl [-pro] -c|a</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>-a</p>
<p>Analyse the stand. This should be used as a first step. New,
optimized .def files are produced on this step.</p>
<p>It is recommended when finished this first step to build the
libraries with modified wnt.mk. If you remove /OPT:NOREF option for
linker in this file, you'll get fully optimized version of
libraries (there's no guarantee that it will be working version).
You get also correspondent .map file. It seems to worth efforts to
analyse stand again and rebuild libraries, since now some unused
imported symbols might be thrown away.</p>
<p>-c</p>
<p>Compare the lists. This should be used as a first step. On this
step new .map files and old .map-files are compared and file with
obsolete symbols is stored in the same directory as .obs, where
these two are.</p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>This tool is a Perl script, its functionality is implemented on
analysis of .def and .map files produced by MS linker cl.exe. It
must be started from the main directory of the stand with
options:</p>
<p>The tool looks for the symbols imported from another libraries
in correspondent .map files and makes a complete table of used
symbols (CTS) in memory, than .def file for each library is parsed
and if there are symbols which are not found in CTS, than they are
thrown away in new .def file. Former .def file is backed up as
.olddef if there were no .olddef file before. You get the entire
list of the libraries and projects to be rebuilt if any new .def
files were made. There are some symbols which are exported a
priori, they are:</p>
<p>component_getDescriptionFunc</p>
<p>component_getImplementationEnvironment</p>
<p>component_getFactory</p>
<p>component_writeInfo</p>
<p>This table can be enlarged when needed.</p>

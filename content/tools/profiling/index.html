<H2>OpenOffice.org Profiling Tools</H2>
<P>In order to speed up the startup time of OpenOffice applications
we have developed a set of tools to derive profiling data from those
applications. Our approach differs from that of other (commercial)
tools in the following points:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P>The information that we gather from the applications covers
  larger blocks of code suitable for an overall analysis instead of
  logging every code line or every instruction.</P>
  <LI><P>The ability to write profiling information is compiled
  automatically into the code at (almost) every build.</P>
  <LI><P>Profiling data from different runs can be compared to each
  other, so that an automatic analysis can take place that informs you
  about speed-ups or slow-downs from version to version.</P>
</UL>
<P>Your comments on the profiling tools and on this page are welcome.
Please send them to <A HREF="mailto:andre.w.fischer@sun.com">andre.w.fischer@sun.com</A>
or <A HREF="mailto:carsten.driesner@sun.com">carsten.driesner@sun.com</A>.</P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The profiling process can be divided into four steps:</P>
<OL>
  <LI><P>Add macros for writing time stamps to your code. This of
  course requires a rough idea at what code parts are too slow and need
  to be optimized. Don't write too much time stamps because of the
  runtime penalty and more important in a run time analysis on a much
  higher than code line level. This step has to be done only once, so
  the overhead of adding macros for writing time stamps should not be
  too high.</P>
  <LI><P>Run the office application you are interested in. This
  generates a log file that contains all time stamps. If you are
  interested in more then start-up or file-open times use the
  scripting functionality of the office.</P>
  <LI><P>Post process the log files. In this step you can filter away
  unwanted time stamps that would otherwise clutter the analysis
  results and obscure those parts that you are interested in. Also the
  time stamps can be augmented by additional information.</P>
  <LI><P>Analyze the log files and generate reports. Compare the new
  timings with those of previous runs. This enables you to see if a
  piece of code got slower or faster. Generation of automatic
  notifications of the responsible developers is also possible.</P>
</OL>
<H3>Status</H3>
<P>The classes, functions, and macros used for instrumenting the
source code in the first step are ready for using. See the section
<STRONG>Source Code</STRONG> for details.</P>
<P>There is a first set of Perl scripts for post processing and
generation of simple reports as Calc documents available. Both
post-processing and analysis will be extended in the near future. See
the <STRONG>Tools</STRONG> section for details.</P>
<H3><A NAME="source_code"></A>Source Code</H3>
<P>The classes and macros for writing the time stamps can be found in
the sal project of the udk. They are defined in the files
<CODE>sal/inc/rtl/logfile.h</CODE>, <CODE>sal/inc/logfile.hxx</CODE>,
and <CODE>sal/rtl/source/logfile.cxx</CODE>. For inclusion into your
source code use <CODE>#include &lt;rtl/logfile.h&gt;</CODE> or
<CODE>#include &lt;rtl/logfile.hxx&gt;</CODE> as described in the
How-To (see below under Documentation).</P>
<H3>Tools</H3>
<P>The scripts for post-processing the log files can be found in the
(sub) project tools/contrib/profiling. Note that you have to check
them out by hand.</P>
<P><A HREF="write-calc-doc.html">write-calc-doc.pl</A> transforms a
log file into a Calc document that contains two data sheets for every
thread. The first sheet displays a pretty printed version of the raw
data. The second sheet is made up by a table that contains for each
function or other scope the minimal, maximal, average, and total time
and the number of calls. More <A HREF="write-calc-doc.html">details</A>.</P>
<H3>Documentation</H3>
<P>There is a <A HREF="profiling-howto.html">How-To</A> that
describes how to instrument the source code so that profiling time
stamps are written to the log file.</P>
<P><A HREF="time-stamp-format.html">This</A> document describes the
format of the time stamps written to the log file.</P>
<P>The Calc document containing the documentation of the time stamps
that are written to the profiling log files is <A HREF="time-stamp-documentation.html">here</A>.while
some words on what to include into that file can be found <A HREF="time-stamp-documentation.html">here</A>.</P>
<H3>Communication</H3>
<P>The mailing list for discussing matters concerning this profiling
project is <A HREF="mailto:dev@tools.openoffice.org">dev@tools.openoffice.org</A>.</P>

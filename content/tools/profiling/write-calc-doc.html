<H2>write-calc-doc.pl</H2>
<P>The Perl script write-calc-doc.pl transforms a log file into a
Calc document containing two data sheets for every thread. The first
sheet displays a pretty printed version of the raw data. The second
sheet is made up by a table that contains for each function or other
scope the minimal, maximal, average, and total time and the number of
calls.</P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<P>write-calc-doc.pl &lt;log-file-name&gt; [&lt;calc-document-name&gt;]</P>
<P>The two arguments specify the name of the log-file to process and
an optional name under which to write the report.  If that name is
not given explicetly, then it is derived from the log-file name by
replacing the suffix <CODE>.log</CODE> by the suffix <CODE>.sxc</CODE>.</P>
<P>write-calc-doc.pl understands the following option parameters that
may stand anywhere on the command line (but of course behind the
script name):</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P>-h prints a short help text describing the command line
  parameters.</P>
  <LI><P>-i &lt;filename&gt; specifies a file that contains regular
  expressions (in Perl style). Every time stamp in the log file that
  matches at least one of these expressions is included into the
  report.</P>
  <LI><P>-e &lt;filename&gt; specifies a file that contains regular
  expressions (in Perl style). Every time stamp in the log file that
  matches at least one of these expressions is <B>not</B> included
  into the report.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Configuration</H3>
<P>There are several configuration features which the script tries to
determine automatically. If that fails you have to specify them
explicitly:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P>If the perl interpreter is not found you have to specify it
  on the command line: use <SAMP>&lt;perl-path&gt;/perl
  write-calc-doc.pl &lt;arguments&gt;</SAMP> instead of
  <SAMP>write-calc-doc.pl &lt;arguments&gt;</SAMP>.</P>
  <LI><P>The Perl script uses several modules in the sub-directory
  LogFile. If that sub-directory is not in your Perl search path and
  can't be deduced automatically from the script's own name then you
  have to pass that directory with the -I command line option to the
  perl interpreter: use <SAMP>&lt;perl-path&gt;/perl
  -I&lt;src-path&gt;/tools/contrib/profiling write-calc-doc.pl
  &lt;arguments&gt;.</SAMP></P>
  <LI><P>A zip executable is used to pack all XML files into a single
  archive. If no zip executable with the base name &#132;zip&#147; is
  found in the current search path, then you have to set the
  environment variables LOG_FILE_ZIP_COMMAND to the path name of the
  zip executable. The variable LOG_FILE_ZIP_FLAGS can be used to
  control it's behaviour.</P>
</UL>
<P>Usually it should be sufficient to say</P>
<P><SAMP>&lt;src-path&gt;/tools/contrib/profiling/write-calc-document.pl
/tmp/profiling_1234.log</SAMP></P>
<P>It creates the Calc document <CODE>/tmp/profiling_1234.sxc</CODE>.</P>
<H3>Filtering the log file</H3>
<P>On the command line you can specify two files with regular
expressions. These expressions are used to filter the time stamps in
the log file. A time stamp is taken into account for the report
generation if it a) matches at least one regular expression in the
inclusion filter file or that file is empty and b) matches none of
the regular expressions in the exclusion filter file or that file is
empty. The expressions in the filter files have to be written in the
Perl <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">syntax.</SPAN></P>
<H4>Filter Examples</H4>
<P>An inclusion filter file containing only the line</P>
<P><CODE>\(af119097\)</CODE></P>
<P>includes exactly those time stamps into the report that belong the
author with Sun id af119097.</P>
<P>An exclusion filter file containing only the line</P>
<P><CODE>^sch\b</CODE></P>
<P>removes all time stamps from the report that belong to the chart
project.</P>

<P>For writing filters suitable for a given task you should have a
look at the <A HREF="time-stamp-format.html">specification</A> of the
general time stamp format and the <A HREF="time-stamp-documentation.html">documentation</A>
of the time stamps emitted from the individual projects.</P>

<p>Apache OpenOffice is the leading <strong>open-source</strong> <strong>office software suite</strong> for <strong>word processing</strong>, <strong>spreadsheets</strong>, <strong>presentations</strong>, <strong>graphics</strong>, <strong>databases</strong> and more. It is available in <strong>many languages</strong> and works on all <strong>common computers</strong>. It stores all your data in an <strong>international open standard format</strong> and can also read and write files from other common office software packages. It can be downloaded and used completely <strong>free of charge</strong> for <strong>any purpose</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="why_great.html">Great software</a></p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice is the result of over twenty years&rsquo; software engineering. Designed from the start as a single piece of software, it has a consistency other products cannot match. A completely open development process means that anyone can report bugs, request new features, or enhance the software. The result: Apache OpenOffice does everything you want your office software to do, the way you want it to.</p>

<p><a href="why_easy.html">Easy to use</a></p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice is easy to learn, and if you&rsquo;re already using another office software package, you&rsquo;ll take to OpenOffice straight away. Our world-wide native-language community means that OpenOffice is probably available and supported in your own language. And if you already have files from another office package - OpenOffice will probably read them with no difficulty.</p>

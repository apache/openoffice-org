<h1>The Apache OpenOffice Project Announces Apache OpenOffice&trade; 3.4</h1>
<p>
<strong>Numerous enhancements to leading Open Source multi-platform, multi-lingual office productivity suite with over 
100M users worldwide; <a
	href="http://download.openoffice.org">downloads now available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh free of charge</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>www.OpenOffice.org &mdash;8 May 2012&mdash;</strong> The Apache OpenOffice Project today announced the 
availability of Apache OpenOffice&trade; 3.4, the first release of OpenOffice under the governance of the Apache Software 
Foundation.
</p>
<p>
Apache OpenOffice is the original open source office productivity suite, designed for professional and consumer use.
</p>
<p>
"With the donation of OpenOffice.org to the ASF, the Foundation, and especially the podling project, was given a daunting 
task: re-energize a community and transform OpenOffice from a codebase of unknown Intellectual Property heritage, to a 
vetted and Apache Licensed software suite," said Jim Jagielski, ASF President and an Apache OpenOffice project mentor. "The 
release of Apache OpenOffice 3.4 shows just how successful the project has been: pulling in developers from over 21 
corporate affiliations, while avoiding undue influence which is the death-knell of true open source communities; 
building a solid and stable codebase, with significant improvement and enhancements over other variants; and, of course, 
creating a healthy, vibrant and diverse user and developer community."
</p>
<p>
Apache OpenOffice is the leading open source office productivity suite, with more than 100 million users worldwide in 
home, corporate, government, research, and academic environments, across 15 languages. Apache OpenOffice 3.4 is <a

href="http://extensions.openoffice.org/">800 extensions</a>.
</p>
<h2>Community-Driven Development, The Apache Way</h2>
<p>
The OpenOffice code base was created by Star Division in the 1990's, acquired by Sun Microsystems in 
1999 and later Oracle Corporation in 2010, before being submitted to The Apache Software Foundation mid-2011.
</p>
<p>
Today the project is being developed by an all-volunteer group of developers, testers, translators, and other 
contributors under the ASF's meritocratic process informally dubbed "The Apache Way", and is supported by hundreds of 
Open Source software volunteers from around the world.
</p>
<p>
"Initially released a decade ago, the first release of OpenOffice 3.4 as an Apache project marks an important new chapter in the life of 
	a landmark project," said Stephen O'Grady, Principal Analyst with RedMonk. "Following months of effort, the open source productivity 
	suite is now licensed and built with the intent of courting a large population of users, developers and ISVs worldwide." 	
</p>	
<p>
As a project in the Apache Incubator, Apache OpenOffice is overseen by a Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) 
that guides its day-to-day operations, community development, and product releases. Apache OpenOffice source code, 
downloads, documentation, mailing lists, and related resources are available at <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/">http://openoffice.apache.org/</a>
</p>
<p>
For the first official Apache release of OpenOffice, the developer team successfully conformed to the policy defined by 
the Incubator Project Management Committee by identifying, removing and replacing with comparable function those 
libraries with licenses incompatible with Apache Software Foundation license policy.
</p>
<h2>Future Developments</h2>
<p>
Plans for future enhancements by the Project include support for additional native languages, enhanced accessibility, 
usability and performance improvements, and adopting new features and improvements from the upcoming IBM Lotus Symphony 
contribution.
</p>
<p>
The Apache OpenOffice Project Management Committee invites people to join. There are many different area where contribution is most 
welcome. Check out the <a

"Apache OpenOffice is the leading Open Source office productivity suite with more than 15 years of engineering 
investment. We are pleased and excited to offer OpenOffice fully licensed under the Apache License 2. This offering will 
form the foundation of OpenOffice innovation moving forward here at Apache," said Juergen Schmidt, Apache OpenOffice 
Release Manager and veteran core developer. "With the achievement of this major milestone, we have established a diverse 
and vibrant community with sufficient depth and skills to ably steward this important product into the future. We look 
forward to graduating as an Apache Top Level Project soon."

<h1>Testimonials</h1> <h2>Community</h2>

"OpenOffice.org was a revolution in its time as an office tool and its role launching the Open Document Format (ODF) 
standard. We are excited to see OpenOffice succeed at Apache which is recognized for its strong reputation to grow 
excellent projects. This milestone is evidence that the 'Apache Way', which respects the meritocracy of people 
contributing their time and talent to benefit their projects, is the key ingredient that makes Apache OpenOffice ideal 
for everyone." <br/>

"Apache OpenOffice 3.4 is a worthy progression of OpenOffice.org. Many improvements have been completed, which 
originally began for OpenOffice.org, but we have also added a lot of new features, all with usual high quality our users 
have come to expect. Use Apache OpenOffice 3.4 for your personal, business, or education requirements, and reward the 
work of the many volunteers who have made this possible. The Germanophone contributors will continue to support you and 
listen to your questions, requests and suggestions. Together we will continue to shape the future of OpenOffice at 
Apache." <br/>

community helped with translations and quality assurance, to make sure that Apache OpenOffice 3.4 is on par with what

re-used in other projects, and I am looking forward to cross-project collaboration in the best interest of users." <br/>

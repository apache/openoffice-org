  <h2>The Apache Software Foundation Statement on Apache OpenOffice</h2>
  <p><em>14 October 2011:</em> On 1 June 2011, Oracle Corporation submitted the OpenOffice.org code base to The Apache
  Software Foundation. That submission was accepted, and the project is now being developed as a podling in the Apache
  Incubator under the ASF's meritocratic process informally dubbed "The Apache Way". OpenOffice.org is now officially part
  of the Apache family. The project is known as Apache OpenOffice. Over its 12-year history, the ASF has
  welcomed contributions from individuals and organizations alike, but, as a policy, does not solicit code donations. The
  OpenOffice.org code base was not pursued by the ASF prior to its acceptance into the Apache Incubator.

  <p><em>20 October 2008:</em> <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>, the open-source platform and IDE for Java
  development celebrates its 10th birthday 20 October, a week after OpenOffice.org celebrated its 8th. But the interesting
  point about NetBeans for OpenOffice.org developers is its integration with OpenOffice.org. With NetBeans, one can easily
  write extensions, and that's only a start. See:

  <p>In a similar light, the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> open-source framework also provides powerful
  tools for creating OpenOffice.org extensions. See:

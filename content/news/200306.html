      was held here June 26 and 27. It was an impressive first effort. Several
      local Free Software advocates felt the conference, which was held behind
      tight security in the Trinidad and Tobago Central Bank building, was too
      oriented toward officialdom. But was this bad? Officialdom was certainly
      there in force -- and was listening with open ears to the Free and Open
      Source message. ".</td>

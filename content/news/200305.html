    <td  class="alt9">Erin Joyce reports on Microsoft's efforts to make its Office
      more affordable by dropping the license cost. (There is no fee associated
      with OpenOffice.org usage.) As Joyce writes, "According to a research report
      from Deutsche Bank securities published Wednesday, the "blunt instrument" of
      pricing could be one of many ways Microsoft is expected to respond to the
      challenge Linux poses to its market dominance."</td>

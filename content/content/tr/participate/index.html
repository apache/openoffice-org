      <h2><a href="#why-get-involved-with-the-openoffice-project" id="why-get-involved-with-the-openoffice-project">Why get involved with the OpenOffice project?</a></h2>
<p>There are many motivations for why volunteers participate in an open source project like OpenOffice.  Some of the more common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help reduce the &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo; by ensuring continued access to free high-quality free productivity applications world-wide.</li>
<li>To help bring the benefits of OpenOffice to you country or region</li>
<li>To &ldquo;give back&rdquo; to open source</li>
<li>To learn or practice a new skill</li>
<li>To enhance a résumé or portfolio, showcasing the work you&rsquo;ve done in this project</li>
<li>To support a customer or other commercial venture that relies on OpenOffice</li>
<li>To develop credentials for consulting work related to OpenOffice</li>
<li>To bring something to OpenOffice that you&rsquo;ve always wanted to see done</li>
<li>To have fun, working with a close-knit international team of volunteers working on one of the oldest and most famous open source projects around.</li>
</ul>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to be a programmer to contribute to Apache OpenOffice. Our project involves a large range of different skills, levels of involvement and degrees of technical expertise. So, if you want to get involved in Apache OpenOffice, there is almost certainly a role for you.</p>
<p>We are looking for people to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write or update documentation</li>
<li>Help support new users</li>
<li>Test the program and report bugs</li>
<li>Fix bugs</li>
<li>Code new features</li>
<li>Design artwork and other marketing materials</li>
<li>Translate to different languages</li>
<li>Maintain the website and develop new materials</li>
<li>Promote OpenOffice and help explain its benefits</li>
<li>anything you can see that needs doing</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these contributions help to keep a project active and strengthen the community. We welcome and encourage participation, and try to make it as easy as possible for people to get involved.</p>
<h2><a href="#how-to-get-started" id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</a></h2>
<p>OpenOffice is a large, complex open source project, with a culture developed over many years as an independent project, combined with our experience at Apache.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Apache-style open source development then you might just jump in.  Subscribe to a relevant project <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/mailing-lists.html">mailing list</a> and introduce yourself.  We&rsquo;ll help you get started.</p>
<p>If, however, you are new to Apache, or want a more methodical approach to getting started, then we have a set of graduated <a href="http://openoffice.apache.org/orientation/index.html">New Volunteer Orientation Modules</a> designed for new volunteers that takes you through a number of background topics related to Apache OpenOffice and how we do things.</p>
<p>Which path you take is up to you and is a matter of personal preference.  You can even do both.</p>
<p>We also maintain a list of specific areas where we need volunteers on our <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/Help+Wanted">Help Wanted</a> page of the wiki.</p>
<p>If you are a student, looking to contribute to the project as part of your school work, please also see our <a href="/students.html">Advice for Students</a> page.</p>

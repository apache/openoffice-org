          Apache OpenOffice Advisory</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Windows Installer Execution of Arbitrary Code with 
              Elevated Privileges
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Version 1.0</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Announced October 11, 2016
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Description</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The Apache OpenOffice installer for Winodws contained a defective
          operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated
          privileges.
        </p>
        <p>The location in which the installer is run may have been 
            previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link
            library that the installer depends upon.  The counterfeit is
            operated instead because of a search path defect in the 
            installer.  The counterfeit will be operated under the
            administrative privileges of the OpenOffice installer,
            compromising the users's PC.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Severity: Medium</strong>
        </p>

        <p>There are no known exploits of this vulnerabilty.<br />
          A proof-of-concept demonstration exists.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Versions Affected</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          All Apache OpenOffice versions 4.1.2 and older are affected.<br />
          OpenOffice.org versions are also affected.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Mitigation</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Install Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 for the latest maintenance and
          cumulative security fixes.  Use the Apache OpenOffice 
          <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/download/">download page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Defenses and Work-Arounds</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are unable to update to 4.1.3, there are other precautions
          that can be taken.  These precausions are also recommended as protection against other software that may have the vulnerability.
          <br /><br />
          When executing .exe installers, ensure that the installer is in a file folder that has no other files but the installer .exe file.
          <br /><br />
          If an installer proposes a folder to extract the setup files
          into before the actual install, choose the name of a folder that is not in use.  Delete such a folder of setup files after the installation completes successfully.  To reinstall without 
          downloading again, preserve the installer .exe on private 
          removable storage.

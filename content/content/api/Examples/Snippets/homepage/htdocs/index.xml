                    <p>
                        <b>codesnippets.services.openoffice.org</b> or <b>openoffice.bestsolution.at</b> provides you a space where you can upload, search and review Code Snippets solving
                        Common OO-Programming task. Since long there has been the abstract definition how to submit "<a href="http://api.openoffice.org/SDK/snippets/index.html" target="_new">CodeSnippets</a>"
                        when a problem was solved with the help from the people on the mailing lists but there's never been time
                        to put these code snippets online.

                    <h3>How to contribute</h3>
                    <p>
                        Write CodeSnippets and sent them to me dev@api.openoffice.org. Maybe sometime I'll add a webform where
                        you can upload CodeSnippet yourself. You can get the DTD to create codesnippets <a href="/snippet.dtd">here</a>.

                    <h3>Snippet-Creator</h3>
                    <p>
                        There exists a openoffice-wizard to create Snippets fairly easily. Thanks to Paolo Montanovi. The Snippet-Creator could be
			found <a href="http://api.openoffice.org/SDK/snippets/SnippetCreator.zip" target="_new">here</a> and at <a href="http://www.paolo-mantovani.org/" target="_new">http://www.paolo-mantovani.org/</a>.<br/>
                        Installation is fairly easy using the pkgchk-utility.<br/>
                        On Linux:
                        <div class="codesnippet">
                            user@host:>$OO_HOME/pkgchk SnippetCreator.zip
                        </div>
                        <br/>On Windows:
                        <div class="codesnippet">
                            Open DOS-Window<br/>
                            $OO_HOME\pkgchk SnippetCreator.zip

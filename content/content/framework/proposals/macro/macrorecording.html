<H1 CLASS="western">Some thoughts about Macro Recording</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All StarOffice versions prior to the
release of OpenOffice.org had a macro recorder. This tool was able to
record actions of the user and translate them into StarBasic code. It
was removed before the OO.o source code was released. To understand
why it was removed and why it is so hard to create a replacement for
it, it's necessary to learn something about the way it worked and
about the internal command processing in OO.o applications.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The OO.o applications are based on the
SFX application framework. This framework is not an UNO based one,
it's pure C++. It's main operational area is the management of the
user interface and the processing of commands created by user
actions. Every functionality (functions, properties) provided by an
SFX based application component is described by a structure called
&bdquo;slot&ldquo;. It contains a number identifying the slot (the
&bdquo;slot id&ldquo;), some additional information for internal
processing inside SFX (some mostly boolean parameters describing the
slot), a name (its &bdquo;API name&ldquo;) and the information wether
this slot represents a function or a property. For functions it also
contains a list of all parameters and their names and types and the
type of the return value, for properties it contains the property
type.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All the slots and their properties are
known at compile time to the application module they belong to.
Inside the application modules the slots are grouped together into
data structures called &bdquo;(slot) interface&ldquo;. Every module
knows several interfaces, each of them representing a &bdquo;context&ldquo;
of the user interface. Examples are the contexts &bdquo;text
document&ldquo;, &bdquo;impress slide view&ldquo;, &bdquo;table
selection&ldquo;, each of them is represented by a corresponding slot
interface (or a group of them). The sum of all currently available
contextes (slot interfaces) defines the available feature set of an
SFX based application component.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The SFX application framework learns
about the slots by being dynamically bound to the modules and slot
interfaces at runtime. So it is able to browse through the whole
available feature set of the application component. All currently
bound slot interfaces are pushed on a stack provided by the SFX
framework, thus defining an ordering mechanism for them. Pushing
interfaces on the stack or removing interfaces from there is the way
context switches in the user interface are reflected in the SFX.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All user interface elements written for
the SFX (f.e. toolboxes, menus, keyboard shortcuts) don't call
directly into the application code, they just call a very generic SFX
based API to execute a slot. The slot is identified by its slot id
and the SFX framework is able to find the right code that is able to
process the slot by browsing through the bound slot interfaces in a
well defined manner, using the stack of slot interfaces mentioned
above. Many calls are executed without additional parameters, but
many others also pass parameters while executing the slot. An example
for the first case is a simple click on a menu entry. An example for
the second case is when the user changes some values in a dialog and
leaves the dialog by clicking its &bdquo;OK&ldquo; button. Here all
changed values in the dialog are sent as parameters of the slot
command.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The generic API assures that every
command goes through the same code in the SFX framework, and so this
framework is able to translate every slot execution into a single
StarBasic statement or a group of them, just by finding the slot
structure belonging to the slot being executed, the slot interface it
is belonging to, getting the slots' API name and identifying the
parameters. (In the user interface usually no return values are
processed.) Here a slot interface or a group of slot interfaces
represents an object, every slot is a method or a property of such
object. Both together form a StarBasic statement like &bdquo;Object.Method(
)&ldquo;.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Basic code generated this way used
the so called &bdquo;old&ldquo; SO-Basic API, that is not supported
anymore in OO.o and SO6, and it is not in any way related to the
&bdquo;real&ldquo; API of the OO.o/SO applications. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The slot based API is still used for
large parts of the internal command execution in OO.o (the
communication between  the application component and its user
interface), but it is not possible to translate it into any UNO based
API. To be honest, only a few slot calls will ever end up in calling
a UNO based API of the underlying application component.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is possible to transform every slot
command into a call for the generic UNO based &bdquo;dispatch API&ldquo;,
where every functionality is described by a command string (we call
them &bdquo;command URLs&ldquo;, because they use the form
&bdquo;scheme:scheme dependent part&ldquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This API uses a chain of objects
implementing the DispatchProvider service. If the first object in the
chain is asked for a Dispatch object for an arbitrary command, it
will check the command if it wants to handle it. If the check turns
out to be positive, a Dispatch object is returned that is able to
execute the command, otherwise the query is passed to the next chain
object etc. If a Dispatch object was found anywhere in the chain, 
the command is executed by calling the dispatch method of the
Dispatch object, where all parameters are passed as PropertyValue
structs.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The result of a transformation from SFX
slot execution to dispatch call is a call dispatching the command
&bdquo;<A HREF="slot:xxxx">slot:xxxx</A>&ldquo; (xxxx=slot id),
passing all necessary parameters as PropertyValues. Newer UI
components are using this API instead of the slot based SFX API, just
to have a UNO based interface to the application componnent and not a
C++ based one. The SFX framework provides some wrapper code to
translate between the slot based API and the dispatch framework for
all these newer UI components if they are used for a SFX based
application component.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But the dispatch API, though being UNO
based, is only of limited practical use, because these calls are just
textual representations of the binary slot data. If you want to write
a program that uses OO.o API to work on OO.o documents, the dispatch
API is definitely not the one you want to use (except in some special
cases, where the functionality is not accessible by other APIs). The
dispatch API is just thought as the generic programming interface for
a mostly generic UI code.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is possible to record macros just
for automation purposes using  the SFX or the dispatch API calls:
take the internal binary representation of the slot commands (or the
command URL and the parameters of the dispatch call), store it
anywhere and execute it afterwards by using a &bdquo;slot machine&ldquo;
(only evil thinking persons will misunderstood this name in this
context here ;-) ) or a &bdquo;dispatch machine&ldquo;. But usually a
macro macro recorder is wanted to offer more than only automation:
most people want to have created source code they can browse and
modify. And this is exactly what you can't get from the SFX. Many
(most?) user interactions in the OO.o applications are processed
without any single UNO call, so there is nothing you can &bdquo;record&ldquo;.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">So what do we need to have the &bdquo;macro
recording&ldquo; feature back?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">First, every slot execution (or
dispatch call) must be mapped to one or several API calls of the
objects they are working on. This is hard work enough, don't expect
this to happen in the near future.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">But even if you have got this made, you
will need something that translates the API calls made into source
code of any (scripting) language supporting UNO. This can't be a
built-in UNO feature, because you want only the &bdquo;top level&ldquo;
UNO calls to be recorded, not the subsequent calls, because you will
get them called anyway when executing the macro. Perhaps the &bdquo;top
level&ldquo; calls could marked as recordable by the (AFAIK currently
not accessible UNO context), but this looks &bdquo;hacky&ldquo; and
ugly to me.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I'd prefer an explicit solution, where
every dispatch provider object that returns a dispatch object will be
asked to record this call into one or several API statements, but I
don't have any clever ideas for that. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">So I'd appreciate any ideas from
anybody who wants to contribute to that. May be it turns out that the
&bdquo;UNO built in&ldquo; solution is not that hacky as it seems,
may be that there is something completely different that puts a new
light on the problem.

for the Use of an Apply Button in Dialogs</FONT></FONT></P>

<H1><B>Introduction</B></H1>
<H2><B>User Problem Being Addressed</B></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none">These guidelines
for the placement and functionality of a standard &quot;apply button
set&quot; in dialog boxes have been developed to facilitate the
process of finely adjusting objects within StarOffice /
OpenOffice.org documents. The benefit is that users will be able to
see their changes immediately reflected in the context of the
document while the dialog box is still open. Users frequently want to
make iterative changes to the selection, and if the dialog closes as
each change is made, it is inefficient to re-open the dialog multiple
times.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none">The &quot;Apply
button&quot; functionality was deemed as a necessary tool for the
medium-skill to advanced-skill user to avoid tedious command
repetitions and for efficiency. Because this functionality will
replace several other button sets, it is important that while it
helps with efficiency to the advanced user, it does not hinder novice
or cross-over users.</P>
<H2><B>Project Definition</B></H2>
<P>The proposed guidelines set standards for the placement of a
&quot;standard set of Apply buttons&quot; as well as the behavior of
each of the buttons in the set. Inclusion and exclusion principles
have been established to more clearly state when and when not to use
this functionality. It clearly states what buttons should be included
in the &quot;standard set of Apply buttons&quot;, what types of
dialog boxes they should be used with, and their location and
arrangement in those appropriate dialog boxes.</P>
<P>In addition to guidelines for the use of the standard set of apply
buttons, a non-exhaustive list of dialog boxes to which it might be
useful to add the standard set of apply buttons has been included -
these can be found in the Appendix. Dialog boxes in four modules of
StarOffice / Openoffice.org (Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw) were
examined to see whether they warranted the Apply functionality.
Because of the variation in conditions under which these buttons can
be used, some dialog boxes were verified individually. All of those
mentioned in this specification were found under the Format menus on
the main menu bar of StarOffice v5.2. There is some overlap from
module to module, but there are also dialog boxes that are
module-specific.</P>
<P>In summary, this report provides inclusion and exclusion
guidelines, button configuration and behavior guidelines, scenario
descriptions, and screen-shots of some of the dialog boxes that may
be affected by the implementation of this functionality.</P>
<H2><B>Related and Competitive Products</B></H2>
<P>StarOffice v5.2 used several variations of an Apply button without
any apparent standardization measures, and this functionality is not
new. Some examples of programs that have already implemented similar
functionality are: for Windows Display and Desktop Themes (Start -
Settings - Control Panel - Display/Desktop Themes); and for GNOME the
Panel Properties dialog. This dialog shows a button set with <SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">&quot;OK&quot;,
&quot;Apply&quot;, &quot;Close&quot;, &quot;Help&quot;, t</SPAN>hough
in the desktop's Control Center <SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">(Main
Menu Button - Programs - Settings - Desktop - Panel) </SPAN>you can
find a set with <SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">&quot;Try&quot;,
&quot;Revert&quot;, &quot;OK&quot;, and &quot;Cancel&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Note:</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Assign button that can be found in
several dialog boxes in StarOffice / OpenOffice.org Draw (i.e. Format
- 3D Graphics) is not dealt with in this HCI Specification. It is
suggested that when the behavior of those Assign buttons is identical
to that of the Apply button, the mouse-over tip for the assign button
be changed from &quot;Assign&quot; to &quot;Apply&quot; to avoid
confusion. Otherwise, the name of this command should be changed to
something less ambiguous.</P>
<H1><A NAME="Main"></A>Basic Functionality</H1>
<P>It is recommended that dialog boxes employ the standard set of
apply buttons: &quot;OK&quot;, &quot;Apply&quot;, &quot;Reset&quot;,
and &quot;Close&quot;. Because it is also useful to be able to find
contextual help from each of those dialog boxes, the standard button
set will also include a &quot;Help&quot; button. The buttons order
and layout can be seen in Figure 1.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="oarch.gif" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=517 HEIGHT=25 BORDER=0>
<BR><B>Figure 1:</B> This is what the button layout and order should
be for dialog boxes that require the standard set of apply buttons. 
</P>
<P>The buttons should be aligned along the bottom of the dialog boxes
in question and should be referred to as &quot;the standard set of
apply buttons&quot;. Their behavior is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a user clicks the OK button,
	the settings should be saved and the commands specified in the
	dialog box should be carried out. The dialog box should then be
	closed.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a user clicks the Apply
	button from the main dialog box, changes are applied to the selected
	object within the document, but the dialog box is not closed.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a user clicks the Reset
	button from the main dialog box, the settings in the dialog box are
	returned to their values as per the last Apply command. If the user
	has opened the dialog and has made changes but has not yet clicked
	the Apply button, the settings are returned to the values
	corresponding to when they first opened the dialog box. The Reset
	button does not close the dialog box. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a user makes changes to the
	values in the dialog box and clicks the Close button from the main
	dialog box without first clicking Apply, an alertbox like the one
	shown below should be displayed to allow them to continue without
	losing any information.</P>
	<LI><P>The Help button invokes the standard Help Tool window
	contextualized to the dialog box in question.</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="apply_alert.gif" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=105 BORDER=0></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><B>Figure 2:</B>
This is the alert-box that is displayed if a user clicks the Close
button and there are changed settings that have not yet been applied
to the document. </FONT>
</P>
<P>The wording of the text within the alert-box is modeled after
phrasing that is already used throughout StarOffice 5.2. It should
read: &quot;Settings have been modified. Do you want to apply your
changes?&quot; The alert-box is similar to that which appears when a
user attempts to close a document without saving its contents first.
The behavior of each button in this alert-box is as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a user clicks the Apply
	button in the alert-box, the changes they made to the values within
	the main dialog box will be applied to the selection in the
	document, and the dialog box is closed.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a user clicks the Discard
	button in the alert-box, the changes they made to the values within
	the main dialog box should <I>not</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
	be applied, and the dialog box should be closed.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P>When a user clicks the Cancel button in the alert-box, the
	alert-box should be closed but the changes should <I>not</I> be
	applied and the user should be returned to the main dialog box. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H2><B>Mouseless navigation</B></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Mouseless navigation and keyboard
traversal should work as in other StarOffice / OpenOffice.org dialog
boxes employing default buttons, mnemonics, and full keyboard access.</P>
<H2>Mnemonics</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For accessibility reasons, mnemonics
have been added to the Apply and Reset buttons. The Close button does
not require one because the Escape key defaults to Close in a dialog
box. The letters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;r&quot; have been chosen as
the mnemonics for Apply and Reset respectively. The letter &quot;h&quot;
will remain as the default for Help as is standard.</P>
<H2>&quot;Undo&quot; Command Protection</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">To ensure that users have a safety net,
they should always be allowed to undo commands that were invoked
through an Apply button in a dialog box. The current behavior in one
of the few modeless dialog box that currently (v5.2) contains an
Apply button (Insert - Hyperlink) is to undo each of the apply
commands individually, even if the selection has been changed. It is
suggested that modal dialog boxes follow this behavior as closely as
possible for the sake of consistency. This means that for both modal
and modeless dialog boxes the Undo command should only go as far back
as one Apply command, and not as far as all the Apply commands
invoked in the last instance of the dialog box.</P>
<H1>Guidelines</H1>
<H2>Inclusion Guidelines</H2>
<P>The &quot;standard set of apply buttons&quot; should be used ... :
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When it might be helpful to users
	to make iterative changes to a selection within a document without
	closing and re-opening the dialog box.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Even in instances where the dialog
	box presents the user with a preview of the changes in question.
	This allows the user to view the object's properties in the context
	of the document.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Exclusion Guidelines</H2>
<P>The &quot;standard set of apply buttons&quot; should <I>not</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
be used ... :</SPAN></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If the changes applied to the
	user's selection are not visibly noticeable. Dialog boxes that
	contain visibly confirmable changes <I>and</I> non-visibly
	confirmable changes may still use the apply button set, and should
	apply both sets of changes.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">If
	the changed settings will not immediately be reflected in the user's
	document.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">If
	the Apply command is in reference to an action that will occur
	within that specific dialog box. It should only be used when setting
	are transferred from a dialog box directly to a document.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In any dialog box that is accessed
	from within another dialog box (i.e. secondary, terciary, ... ).</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When the changes made in the
	dialog box are immediately reflected in the document, as in an
	inspector window.</P>
</UL>
<H2>Behavior Guidelines</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Apply and Reset buttons should
	be inactive(graye<SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">d out) when
	the user first opens a dialog box that contains the standard set of
	apply buttons. They should become active as soon as any of the
	values are changed in that dialog box. As soon as the Apply or Reset
	buttons are clicked, they should again revert to their greyed out
	condition.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">When
	a user clicks the Apply button in a dialog box containing multiple
	tabs, the settings in all tabs within that dialog box should be
	applied, not only those in the active window. To be consistent, when
	the Reset command is clicked, the settings in all tabs within that
	dialog box should be reset.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The Reset button (that returns
	settings to previously applied values) should not be confused for a
	defaults button (that returns settings to program defaults). Dialog
	boxes that need a Defaults button should present it separately from
	the standard set of apply buttons.</P>
</UL>
<H1>Open Issues</H1>
<H2>Button set</H2>
<P>The account of buttons should be reduced to a minimum as too much
buttons could be confusing for a user. Because of this two questions
came up:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>It is not clear if the Reset button should be an optional
	part of the button set. As there might be situations where an Apply
	button would be useful, but a Reset button would not make so much
	sense. An example are dialogs, where just some simple values are
	entered, e.g. for adjusting the row height of a table (see Format &#150;
	Row &#150; Height). The more complex the possible dialog settings
	are, the more useful a Reset button would be. Should the Apply
	button set always contain a Reset button?</P>
	<LI><P>Can we find another solution for the Help button, for example
	by replacing it with an icon? (As this also affects other dialogs,
	that won't have an Apply button, this will probably be an open issue
	for the future.)</P>
</UL>
<H2>Reset Button Behavior</H2>
<P>The Reset button's current behavior allows users to revert the
settings in the dialog box to their values as of the last Apply
command. As we see it, there are several options here:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Change the behavior of the Reset button to more of an Undo so
	that it reverts the settings back to the values at the invocation of
	the dialog box</P>
	<LI><P>Eliminate the Reset button altogether to eliminate clutter,
	still allowing the user to &quot;cancel&quot; their Apply commands
	using the Undo function</P>
	<LI><P>Leave the Reset button like it is.</P>
</OL>
<P>Again, there are other options that are listed here, but what is
the best solution?</P>

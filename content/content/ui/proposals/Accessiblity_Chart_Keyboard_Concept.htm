<h2>A Proposal for Keyboard Navigation in Charts</h2>

<a name="intro"><h3>1. Introduction</h3></a>

<p>For the chart to become accessible, it is necessary to do everything that you can do using the
mouse.  Especially selecting objects is a task that is currently not available.  Apart from
selection, the most important thing is access to menus and context-menus, which is already
accessible by keypresses.</p>

<a name="others"><h3>2. Other Applications</h3></a>

<h4>What MS Graph supports</h4>

<p>In MS Graph, you can cycle through all groups using the cursor up and down keys.  With cursor
left and right you can navigate through the objects in the current group.  At least this is what is
described in the Help.  The cursor left/right navigation not only travels throught the members of a
group but also reaches all top-level objects, that can also be selected with cursor up/down.  In my
opinion the navigation is not very intuitive; however, you can access all objects.</p>

<h4>What Draw/Impress supports or will support</h4>

<p>In Draw/Impress, you can travel through all top-level objects, or objects belonging to group
currently entered, by pressing Tab and Shift-Tab.  This is the same behaviour as in MS
PowerPoint.</p>

<p>With the cursor keys you can move objects by 1 millimeter into the respective direction.</p>

<p>You can enter a group by pressing F3 and leave it by pressing Ctrl-F3.</p>

<p>To edit text objects you can press F2 (which is a common key for text editing).</p>


<a name="proposal"><h3>3. Proposal</h3></a>

<p>To consistent with other OOo applications, I think it makes most sense to adapt the navigation
from the Draw application.  The usage of tabulator keys also has the advantage that the cursor keys
are available for moving objects which seems to be impossible in MS Graph so far.</p>

<p>To select a data point inside a series that is currently selected, you could enter a group by
pressing F3.  It may be not very intuitive, but it is consistent.  Therefore I suggest to adapt this
behaviour as well.</p>

<p>Internally the diagram (plot-area) is a group, which has to be entered to access the axes and the
series.  I suggest not to offer this structure directly to the outside, but instead treat the
diagram, the axes, and the series as being on the same level.  So you need the entering/leaving of
groups only for series and the legend.</p>

<p><table border>

 <tr><th>Key</th><th>Function</th><th>Valid for</th></tr>

 <tr><td>Tab</td><td>Select next object in current group.  After the last object, the first one is
 selected</td><td>All objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Shift-Tab</td><td>Select previous object in current group.  After the first object, the
 last object is selected.</td><td>All objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Home / End</td><td>Select first / last object in current group.</td><td>All objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Esc</td><td>Unselect all objects</td><td>All objects</td></tr>

 <tr><td>Cursor Keys</td><td>Move object in the respective direction</td><td>All objects that are not move
         protected, i.e., all top-level objects</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Cursor Keys</td><td>Move a pie segment in the direction of the cursor direction projected
         on the bisector of the segment</td><td>Pie segments in a pie chart</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td>F3</td><td>Enter a group.</td><td>Series, Legend</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Ctrl-F3</td><td>Leave a group.</td><td>Series, Legend</td></tr>

 <tr><td>F2</td><td>Edit text</td><td>Titles</td></tr>
 <tr><td>F4</td><td>Standard position/size dialog</td><td>Position for all top-level objects, size
 only for diagram</tr>

 <tr><td>+ / -</td><td>Resize diagram proportionally (enlarge/shrink)</td><td>Diagram</td></tr>
 <tr><td>+ / -</td><td>Drag pie segment out/in</td><td>Pie segments in a pie chart</td></tr>

</table></p>

<p>The cursor keys and + / - move / resize objects by 1mm.  If together with those keys the Alt-Key
is pressed, the objects are moved one pixel corresponding to the current view.  Dragging of pies,
drag five percent in standard mode, together with Alt one percent of the radius.</p>

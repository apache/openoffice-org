<h2 id="introduction"> Introduction </h2>

<!-- ************************ I N T R O D U C T I O N  *************************    -->
<p>OpenOffice.org is a fully featured office productivity suite available for
the most popular platforms. One aim of OpenOffice.org is to seamlessly
integrate into each platform's most popular desktops.</p>

<p>
One major desktop on Linux and Solaris is developed by the open source GNOME project.
The component model of the GNOME desktop is BONOBO, which is built on top of
ORBIT, an open source CORBA ORB (Object Request Broker).
</p>

<p>
To be able to communicate with the GNOME desktop, we want to develop a CORBA-UNO bridge
using IIOP (<em>Internet inter orb protocol</em>). 

<h4> Goals for the bridge </h4>
The <strong>main goal</strong> is to get a CORBA-bridge that supports all features
necessary to communicate with
the GNOME desktop. This would e.g. allow to script OpenOffice.org from a GNOME scripting language.
As a <strong>secondary goal</strong> an arbitrary CORBA-ORB should be able to directly access
OpenOffice.org using the same bridge (for example on windows). This would allow to integrate
OpenOffice.org seamlessly into any CORBA environment.

<p> However, bridging UNO and CORBA is a non trivial task, as both component
models
are based on <a href="../comparison_uno_corba.html">different fundamental concepts</a>.
This document should provide concepts about how to cope with most of these
fundamental differences. It is supposed to grow within the next weeks as
documentation either during and after development of the bridge. It should be a kind of an
<em>open document</em>, as that important points brought up by the community will be
inserted here.
</p>

<h4>What exactly can be done with a CORBA-UNO bridge?</h4>

<p>
An UNO-CORBA bridge allows to e.g. call methods at an UNO object (let's say a writer document)
from the BONOBO object model. The caller does not need to know he is calling an UNO object,
the only thing he does is invoking a method on a CORBA interface. It is not needed for the
caller to have any UNO libraries in process nor is it needed for the callee to have any
orbit libraries in process.
</p>

<p>
The other way round, the bridge allows an UNO programmer to call CORBA objects from UNO. The
UNO programmer does not have to have any special CORBA knowledge, he simply calls on
UNO interfaces.
</p>

<p> To support callback interfaces, it should be possible to implement CORBA-interfaces in
UNO and vice versa.

<h4><a name="corba_access">Accessing UNO processes from CORBA and vice versa</a></h4>

<p>The main problem of accessing an object in a different process is that you
   need the IOR (Interoperable Object Reference) of this object in the other
   process. The most common way is to have a daemon like process (typically a
   namingservice or a implementation repository) that administrates IORs.
   Every CORBA application can access this daemon to retrieve an IOR of the
   desired object.</p>

<p>The root IOR of this daemon process must somehow be brought to every single
   application. How this is done, is orb dependent (possible solutions are a
   certain file on the filesystem, configuration files, environment variables,
   command line parameters, etc).</p>

<p>The mechanism how to access this IOR should be made abstract to allow to
   implement a different mechanism for different orbs. A simple interface as
   following one should be sufficient.</p>

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%"  >
<tr>
<td COLSPAN="3" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFC0">
<pre>
      interface XRootIORProvider
      {
        /** tries to locate a corba root object using a specified method.

		Note : In general, no CORBA bridge needs to be instantiated.
		       This IOR can be retrieved by some other mechanism.
		       
	   @param howToFindObject
	          format: kind of service to find, comma separated attribute 
		      list e.g. "GnomeResolverFromX,display=jbu-11096:1" or 
			  similar.
			  
	   @return stringified IOR, if a namingservice could be found, 
		      otherwise an empty string.
	 */	   
	 string findRootIOR( string howToFindObject );
      };
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>returned stringified IOR can later be used to create an UNO interface
   reference to the object. Therefor will exist an CORBA bridge interface with
   a method</p>

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%"  >
<tr>
<td COLSPAN="3" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFC0">
<pre>     
     interface XCorbaBridge
     {
	[...]
	Any resolveByStringifiedIOR( string sIOR );
	[...]
     };
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The returned Any contains an UNO interface reference. This can be used to
   directly make calls.</p>
     
     <ul>
     <li><p>The gnome case (ORBIT)</p>
       <p>Up to version 1.3, GNOME uses the gnorba framework. From version 1.4 (yet to come)
	  on, the oaf (object activation framework) is used. However, as this bridge is
	  also in a early development cycle, we will focus on the more powerful oaf-framework.

	  <p> Oaf is a mix of an implementation repository and the CORBA trading service.
	  Certain services can be advertised using properties (name-value pairs). Services
	  can be accessed by doing queries on properties. Accessing a service can either
	  result in starting a new process or simply returning the object reference
	  of an existing instance. Services can either be described within ini-files
	  or can be inserted at runtime (e.g. when a service starts up, it inserts itself
	  in the oaf). 
	  	  
	  <p>
	  The suggested way to use the oaf is to link against the oaf C-library and use
	  C-API functions. However the oaf offers most of its functionality via
	  idl-interfaces (e.g. in process shared library services can not be instantiated 
	  via the idl-interface).

	  <p>
	  IMHO the best way to access oaf would be to implement an RootIORProvider service,
	  that implements the XRootIORProvider interface. The service may be started in
	  a separate process, if needed.
	  The implementation is linked linked against liboaf.so and uses the C-API to retrieve
	  the stringified IOR of the root object. The original process then instantiates
	  a CORBA bridge and tries to access it using the resolveByStringifiedIOR() method (without
	  using the interface intermediate process anymore).

	  <p> The service may later become simpler, if the IOR can be retrieved via a command
	  line tool or a environment variable.
	   
     <li> other CORBA orbs
          [...]
     </ul>
    <p>
     So far the problem, how OpenOffice.org can access CORBA services, is solved. But what is
     the other way round? How can we get the OpenOffice.org servicemanager into the oaf? There
     are multiple possible solutions.

     </p>
     <ol>
     <li><p>Insert the UNO servicemanager IOR into oaf at Office startup.
          This works fine as long as the office is running.
		  </p></li>

     <li><p>
     Add oafinfo-files to the oaf, so that the oaf itself can start the office, if
     needed. The office must then behave like an arbitrary GNOME service, interpret
     command-line parameters and use the  oaf-library to do some non-corba-communication
     with the oaf. It still needs to be investigated, if this has any problems.
	 </p></li>

     <li><p>
     (and in my eyes the CORBA way to do it) Have our own UNO daemon,
     that itself works as implementation repository for UNO services (such as the office).
     The office servicemanager is configured in the oaf simply by a persistent
     stringified IOR, but uses the host/port entries of the UNO daemon. When someone
     tries to make a call on the object, the UNO daemon starts up the office
     and replies a LOCATION_FORWARD iiop-message with the appropriate host/port entries. To allow
     this , ORBIT must support LOCATION_FORWARD messages (does it?).
	 </p></li>

     <li><p>
     Have a UNO daemon, that runs continuously. It implements
     the oaf OAF::ObjectDirectory interface and inserts it into the running oaf.
     It starts the office on demand using the office-specific command line parameters.
	 </p></li>
     </ol>

          <p>
     Which solution will be used is not yet determined.

<h4><a name="oneway">Oneway calls</a></h4>
<p>
CORBA does not guarantee the sequence of calls for oneways. However,
a lot of UNO interfaces and implementations rely on that (think of the sequence
<code> acquire(),acquire(),release()</code> gets mixed up to
<code> acquire(),release(),acquire()</code>, this would be fatal).
So I think, it is inevitable to
export all UNO-oneway-methods as synchronous to CORBA.

<p> Oneway with CORBA interfaces however should be supported, as there it must have been
decided during design, that the series of calls is not important.

<p> Is a special solution for
    GNOME possible (maybe the implementation guarantees the sequence of calls)?
    
     
<h4><a name="object_lifetime">Object lifetime</a></h4>

Several use cases must be taken into account when talking about object lifetime.

<ol>
<li> CORBA object implementing an CORBA-interface used from UNO <br/>
The interface-definition
is imported from CORBA to be accessible for the UNO runtime. The interface is flagged as
being a CORBA interface. For the UNO runtime, the interface is derived from
<code>XInterface</code>.

<p>
The UNO-CORBA bridge must create a proxy within the UNO process, it must implement
<code>acquire()</code>, <code>release()</code> and <code>queryInterface()</code>. As the
interface does not support a queryInterface method, it must be dummy-implemented, so that it
supports a query for the interface and all its superclasses.

<p> The lifetime of the proxy bears no problem, it is simply refcounted. If the refcount drops
to zero, the proxy dies silently, no message is transported to the original object.

<li> CORBA object implementing a UNO-interface used from UNO <br/>
The UNO interface-definition must be imported into the CORBA typelibrary and stub/proxy-code
must be generated for the CORBA-process.
The object must implement itself <code>acquire()</code>, <code>release()</code>
and <code>queryInterface()</code> and maybe <code>getCorbaID()</code>
(see <a href="#object_identity">below</a>).

<p> Here the lifetime problem becomes a little difficult. Let us first have a look at
lifetime handling in a UNO-UNO interprocess-bridge.</p>
<img src="../images/passing_interface_reference_uno_uno.jpg" alt="Uno interface" />

<p>
The <code>pass()</code> call shall pass an interface reference as its first argument. The
UNO-UNO bridge acquires the object on caller side, the bridge on callee side knows, that
it gets an acquired interface.

<p>
This cannot be done with a general CORBA orb, because the orb runtime doesn't know,
that it should call acquire implicitly. How can this be solved? In general,
the callee must acquire the interface, when it wants to keep it.
The UNO-CORBA bridge would acquire it in advance and release it again when
the newly created proxy is destroyed. Thus the UNO-developer wouldn't need to do
anything by hand.

<p>
<img src="../images/passing_interface_reference_corba_uno.jpg" alt="Corba uno interface"/>
<p>
This does  NOT WORK FOR ONEWAY CALLS. This technique
may also be inefficient, because every mapped interface requires a (maybe synchronous)
<code>acquire()</code> call. However, as GNOME does refcounting this way, the UNO-CORBA
bridge will also do it this way thus ignoring the problem.

<p>
<b> Acquire in advance</b><br/>
Another possibility would be to make the CORBA developer responsible for this, if
he passes a object-reference, he must call <code>acquire</code> in advance. This is 
very error prone (think about any, structs and sequences, that all would need to be
parsed for object references), however this is the only way how oneway requests
can pass object references. This could be introduced only for oneway calls, but as
in general it cannot be seen from the method signature, whether a call is oneway or
synchronous, this would be very confusing.
<p>
<img src="../images/passing_interface_reference_acquire_in_advance.jpg" alt="reference interface"/>

<p>
Another solution would be to simply ignore <code>acquire()</code> and <code>release()</code>,
but how shall the CORBA side then get to know, when an instance can be discarded, as the
OpenOffice.org API is not designed for telling the objects something like this?

<li> UNO object implementing a CORBA-interface used from CORBA <br/>
The CORBA-interface is derived from <code>XInterface</code> in the UNO process. So for the
object itself, the lifetime must be controlled via <code>acquire()</code> and
<code>release()</code> calls.

<p>
The problem is, that when the UNO-object is once mapped out to a CORBA process, the
UNO-CORBA-bridge must hold a reference to the object and does not know, when to release it.
(The CORBA developer does not see the <code>acquire()</code> and <code>release()</code>
methods).

<p>
Often, CORBA interfaces are somehow designed to control lifetime of objects. For example,
an object has an explicit <code>destroy()</code> method, on which the documentation states
that the instance is destroyed and the object becomes unreachable. However the bridge
can't read documentation ( :o) ), so there must be mechanism, that the implementation
can tell the bridge, that it does not need to be held anymore.

<p> As the implementation naturally does not know the bridge instance, there
should be implemented
a broadcast/listener mechanism to broadcast this message to all CORBA bridge instances.
There could be a singleton service, that knows all CORBA bridges (maybe a factory,
that creates all CORBA bridges.)</p>

<br/>
<li> UNO object implementing a UNO interface used from CORBA
   Here the CORBA developer sees the <code>acquire()</code>, <code>release()</code>,
   <code>queryInterface()</code> and <code>getCorbaID()</code> method. Because the
   CORBA runtime does not support <code>acquire()</code> directly, the CORBA developer
   must call <code>acquire()</code> and <code>release()</code> by hand.

   <p>
   Interface references returned by a method (as return value or out-parameter) are
   supposed to be acquired, thus if the references must be
   released by the CORBA programmer, if not needed anymore.
   This means, that a CORBA programmer who implements
   a UNO-interface methods, that returns an interface reference (via return value or
   out-parameter) must acquire the interface beforehand. 


</ol>

<h4><a name="thread_identity">Thread identity</a></h4>
   UNO interprocess bridges preserve thread identity, that means when process A calls
   process B and in the same request process B calls again process A, the same thread
   waiting in process A will take over the new request. This ensures that thread
   local resources (locked mutexes, thread local storage, etc.) are preserved.

<p>
   An arbitrary CORBA orb may not support thread identity. The id can be inserted into
   the service context list. If the CORBA process supports it, it is fine, if not
   thread identity cannot be preserved, this could result in deadlocks.

<p>
   The service context id <em>LogicalThreadId</em> can be reused, that was original
   designed for DCOM interoperability. An appropriate ID for this should be applied at
   the omg.
</p>

<h4><a name="object_identity">Object identity</a></h4>
<p>CORBA does not guarantee object identity , but several UNO interfaces
   (especially container and broadcaster/listener interfaces) rely on that.  I
   would like to introduce a typical example, where such a problem occurs.</p>

<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%"  >
<tr>
<td COLSPAN="3" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFC0">
<pre>
interface XListener :  XInterface
{
...
};

interface XBroadcaster : XInterface
{
   void addListener( [in] XListener listener );
   void removeListener( [in] XListener listener );
}
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The XBroadcaster interface is implemented by the UNO object U (in the UNO
   process), the XListener interface is implemented by the CORBA object C  in
   the CORBA process.  Now there is an actor, that wants to add C into U and
   later remove C from U.</p>

     <p>
     Adding is no problem, but removing is. The CORBA bridge in the UNO process must know,
     that the reference passed with the removeListener() method, is the same, that was
     passed with the addListener() method. However, it can't know for sure just by seeing
     the object reference, because in CORBA it is possible, that two object references
     denote one object.

     <p> The problem is even worse, because the removal may work most of the time
     (object references passed by add/remove are identical),
     but sometimes not.

     <p> Note, that the check for object identity in UNO is done by comparing the
         pointer of the XInterface proxy. So a UNO-CORBA bridge must ensure,
	 that interfaces belonging to the same object get the same proxy. This must be
	 done for every interface reference, because the bridge does not know in advance,
	 if there will be a check for object identity.

     <p>
     Possible solutions for this problem are :

     <ol>
	 <li><p>Leave the problem of the object identity to the CORBA developer.
	      The UNO-base interface XInterface gets a new method in CORBA :</p>
<table BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="100%">
<tr>
<td COLSPAN="3" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#FFFFC0">

	The ID must be globally unique, e.g. a GUID.
      */
      sequence< byte > getCorbaID();
};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
	<p>Every time, an object is mapped from CORBA to UNO, the UNO-CORBA bridge
	checks, if it knows
	the reference already. If it is new, it calls getCorbaID() at the object.
	In case, the bridge knows the object already, the existing proxy is
	used, so that object identity is guaranteed.
	</p>

	<p>This works (as long as a unique id is provided), but it may be
	   excruciatingly slow for some applications (for every newly mapped
	   interface, 1 remote call is necessary, think of a sequence&lt;
	   XInterface &gt; with 100 elements, and you know what I mean :o) ).  This
	   is also a burden for the CORBA developer.</p>

	<p> There are three solutions, to avoid the performance problem 

	<ol>
	<li><p>
	The UNO-CORBA bridge
	itself exports the interface XRemoteCorbaBridge interface (how can it be offered

</table>
	<p>(The second associateInstanceWithId call is not necessary, when the same
	reference is used).</p>

	<p>One advantage of this solution is, that the CORBA developer must only
	care for the problem, where performance is needed, but it looks quite
	ugly.</p>

	<p>Because CORBA does not guarantee the series of oneway calls, it is not certain
	, that this will work as expected (but quite likely for most ORB implementations).

	</p></li>

	<li><p>The orb could be modified, that it inserts into the IOR a special
	profile
	which includes the object identifier. Such a profile must be specified and a
	tag must be applied at the omg.</p></li>

		<p>The XBroadcasterProxy implementation is connected to the
		XBroadcaster implementation somehow before (it may be a separate
		service). The XBroadcasterProxy.addListener implementation adds
		XListener-Proxies to the XBroadcaster implementation and stores a hash
		id, which is returned to the original actor. This actor can later
		remove the interface at the XBroadcasterProxy implementation using the
		returned id.</p>

	<p>
	The broadcaster proxy must certainly be implemented generically, so that it
	can be reused as often as possible.
	
	<p>
	This works in the concrete example, but does not solve all problems.
	If the interface reference of C is passed to an object in the UNO process,
	and this object inserts it into a container, the same problem may occur.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All CORBA interfaces seem to be derived from XInterface in the UNO

<li><p>All CORBA interfaces derived from <code>GNOME::Unknown</code> appear in
UNO only as derived from <code>com::sun::star::uno::XInterface</code>, the
<code>GNOME::Unknown</code> interface does not appear. The typelibrary needs to
be extended, so that the CORBA-UNO bridge can identify, that the GNOME::Unknown
interface is the real base interface.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="multiple_inheritance">Multiple inheritance</a></h4>
Multiple inheritance will not be supported in the first version of the UNO-CORBA bridge.

<h4><a name="type_information">Type information</a></h4>
<p>Both processes (UNO and CORBA) must have the same type information
available.  In UNO, these types must be accessible via the typelibary. The
CORBA-UNO bridge will generically marshal these calls without the need of
generated code. On CORBA side, there must be (in general) libraries of
generated stub/proxy code available.</p>
</ol>

<h4><a name="object_identifier">Object identifier</a></h4>
     What object identifiers get incoming CORBA objects within UNO and what
     object ids get outgoing UNO objects?
     <p>
     As there is currently no better proposal for the
     <a href="#object_identity">object identity problem</a>, we assume that
     solution 1. is chosen.

     <p>
     First the mapping of UNO objects to CORBA is discussed. Below you find a typical example of
     an UNO object implementing multiple interfaces.
     <p>
    
     <img src="../images/pipe_inheritance.gif" alt="Pipe inheritance"/>

     <p>
     The Pipe object is instantiated in the UNO process and is passed
     as an XInterface reference to the CORBA-process. 

     <p>
     In CORBA, object references contain the most derived type and (beside other things)
     an unique object identifier. 
     A request can be invoked by sending the unique
     object identifier (and thus leaving out the type information). As there is no
     most derived type in UNO, the UNO-CORBA
     bridge must be able to extract solely from the object identifier, which object and
     which interface the request is meant for.

     <p>
     The bridge could use the UNO object identifier and try to find out by the
     method name, which interface shall be called on.
     But this would mean that it is not possible to have two methods with the same
     name in two different interfaces.

     <p>
     So the UNO-CORBA bridge should use the UNO object identifier as an prefix and adds a type
     identifier. The type identifier may either be the complete type name or a single byte
     (the bridge ensures the byte's uniqueness for every single object ).
     <p>

     So in the above example, if the UNO object identifier is &quot;leo&quot;, the CORBA
     object identifier could be

     <table>
     <tr><th>Object ID</th><th>type name</th></tr>
     <tr><td>leo0</td><td><code>XInterface</code></td></tr>
     <tr><td>leo1</td><td><code>XInputStream</code></td></tr>
     <tr><td>leo2</td><td><code>XOutputStream</code></td></tr>
     </table>

	<p>For persistent object references, the name given to the object when
	 inserting it into the bridge is used (Note that this will only be done for
	 the exact type, other interfaces of the persistent object will have
	 transient ids), so for persistent references, there is no type suffix.</p>

<p>
     Now the mapping of CORBA objects to UNO is discussed. If an CORBA object implements UNO
     interfaces, the object must implement a <code>getCorbaId()</code> method.
     The bridge calls this method and uses the return value as unique object identifier.

     <p>
     For CORBA objects implementing CORBA interfaces, the bridge itself must generate an object
     identifier. It may happen that the same object gets different object identifiers, because
     the CORBA-UNO bridge has no possibility get the id of the object. So object identity for
     these objects will not work in UNO. However, the bridge must ensure, that an identifier
     is unique, therefor it is not sufficient to use the CORBA object identifier (two
     different CORBA processes  may use the same identifier). Therefor an connection dependent
     prefix is added to the object identifier (maybe a GUID generated for every connection).

     
<h4><a name="corba_bridge_service"> CorbaBridge service</a></h4>
     The CorbaBridge service is the interface between the UNO developer and the
     core bridge. In general, this service is used at startup and shutdown
     of the bridge.

     <p>
     What does the bridge need?
  
     <ul>
     <li><p>Port and host, that shall be inserted in outgoing TRANSIENT
          object references.</p></li>
     <li><p>Port and host, that shall be inserted in outgoing PERSISTENT
          object references. Here the host/port number of an implementation
          repository may be entered.</p></li>
     <li><p>Port and host, that the shall be listened to. There may be multiple
		  host/port combinations. Note that in outgoing object references only
		  one host/port can be inserted ! If you want two different hosts/ports
		  on two different transient object references, you need two instances
		  of a CORBA bridge.</p></li>
	 <li><p>Access to acceptor and connector services, that allow the bridge to
		  accept incoming connections and to establish outgoing connections, if
		  needed.</p></li>
	 <li><p>Objects, that shall be mapped persistently.  It should be possible
		  to make object references persistent. Persistent object references
		  stay the same even if the server process is restarted. To achieve
		  this, the bridge must know the objects before accepting calls. This
		  is for two reasons : If an incoming request to such an object comes
		  in, the bridge must know, where to delegate it. If the persistent
		  object is mapped, it must marshal the persistent reference instead of
		  the transient one.</p></li>
     </ul>

	 <p>Below you can find a first possible draft of the interface. No error
	 handling yet specified.</p>

<h4><a name="connection_management">Interprocess connection management</a></h4>
   A normal UNO-UNO interprocess bridge just owns one interprocess connection. This
   is not appropriate for the UNO-CORBA bridge, because interface references handed out
   over one connection can come in again over a different connection and must still be
   valid, so all connections must end in one bridge.
<p>
   The UNO-CORBA bridge needs to distinct between connections initiated from
   the UNO process or from an arbitrary CORBA process. If a request shall be invoked
   on a object, that has not been invoked before, the IOR must be parsed for a
   host/port combination. The bridge has a hashmap for actively initiated
   connections. The key is host/port and the connection is the value.
<p>
   If there is no match, the bridge tries to initiate a connection. On success,
   the connection is added to the hashmap. The proxy should store that it got
   the object last time over this connection for performance reasons.

<p>
   Actively initiated connections can be closed at any time. This should
   be done, when the last proxy, that uses this connection, dies.

<p>
   Passively initiated connections should be closed by the remote process. Another
   possibility would be to close it when the last stub for this connection dies, however
   then a CloseConnection message must be sent.
   
<p>   
   Bidirectional communication (as specified by GIOP 1.2) should be ignored in the
   first run, because it complicates things a lot.
   
<h4><a name="iiop_version">IIOP versions</a></h4>
   I think IIOP versions 1.0 is sufficient for the first running ORB. The following features
   are added in the following versions :

   <ul>
   <li> Version 1.1
    <ul>
      <li><p>Fragmentation messages</p></li>
	</ul>
   </li>
   <li> Version 1.2
    <ul>
       <li><p>Bidirectional communication over one connection</p></li>
	</ul>
   </li>
   </ul>
   
In the first run, only version 1.0 should be supported. Keeping the versions
1.1 and 1.2 in mind during implementation, it should be quite easy to implement
them later if needed.

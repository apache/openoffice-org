Project</a> Lead</span></td></tr>
<tr><td><p style="font-style: italic;">This
session is open to MarCons and other interested and active members
of the Marketing Project.
</p><p>If you are planning to attend, please come prepared
to share with
others your experience of marketing OOo in the last twelve months.
Tell us the things that worked well for you, and the things that did
not :-)
Please bring along any examples of marketing collateral you have
produced
(flyers, posters, newspaper / magazine articles...).
</p><p>Looking at <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Strategic_Marketing_Plan#Marketing_Project">our
organisation</a>,
there will be a discussion on the most effective way to organise
the project going forward. Is our present MarCon based structure the
best one? if so, how can
we find and empower good MarCons - what support do they need from the
wider community?
How do MarCons fit in with the work of Native-Language Projects?
</p><p>On the campaigns side, how well has the 'Why?'
campaign worked for you?
Please
bring your suggestions for more counter-marketing activities like <a href="http://why.openoffice.org/getlegal.html">"Get Legal"</a>
and <a href="http://why.openoffice.org/keepthecar.html">"Keep
the Car"</a>.
</p><p>If there's time, we'll also have a very quick look
at the <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Strategic_Marketing_Plan">Marketing
Strategy</a>.
Is it still valid? In particular, are the target markets still the
right ones?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="monday.html">Back</a><br />

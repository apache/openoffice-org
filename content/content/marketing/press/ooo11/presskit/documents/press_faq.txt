* OpenOffice.org 1.1 is cross platform and multi-lingual 



7) Is this announcement part of a larger strategy?
==================================================

* to grow the user- and developer-base for OpenOffice.org
* to increase the market share of non-Microsoft platforms
  in order to reinvigorate competition in the office
  productivity space



8) How does this news help the user/developer/customer?
=======================================================

Less training with even greater productivity. Access to office suite
software with no licence fees and no time-consuming license management
requirements.


9) Why would users care?
========================

There may be no other office suite software available with
character-set, menus, help and spelling dictionaries in their first
language.

All users can now download an office suite for no charge that is
extemely stable on their operating system platform and gain unmatched
productivity with equal or less training than it takes to upgrade to a
new version of the leading proprietary office suite.

Users and their organizations will enter a new open and well supported
office suite arena where they will never again worry about support or
file format continuity being broken by their software vendor.

Cost and prodictivity savings are beyond estimation.


10) What are some of the specific differentiators?
==================================================

Users and systems administrators can use different operating systems
in-house and still have all documents created and stored in a single
future-proof XML file format where fine-granular content within
documents is finely searchable and extendable to the Web.

An OOo document's native XML file format allows content to be accessed,
managed and extended OUTSIDE the office suite application, for example,
with viewing, editing and transmitting file content with small hand-held
devices and PDA's. Despite the open file format confidential docuemnts
can be password protected which includes a 128-bit encryption of the
content.

OOo has many language versions of the software in developent, some of
which are typically not supported by traditional office suites, e.g.
Zulu, Sotho and Afrikaans in South Africa. As a consequence 
OpenOffice.org will be available to many more users around the world
in their first language.

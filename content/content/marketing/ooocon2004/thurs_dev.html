					<td><p>In the year since the last conference, the project has only attracted a small number
					of new developers.  One of the barriers that prospective new developers face is to try and
					build OOo for the first time.</p>

					<p>Although precompiled solver tarballs can help those who do not want to compile the complete
					suite, the time it takes to download a solver puts many people off.  These problems will get
					worse as the OOo project continues to grow.</p>

					<p>In this session we will look at ways in which we can reduce the amount of time that developers
					and translators need to spend on their build environment instead of being productive, such as
					precompiled tools, providing library development packages and separating translations and
					other resources from the source code directories.</p>

					<td><p>OpenOffice.org KDE Integration Project aims to provide tight (but optional) integration of the
					OpenOffice.org to the KDE environment beginning with KDE look and feel and ending with KDE data
					sources.</p>

					<p>The project can be divided into its visible and its core part. The visible part includes the KDE-like look
					and feel, dialogs, etc., the core part focuses on the infrastructure needed for the visible part, and on
					the KDE data sources. Some of the work (mainly the visible part) is already available as patches to
					the current OpenOffice.org 1.1.x, other (most of the core part) focuses on the upcoming OOo 2.0.
					The most important subprojects are:</p>

					<p>Visible:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>"KDE Native Widget Framework" provides the OOo with the look of the
						theme that the user chose for his KDE desktop. The framework uses the QStyle
						API to draw its widgets the same way a real KDE/Qt application would.
						<li>"KDE Icons for OOo" replaces the OOo icons with the default KDE icons (CrystalSVG).
						<li>"cuckooo" allows OOo to be embedded in the Konqueror window as a read-only KPart
						so that people could browse to documents recognized by OOo which would open directly
						in the browser.
						<li>"KDE File Dialog" replaces the default OOo file dialog with the KDE one. This is
						work in progress.
					</ul>

					<p>Core:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>"KDE vclplug" has the goal to get OOo controlled by Qt events and drawn by Qt painting
						methods instead of pure X calls when running in KDE. It is developed for OOo 2.0 and is still
						quite experimental.
						<li>"KIO for OOo" is planned to use the KDE's virtual file system library KIO. The work did
						not start yet.
					</ul>

					<p>This talk will describe the background of the subprojects, and compare the plain OOo with
					the KDEized one. It will also discuss the current status and the future plans.</p>

					<li>working together with OpenOffice.org port contributors

					<li>Statistics about the QA team
					<li>Statistics about OpenOffice.org (IssueTracker statistics)
					<li>About IssueTracker keywords
					<li>writing and using testplans
					<li>Releases
					<li>Developer Builds
					<li>QA events (bug day events, discussion about timezones, using IRC)
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
					The second part gives an introduction in Automated GUI Testing.
					"How can the new port be tested" is often the first question
					after a successful build. 
					The 'qa/qatesttool'- project is using the TestTool binary with
					its own environment to test the "front side" - the GUI - of OOo
					on many platforms.<br>
					This part of the session describes how and where to start
					with automated [GUI] testing of OOo. Using the
					'TestTool Environment' is simple but writing own
					testcases is also easy with littlet BASIC skills and some
					knowledge about the 'TestTool Environment'.

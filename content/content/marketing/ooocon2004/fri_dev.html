						<p>To that end, we start with a short history of OOo from it's beginnings in Oct 2000 to
						the OOo 2.0 release, currently planned for Spring 2005, and observe a release cycle of
						approximately 18 months.</p>
						<p>Though this release cycle diverts from the classical open source "Release Early and Often"
						principle, we still see overlapping development and release cycles, and "continuous" feature
						increments.</p>
						<p>Based on a development model of "Child Workspaces" and "Master Workspaces", we currently
						deliver quarterly (bug fix) Updates of "Current Release" (1.1.x) and bi-weekly (feature)
						Milestones of "Next Release" (2.0).</p>
						<p>As this development model could also support shorter (feature) release cycles, provided
						obvious challenges (planning and organizing the many workspaces) can be addressed, we already
						seem to have an answer to the question of "How could we (technically) release early and often?".</p>
						<p>But, apparent limitations of short release cycles (user expectations on minimum feature
						increments, the "it's done when it's done" principle), lead to the more fundamental question
						of "How can we best account for the needs of all stakeholders in OOo?".</p>

					The current text-file based process is quite cumbersome, inelegant, confusing, and not conducive
					to internationalization efforts either. </p>

					<p>To attract new developers and make current developer's jobs easier, OpenOffice.org should
					gradually transition to graphical user-interface layout tools, and a layout-based window/widget
					display system. While this might sound boring, these changes have the potential to make
					OpenOffice.org much more exciting for developers and lower the bar for newcomers. The paper
					will touch on the current resource-based system, the reasons for proposing a new UI layout system,
					and possible implementation strategies. Part of the session should be reserved for discussions
					of a more technical nature.</p>

					product integration into the specific operating system.</p>
						<p>This session will give an overview about the new packaging process for OpenOffice.org 2.0.
						It contains the platform independent installationset description language, the setup script
						that contains a platform specific product description and the new tooling that creates the
						native installation sets based on the information in the setup scripts. The new process also
						includes the free software ESP Package Manager (ESP = Easy Software Products) that supports the
						creation of many different native installers and uses its own platform independent
						installationset description format. The results of the complete new process are for example
						Windows Installer installation sets for the Windows platforms, Solaris packages for the Solaris
						platform or RPMs for Linux.</p>
						<p>This talk will also give an overlook about the current support of the different operating
						systems and the possibilities for operating systems that are not yet supported.</p>

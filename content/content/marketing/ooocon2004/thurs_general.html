					aims at introducing, analysing, and supporting the use of Open Data Standards and Open Source
					software for personal productivity and document management in the Public Administration. COSPA
					will perform pilot projects throughout many European Public Administrations for benchmarking and
					analysing costs and benefits of migrations to Open Source Software. In particular, the project focuses
					on OpenOffice.org as the main personal productivity suite. COSPA is funded with 2,6 million euro by
					the 6th Framework Programme of the European Union and runs from January 2004 to December 2005.

					for a huge amount of companies all over the world. It provides a real chance for lower total
					cost of ownership for large scaled companies. On the other hand there are a lot of risks
					in the migration path, which should be covered by a clear and straight forward methodology.</p>

					<p>It starts in the decision process for the migration to StarOffice/OpenOffice.org itself, where tremendous
					faults could be made, and it does not end in the right user education after the launch of a new
					office package. </p>

					<p>This presentation offers a step by step approach, in which the whole process of a migration is
					covered. It is designed for large scaled companies with toolkits for automatic analysis and
					document conversion. Nevertheless it gives hints for non technical issues in the migration path
					as well as it outlines borders and show stopper. It is based on experiences in successful
					OpenOffice.org/StarOffice migration projects for professional companies of many branches.
					The practical experiences of .riess as Sun's first StarOffice Migration Partner in Germany
					offers precious guidance in your considerations in introducing StarOffice.</p>

					community then more or less silently endorses has allowed OpenOffice.org to maintain a
					coherent developmental trajectory and minimize fragmentation. However, in the last year,
					local community desires have begun to challenge the consensual system.</p>

						<strong>Translation Technology At Sun Microsystems, Inc.</strong>

					<td><p>
This paper aims to show how Sun Microsystems, Inc., uses translation
technology for its translation activities on StarOffice and other
projects. This material was presented at the GUADEC conference this
year, but might also be of interest to the OpenOffice.org community.
</p>
<p>
Primarily, we will share our experiences of how the use of open
standards such as XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) and
Translation Memory eXchange format (TMX) and the use of tools to process
these formats can increase translator productivity and aid in the
sharing of translations across multiple projects.
</p>
<p>
We will demonstrate our translation editor which has been developed
in-house and has been in use for several months on real-world
translations. In keeping with our tradition of supporting open
standards, our editor can load and save XLIFF files and can export TMX
files for use with other translation tools. We have had extensive
feedback from professional translators who have been using the system in
production and we will explain some of the features that were added to
accommodate their needs.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we will present our vision of translation technology and the
advantages it can bring to increase translator productivity and
translation accuracy.

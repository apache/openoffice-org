	<p><b>1. What does the Art project do ?</b>
	<BR><b>R:</b> The art project attempts to centralize all the OpenOffice.org related graphics 
	and the graphics creation process so that everybody can easily find the needed graphics in one
single location and in the same time all new graphics requests can be directed to a single place.
<br>Here is a small list of activities inside the project:
<ul>
<li><strong>Building an art directory containing the existing graphics accross OpenOffice.org
projects.</strong>
 - The aim is to create and maintain a single repository where everybody can look for
graphics related to OpenOffice.org. The way of doing it is by making contact with the projects,
finding out about the existing graphics and centralizing them in easy browsable galeries.
<li><strong>Creating new art</strong>
 - The OpenOffice.org project needs new graphics for its various components and activities. 
We encourage graphic artists to participate and contribute with their creations. 
<br>Wether we are
talking about new nice screenshots, new OpenOffice.org posters, nice CD-covers or improved GUI icons
sets, new contributions in all these fields and many others help the project evolve and remain
fresh. 
<br>There can be freely contributed artwork in which you can put everything you like (i.e. the
wallpapers), but there is also coordinated artwork which must be built according to certain
specifications in order to keep a unified visual identity of the project.
<br>In return for your contributions we will try to promote your volunteer work as much as we
can.
<li><strong>Translating and internationalizing art</strong> 
 - Cooperating with Native-Language
projects is one of our main goals in order to make the graphics art usable for all the
OpenOffice.org projects. This means translating existing art and newly created art into as many
languageas as we can and from specific languages into English in order for other projects to
bennefit from the contributions made by the Native-Languages projects.
</ul>

	<p><b>2. I want to help. How do I proceed ?</b>
	<BR><b>R:</b> After making yourself familiar with the project by reading the text pages, browsing
the galleries and becoming acquainted with the <a href="about-legal.html">legal issues</a> 
and acceptable licenses for the artwork, you should consider doing the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Browse our <a href="to-do-artwork.html">ARTWORK To-Do</a> list in order to see what is currently needed and if there is something to which you are able to
contribute.
<li><strong><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/servlets/Join">Register</a> with the

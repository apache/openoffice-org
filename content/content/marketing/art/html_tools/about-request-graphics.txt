<b>Need specific graphics for your project ?</b>
<br>
Here are a few directions on how to proceed:
<ol>
<li>First of all <a href="index.html#galleries">browse the galleries</a> to see if there has not
been created something that may suit your needs.
<li>If you are having difficulties in finding the right place, please consider asking for help on
the <a href="mailto:art@marketing.openoffice.org">mailing list</a>.
<li>If you did not find what you are looking for, please ask on the mailinglist about the
possibilities of creating the needed graphics and if there is someone that can take up the task.
<li>Consider filing an issue in IssueZilla describing the needed graphics and giving as many details
as you can. 
<br>Details on how to file an issue for the art project can be found <a
href="about-issuezilla.html">here</a>.

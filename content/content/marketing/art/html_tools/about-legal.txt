<p>
In order to protect your contributions and the Community's work from abuse,  
submitting artwork to the OpenOffice.org project must be done according to certain licensing
requirements.
<p>
<strong>OpenOffice.org accepted licenses:</strong><br>
For source code and binary distributions, OpenOffice.org uses the
<a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/lgpl_license.html">LGPL</a>/<a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/sissl_license.html">SISSL</a>; for documents, we
encourage the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/PDL.html">PDL</a>.  
For details, see <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/license.html">http://www.openoffice.org/license.html</a>.

<p>
<strong>Artwork licensing:</strong><br>
For artwork, graphics, icons, etc., we encourage the use of the
following licenses:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/PDL.html">PDL</a> - Public Document License
<li><a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/lgpl_license.html">LGPL</a>/<a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/sissl_license.html">SISSL</a> - covered by the Joint
Copyright Assignment form (JCA)  [Note that the JCA is not in itself a license].
</ul>
In addition, non-essential graphics may be accepted also if they are
licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/publicdomain-2?lang=en">Public Domain</a>
according to
the statement by <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.

<p>
<strong>Types of graphics and the accepted licenses:</strong><br>
There are two distinct types of graphics based on the licensing requirements:
<ol>
<li><strong>Graphics that define the Project's visual identity</strong> (e.g. logos, official
CD-Covers, etc) - this category requires you either to license the graphics under PDL or to submit a
JCA. The reasons for this requirement are stated above.
<li><strong>Aditional graphics</strong> that do not fit into the above category (e.g. wallpapers,
screenshots, etc.) - are accepted either with the above licensing or if you want, they can be
licensed unde Public Domain instead.
</ol>
<p>
<strong>In order to avoid any missunderstandings</strong>, each gallery inside the Art Project will
clearly specify the applicable licenses for that gallery so that you know from the beginning what licenses are needed
for the submitted artwork if you intend to contribute to a certain gallery.

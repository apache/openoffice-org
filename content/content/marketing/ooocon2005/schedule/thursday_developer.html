Internationalization for Localization (l10n for i18n)

The presentation will talk about the internationalization of the OpenOffice.org
application suite, internationalization that enables the software to run with
different localizations, hence the title "i18n for l10n". The presentation will
not cover the steps of localization and translation. Planned coverage is an
overview of the history of the i18n framework and its API, why it is there,
what it does, how it developed, how it interfaces with other components, for
example the ICU (International Components for Unicode), its relation with the
CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository), and how it is used by the applications.
I'll focus on how to add data and features for new locales, extensibility and
difficulties. Current obstacles and problems, ideas how to solve them and other
plans will give an outlook on what can be done in the near and not so near
future. Depending on the audience there will be a more or less extensive Q&A
session at the end. Since it is not possible to cover all aspects in a 30-40 
minutes presentation, I'll gather topics and opinions on the dev@l10n mailing
list during preparation to hopefully be able to satisfy the needs.

      <td><span style="font-style: italic;">Biography:
Eike Rathke was born 1959 in Hamburg, Germany.
Several years of travelling through Europe doing this and that.
He started working with computers in 1986 when in an education as
a technician for electronics, and beginning with traineeship he developed
hardware (a bit) and software for computer-aided production data acquisition
and quality assurance and sticked with that for some years, focusing on 
software development. He joined StarDivision in 1993, and the StarCalc 
application's team in 1994. Since 2000 he is also deeply involved with the
i18n framework, partly arisen from the various needs of the
number formatter used in Calc and other applications,
and the try to coordinate the related work.

<h3><a name="d3"></a>OpenOffice.org

    <tr class="b">
      <td><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>The
user interface of OpenOffice.org is based on its own graphical toolkit
that comes with a proprietary resource system. Dialogs are defined by
simple text files that contain descriptions of the controls, their
labels, and their size and position. During the build process those
text files are compiled into binary files used at runtime. The dialog
logic that instantiates the controls and that defines their behavior
has to be written in C++.<br>
This approach has several disadvantages. There is the need to recompile
parts of OpenOffice.org in order to make changes to the appearance or
behavior of a dialog. A layout functionality is completely missing that
would automatically reposition or resize controls in response to
changes in dialog size or language settings. Additionally, there is no
API that would enable developers to write external components using a
rich user interface like the native components shipped with
OpenOffice.org.<br>
A different approach is successfully used by applications based on the
Mozilla Platform. Their resource system is an XML application called
XUL (XML User-interface Language) that combines a scripting language
(JavaScript) with GUI widgets. Mozilla's Gecko engine that is normally
used to display web content is able to render XUL files and comes with
layout management and support for style sheets and skins.<br>
This talk will present the results of a feasibility study that is about
embedding the Gecko engine in OpenOffice.org. Its impact on dialog
design, prototyping and implementation will be discussed and a possible
long-term migration path will be proposed. A live demo will show a
prototype displaying sample dialogs written in XUL and JavaScript and
demonstrating additional applications of this approach.<br>

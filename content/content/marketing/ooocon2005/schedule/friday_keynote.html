Often, a rather theological discussion is made on whether the
OpenOffice.org Suite can be an effective substitute of the Microsoft
Office Suite. While clearly no license fees are required to use
OpenOffice.org, claims are made that there are other, more insidious
costs to consider, rather than the simple license cost. The discussion
is kept at a very high level of abstraction, complex enough to scare
/regular/ users to think at migrations in either way. In the opinion of
the speaker, the problem is not always straightforward and there is not
a single, Boolean answer that applies in any context. However, it is
possible to lay down a handful
factors to consider in evaluating the
costs of the migration and to use them as a guide in making informed
decisions. Such factors define the comprehensive cost in adopting a
tool, often called with the esoteric term "TCO" or Total Cost of
Ownership. In the talk a manageable structure for the TCO of
Office/OpenOffice.org is presented and sample case studies are
discussed.

Succi is Professor with Tenure at the Free University of Bolzano-Bozen,
Italy, where he directs the Center for Applied Software Engineering.
Before joining the Free University of Bolzano-Bozen, he has been
Professor with Tenure at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,
Associate Professor at the University of Calgary, Alberta, and
Assistant Professor at the University of Trento, Italy. He was also
chairman of a small software company, EuTec.
The research interest of Giancarlo Succi involve multiple areas of
software engineering, including
      <ol type="a">
        <li>open source
development - empirical studies of the evolution of open source
projects, analysis of the structure of the market in presence of
monopolies and open source products, tools supporting open source and
agile methodologies; </li>
        <li>agile methodologies,
with specific interest to the relationships of methodologies and
practices, determining the scope of the application of the different
agile methodologies; </li>
        <li>experimental software
engineering, - measuring the effectiveness of so called "software best
practices" using software metrics, standard statistical techniques,
statistical meta-analysis and neural networks, with special attention
to quality, reliability, and customer satisfaction; </li>
        <li>software engineering
over the Internet - development of means to implement tools on demands
(tools that can be downloaded from the Internet, rented on a "per-use"
basis), distributed repositories of reusable software components,
system for co-ordinating, managing, and accounting the work of
distributed teams, web services and software engineering; </li>
        <li>software
product lines and software reuse - when and how to establish a software
product line and to use domain analysis and engineering to make the
software product line cost effective, integrating a reuse policy inside
a software development process under the perspectives of programming
paradigm, process maturity, productivity, quality, legal issues, ...

      <td>We will be speaking
about legal, economical and technological aspects and the vision of
e-education on the national level in Slovenia. We will stress the idea
of an efficient production of didactic materials, training teachers and
using free and open-source software in education. We will also talk
about the necessity of establishing a center for knowledge exchange and
user support, setting up reference schools in regions, preparing
didactic materials on the basis of open-source aplications and a
de-centralized aspect of integrating IT into school system. We will
mention the activities of the OKO group, which started the plan to
introduce free and open-source software into national educational
system in 2003. We will finish off with an open discussion and an
invitation for further involvement from the participants. </td>

      <td>Biography: Bernard
Herman, electrical engineer was born 1952 in Celje. In 1977 he
completed his degree at the Faculty of electrical engineering in
Ljubljana, where he studied automatics. After his diploma he took a
post at Iskra Automatika, where he worked in software and hardware
development for computer control devices for control and supervision
industrial processes. In 1985 he took over the management of a project
for the development of industrial computer systems for control
machines, robots and technological processes. Together with his
colleagues, he received a national award for inventions and
improvements.<br>
In the next few years, he worked as an adviser on industrial
automatisation and informatisation. In 1997 he started his work in the
Slovenian goverment, at the Ministry of Finance, where he worked on
informatics, mostly in the area of establishing local and international
communication networks. <br>
In 2001 he started working for the Ministry of Education, Science and
Sports, where he was the lead of the information infrastructure
department. He continued his work in the area of IT in educational
establishments. In 2003 he started a project of introducing open-source
and free software into educational establishments and continued to work
on IT in 2005, when he was appointed as the lead of a workgroup to
prepare and analyze a report on the options of internet access for
school textbooks. He is currently involved in research activities about
the possibilities of collaboration between education establishments,
business subjects, public administration and society in the area of
using free and open-source solutions.

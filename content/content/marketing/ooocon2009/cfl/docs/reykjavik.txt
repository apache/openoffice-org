Hi there!
I would like to propose that you select Iceland as your next destination for
the OOoCon 2009.

Proposed Date(s): 16th-18th of September 2009
Location (country, city): Iceland, Reykjavik

Special visa or entry requirements (e.g. vaccinations): None for
Europeans and US citizens. Others depend.

Conference venue(s) (e.g. university campus, municipal buildings): In
Reykjavik there are two university campuses. The conference will most
likely be held at one of those university campuses. If necessary other
conference venues are available.

Conference facilities (e.g. WiFi, video streaming/recording): All
necessary equipment (e.g. video/streaming capabilities), free wifi on
campus, cafe's, hotels, etc.

Accommodation (especially any low cost hostels etc): Hostels, low rate
hotels and other hotels. New hostel is opening in central Reykjavik in May

External transport links (nearest airport(s)): Keflavik International
airport (40 km). Frequent transportation to the bus terminal in
Reykjavik, the youth hostel and other locations via FlyBus available
for a small fee.

Internal transport links (within city): Buses (public transportation),
taxis, sightseeing bus (hop on/hop off).

Team Lead (main contact person): Thorir Tryggvason (thorirt@huxandi.net)

Team Members (all members should be willing and able to commit at
least 3 hours per day to planning the conference during the last two
weeks before OOoCon 2009): The Organization for Digital Freedom in
Iceland (FSFI). The organization's goal is to spread knowledge and
information about digital freedom in Iceland. FSFI holds, for example,
an annual conference for the Icelandic public to raise awareness in
digital freedoms. In 2008 Eben Moglen and John Perry Barlow were
keynote speakers.

Local events that are taking place in parallel (or
immediatelybefore/after): The team is ready to plan and arrange for
activities, both low cost and more expensive ones. Activities could
include a trip to Gullfoss (the real one), mountain trips,
sightseeing, outdoor spas/swimming pools and more. Reykjavik is full
of tourist attractions for conference goers who'd like to plan tours
for themselvers, such as ghost tours, viking shows, museums, pubs, etc.

Iceland is situated in the middle of the Atlantic and is therefore
easily reachable from both Europe and the USA. With the recent fall of
the Icelandic currency (ISK) the cost for visitors has fallen sharply
and the country has become affordable (it used to be expensive for
tourists). There are all sorts of accommodation available, from cheap
hostels to high class hotels. A large group of Icelanders offer
accomodation via CouchSurfing[2]. The time of the year is perfect as
most tourists have left (no accomodation problems) and Icelanders are
starting work and school, open to new ideas and opportunities.

The public and private sector, and the general population in Iceland
have limited awareness of FOSS. Recently there has been an increased
interest in FOSS. OOoCon would enhance this interest and generate more
curiosity for FOSS, especially OpenOffice.org. The government of Iceland
has, for instance, released a policy on Free and Open Source
Software[1]. The uptake of this policy has been slow but has generated
some interest in FOSS. Many public and private institutions are looking
at OpenOffice.org as a viable option but are afraid of testing it. With
OOoCon, we could give them the push.

Iceland is a country that needs to really have a look at all possible
ways to save money after the financial crash of 2008. The conference
would open the eyes of many companies and governmental institutions for
the possibilities of other software than proprietary software. The
aforementioned policy was created mostly with cost savings in mind, both
short term and long term. A nation heavily dependent on one company
(Microsoft), its office bundle, and old document formats, needs to look
at other options. Awareness in OpenOffice.org is needed and OOoCon is
the perfect way to achieve it.

Iceland is simply an awesome location for the OOoCon (think of the photo
opportunity: GullFoss bloggers at Gullfoss, drinking a beer named Gullfoss).

Iceland is the ideal place for fun and action packed nightlife once the
conference is over.  There is only a short ride to a fantastic nature
and scenic experience. If you are lucky, you might catch a glint of
aurora borealis winding through the sky at night.

OOoCon should enjoy a refreshing location in a country with a history
and great heritage like Iceland. Vote for Iceland and experience a great
OOoCon 2009 at the world's northernmost capital.

OpenOffice.org 1.0 Marketing Materials



CD AND FLOPPY DISK MATERIALS



This folder contains the CD and floppy disk related materials for 

OpenOffice.org. They are:



CD LABELS

=========

There are a number of files which contain CD label designs. Currently,

just PNG versions are provided. If you require different sizes or

formats, please email me (address below).



standard

--------

This is a standard label with the blue horizon and OpenOffice.org

logo (with "Community Distributor" underneath). Discs with this

label could contain *any* OpenOffice.org related content.



1.0

---

This is a very similar design to "standard", but with the "OpenOffice.org

Community Distributor" logo replaced with a bold "OpenOffice.org 1.0"

logo instead.



minimalist

----------

A variation on one of the first designs I did; this one does not include

the blue horizon.



USAGE

-----

Each of these graphics includes a "bleed". That is, they are designed to

be printed so that the edge of the graphic is slightly outside the

CD label area. This prevents white edges during printing.



See the file "ooo-cd-label-showing-bleed.png" to see this. The pink lines

here represent the edges of the label. When placing these graphics, try

to approximate this pink border. PLEASE DO NOT PRINT LABELS WITH

THESE PINK BLEED MARKS.



It is recommended that if you wish to add further text to the label

(for example more detailed contents of the disc), that such text is

included within the largest light blue area underneath the CD hole.

(In a sympathetic typeface if possible -- the logo uses Fritiger, so this

typeface or a variation of it is ideal).





CD ENVELOPE

===========

Also in this folder is an Acrobat file for a CD envelope. This is to be

printed onto thin card. Full instructions are given within the PDF file.





FLOPPY DISK LABELS

==================



There are also designs here for floppy disk labels. These are designed

for the OpenOffice.org 1.0 Press Pack and contain "Useful Links" text.

I can provide other versions on request.





If you have any questions or comments on any of these materials, please

OpenOffice.org 1.0 Marketing Materials

STANDARD LOGOS

This folder contains the standard OpenOffice.org logos.

There are two logos here; the standard (community) one, and the
"OpenOffice.org 1.0" logo. The latter is a very simple design, but
has a typeface and "rounded dot" to fit in with the rest of the
standard logo.

Standard logos all begin "ooo-main-logo"; 1.0 logos all begin
"ooo-1.0-logo". Both logos are provided in the standard two colour
version as well as a one colour (black only) version. In each case, 
versions are provided in vector (EPS) and bitmap (PNG) formats.
The bitmaps are of an arbitrary size, and there are transparent 
and non-transparent versions.

Note that the OpenOffice.org blue colour is officially Pantone 286.
This colour is used in the two colour EPS files. In the bitmaps,
this has been represented with the colour R:006 G:052 B:140
(#06348C for web designers).

If anyone has any problems with these logos, please contact 
me: lee@lcdweb.co.uk.

<h3>How to submit a Proposal</h3>
<p>Note. As the OpenOffice.org community consists of members from countries all over the world the talk must be in English.</p>
<p>Please limit your presentation to 50 minutes, including questions.</p>
<p>Submissions must be made via the link on the Conference website. The link will be available on Monday 2nd April and your proposal (abstract) must be submitted before <strong>1st June</strong> in order to be considered for inclusion in the Conference.</p>
<h4>Types of Session</h4>
<p>A presentation is a general discussion of some topic, including (but not limited to) the software, the community, relationships with other software or communities, and political or philosophical issues.</p>
<p>A case study is a specific type of presentation that tells what you did to achieve some result; this is usually a success story, but could include a discussion of what mistakes you made and how you overcame them.</p>
<p>A workshop is a"how-to"session, in which the presenter gives step-by-step instructions for doing some task such as writing macros, setting up a database, or developing a complex spreadsheet. Workshops usually include some audience activities.</p>
<p>A BoF (Birds of a Feather meeting) is an informal gathering of people in a particular group, or interested in a specific topic. Examples include the members of a native-language group, the marketing project, documentation writers, or Macintosh coders.</p>
<p>A panel discussion involves a group of people (usually 3 or 4) led by a moderator. The participants make opening and closing statements on the topic, may discuss the topic among themselves, and may answer questions from the audience (usually submitted in advance).</p>
<p>A lightning talk is a brief presentation on any topic relevant to the conference. It could be an interesting format to give many people the chance to make their point in a series of exactly 5 minute slots.</p>
<h3>Travel Subsidy</h3>
<p>The template for paper submission includes a section for requesting a travel subsidy. At this point we are not in a position to offer funding for all speakers, and those speakers who do get a subsidy are unlikely to have their full expenses covered. Each request will be considered on the basis of both merit and need, so if you are requesting a subsidy, please give as much information as possible to help us evaluate your request. Please note that someone presenting only a lightning talk is unlikely to receive assistance.</p>
<h3>Presentation Materials</h3>
<p>An OpenOffice.org Impress template recommended for use for the conference presentations will be published around <strong>1 June 2007</strong>. All speakers are required to file a copy of their presentations with the Conference organisers. These presentations will be filed on the Conference website.</p>
<p>Please note that your session may be streamed as a live broadcast and may be recorded and made available for download from the Conference website.</p>

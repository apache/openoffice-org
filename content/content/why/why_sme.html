<p>Enterprises from corner-shops to corporate giants are turning to Apache OpenOffice to power their businesses. The <strong>flexible word processor</strong>, <strong>powerful spreadsheet</strong>, <strong>dynamic graphics</strong>, <strong>database access</strong> and more meet all the requirements for an office software package.</p>
<p>OpenOffice offers a high degree of compatibility with commercial office software, but with none of the costs or license worries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The no-hassle answer</strong></p>
<p>For small businesses, IT is a hassle and an expense. Apache OpenOffice is simply the easiest and cheapest way of providing the essential software tools required to support a growing business. Developed over twenty years, OpenOffice is a mature, stable, product, guaranteeing trouble-free usage. Behind the scenes, it stores all your valuable data in a format approved by the International Organization for Standardization - the first software package in the world to meet this exacting standard. As more companies adopt the standard, exchanging data between office software, accounting software, planning software - any software - will become as easy as saving and opening a file. No transcription errors, no typing the same information twice - no hassle computing.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Better but compatible</strong></p>
<p>Apache OpenOffice prides itself on its compatibility with other office software. Companies moving to OpenOffice simply take their existing files with them. In fact, changing to OpenOffice may be a simpler process than having to upgrade because your commercial software vendor has brought out a new version. OpenOffice also understands that no business is an island, which is why it can exchange files with other office software - for example, the one your accountants use. It also allows you to create PDF files for those all-important times when you want to retain control of documents after they leave your office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open for business</strong></p>
<p>Amazingly, Apache OpenOffice comes without any license fees, or any worrying small print. You can install it on as many computers as you like, use it for any purpose, and even give copies away for employees to use at home. No more threats of heavy-handed software audits disturbing your business. You don&rsquo;t even have to worry about what to install - OpenOffice is one complete package. If you need extra languages, simply install them.</p>

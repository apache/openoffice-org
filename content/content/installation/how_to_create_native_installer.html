OpenOffice.org 2.x<BR></B></FONT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>by <A HREF="mailto:is@openoffice.org">Ingo Schmidt</A></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4><BR>Introduction:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">This HowTo describes the necessary
steps to create native installation sets for OpenOffice.org 2.0. This
includes Windows Installer for the Windows platform, RPMs for Linux
and Solaris-packages for Solaris. Because of the usage of EPM is will
also be possible to create native installation sets for all operating
systems supported by EPM. In the current EPM version 3.7 this are:
AIX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, HP-UX, Debian software distribution,
IRIX, MacOS X. The currently available process is adapted to Windows,
Linux and Solaris. Therefore it might be necessary to make some
changes in the new packaging process for the other platforms. The
installation sets are created in the new cvs module
&bdquo;instsetoo_native&ldquo;, but it is also still possible to
create installation sets using the old setup application in the cvs
module &bdquo;instsetoo&ldquo;. But in the near future we want to
remove the module &bdquo;instsetoo&ldquo; and with it the old setup
application located in the cvs module &bdquo;setup2&ldquo;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4>The packaging program:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">New CVS modules were introduced for the
usage of native installer. This are &bdquo;setup_native&ldquo; and
&bdquo;instsetoo_native&ldquo;. Additionally the packaging program
was added to the &bdquo;solenv&ldquo; module. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><U>&bdquo;solenv&ldquo;</U>: The new
packaging program is completely Perl based. You find it in
solenv/bin. The main program is called &bdquo;make_installer.pl&ldquo;.
It uses all the Perl submodules located in
solenv/bin/modules/installer.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><U>&bdquo;setup_native&ldquo;</U>: This
new cvs module contains at the moment the Windows Installer custom
actions, that are executed during the installation process.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><U>&bdquo;instsetoo_native&ldquo;</U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">:
This is the new packaging module. In the output tree of
&bdquo;instsetoo_native&ldquo; the installation sets are created. You
will find there also a preregistered services.rdb, many unpacked zip
files, logging files and many files more. Therefore you need
sufficient disc space for the &bdquo;instsetoo_native&ldquo;
directory. This shows that the new packaging process includes much
functionality, that was included in our old setup application, but is
not supported by the native installers. Therefore is also takes more
time to create the native installation sets, but we are still trying
to optimize this process.</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4>The packaging process:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Included in the new packaging process
are different Perl programs, that create the native installation sets
based on the information stored in our platform independent
installation set description language &bdquo;scp&ldquo;. Files,
directories, and many things more are described in the cvs module
&bdquo;scp2&ldquo;. Based on these files, a platform and product
specific setup script is created, which is then used by the new
packaging process to create the native installation sets. The
different processes are shown in the following graphic:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4>Prerequisites:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For the new native packaging process,
new prerequisites are needed. Especially there are different
prerequisites for the Windows OS and the non-Windows OS:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><U>Windows</U>: For creating
successfully Windows Installer installation sets it is needed, that
you have installed the Windows Plattform SDK with Windows Installer
SDK, Version February 2003. This is available at
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/</A>
.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The two Windows Installer files
instmsia.exe and instmsiw.exe (non-Unicode and Unicode version of the
Windows Installer service) have also to be downloaded from the
Microsoft homepage. For the packaging process they have to be located
in the directory &bdquo;instsetoo_native/inc_openoffice/windows/msifiles&ldquo;.
This will probably change in the near future.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><U>Non-Windows</U>:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For the non-Windows platforms it is
essential, that you have installed EPM, v. 3.7 on your system. You
can download it from <A HREF="http://www.easysw.com/epm/">http://www.easysw.com/epm/</A></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Using EPM for Linux or Solaris we
approve the usage of a patch, that can be downloaded <A HREF="epm-3.7.patch">here</A>.
This patch fixes the following problems:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The RPMs or Solaris packages are
relocatable. This means, that the administrator can change the
OpenOffice.org installation directory. Non relocatable RPMs or
Solaris packages are always installed at a fixed place in the
directory system. In the version 4.0 of EPM it is planned, to make
the packages relocatable, then this patch becomes superfluous.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A second problem occurs only on Linux
and is caused by some dependency problems of the OpenOffice.org
libraries. Without the patch the OpenOffice.org core RPM can only be
installed with the parameter &bdquo;--nodeps&ldquo;. If you use the
patch, you can simply install &bdquo;rpm -i
openoffice-core-680-1.i586.rpm&ldquo;.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Using Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 maximum
package name contains 9 characters. Because this is not sufficient
for for the different OpenOffice.org packages, we decided to make use
of Bug 4025718, which introduces the maximum of 25 characters for a
package name. This requires that the following patches are installed
on Solaris systems:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>The longer packages names we
introduce by Bug 4025718. <BR>If your building packages on Solaris 8
you need patches: <BR>110934-12 (sparc) &amp; 110935-12 (x86) <BR>If
your building packages on Solaris 9 you need patches: <BR>113713-03
(sparc) &amp; 114568-02 (x86)

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=4>Installation of native
installation sets:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><U>Windows:</U> The installation set is
located in the directory
instsetoo_native/wntmsci10.pro/OpenOffice/install . You find there an
executable &bdquo;setup.exe&ldquo;, which you can simply start. Then
you get the well-known Windows Installer GUI that will guide you
through the installation process. The OpenOffice.org can only be
removed with the &bdquo;Add-Remove-Software-Applet&ldquo;, that is
located in the Control Panel.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P><U>Linux</U>: The installation set is located in the directory
instsetoo_native/unxlngi5.pro/OpenOffice/install . You find there
different RPMs belonging to the installation set. You can decide
wheter you want to install all of them or only parts. The names of
the RPMs are not fix yet. First of all you have to install the core
RPM openoffice-core-680-1.i586.rpm. All other RPMs have a dependency
to this core package. For installing a RPM you need to have root
priviliges. Than you can simply install it by :</P>
<P>rpm -i openoffice-core-680-1.i586.rpm --prefix=/opt/myOOOdir
(relocatable with the optional parameter --prefix) 
</P>
<P>Without using the EPM patch, you also have to use the parameter
&bdquo;--nodeps&ldquo;.</P>
<P>You can remove the RPM with the command (this is also system
dependent)</P>
<P>rpm -e openoffice-core-680-1.i586.rpm</P>
<P><U>Solaris</U>: The installation set is located in the directory
instsetoo_native/unxsols4.pro/OpenOffice/install
(instsetoo_native/unxsoli4.pro/OpenOffice/install for Solaris x86) .
You find there different Solaris packages belonging to the
installation set. You can decide wheter you want to install all of
them or only parts. The names of the packages are not fix yet. First
of all you have to install the core package OOOopenoffice-core. All
other packages have a dependency to this core package. For installing
a Solaris package you need to have root priviliges. Than you can
simply install it by :</P>
<P>pkgadd -a adminfile.txt -d . OOOopenoffice-core (relocatable with
the optional admin file (parameter -a) in which
&quot;basedir=/opt/myOOOdir&quot; has to be defined) 
</P>
<P>You can remove the Solaris package with the command:</P>
<P>pkgrm OOOopenoffice-core</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>And now have fun with the native installer :-)</P>

Note:  This directory is not really for servlets.  It is here to offer landing pages for the many external
links to the legacy OpenOffice.org website that pointing to servlets used by the legacy website for
signing up volunteers, reading list archives, joining mailing lists, etc.

The directory structure here mimics the legacy servlet calls but substitutes static webpages
that direct the user to the appropriate content.

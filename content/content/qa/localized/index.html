<h1>QA Process for Localized Builds</h1>
<p>This process is in progress, and as better processes become
apparent, we will follow them and change this guideline. The testing of
the builds deeply involves the QA and Native-Lang projects. Notices
pointing to this process guideline will be posted on those projects and
also on the <a href="http://l10n.openoffice.org" target="_blank">l10n</a>
project.</p>
<h3>Where do the localizations
come from?</h3>
<p>Localized builds are created by
the community. The <a href="http://l10n.openoffice.org" target="_blank">l10n</a>
project
coordinates this activity, and one can view the status of any ongoing
localization by checking the status page.</p>
<h3>What do we do here, in QA?</h3>
<p>The point of having QA test
these builds is to reduce the
possibility that the builds won't work. They may still be rough, but by
going through the QA process, we can at least ensure that we won't be
sending out to the world builds that can't be installed, won't work at
all, ...</p>
<h3>What is the QA process?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Localized builds are made
available at several places. These are:
    <ul>
      <li>the mirror network under
the /contrib/rc directory for most
of the builds provided by hamburg release engineering.</li>
      <li><a
 href="http://oootranslation.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/">http://oootranslation.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/</a>
for language packs or full builds provided by hamburg release
engineering.</li>
      <li>places used by
contributors for different platform builds.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>The builds are registered and managed in <a href="http://qatrack.services.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org QATrack</a>. 
  The builds are submitted by the QA project, and updated by each build's responsible to indicate the
build's current status. Often the responsible is one of the qa responsibles in the Native Lang community.<br/>
For more information about 
OpenOffice.org QATrack, see the system's <a href="http://qatrack.services.openoffice.org/help.php">Help 
section</a>.<br/>
There might be a slight delay for the submission of some builds. Therefore, for most current information about the 
availability of these builds you should subscribe to the relevant mailing lists:
  <ul>
    <li>releases@openoffice.org</li>
    <li>dev@porting.openoffice.org</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  <li>Native-Lang leads or their
delegates assigned to the task of
helping QA the builds download the builds and run through a series of
tests. This process should begin immediately upon the availability of
localized release candidates and should not take more than two weeks
from beginning to end. For managing those testcases, test assignemnts
and results we use the <a
 href="http://www.sunvirtuallab.com/tcm2/opensource/tcm_index.cgi?tcm_config=newooo">TCM</a>
(Test Case Management) Portal</li>
  <li>An IssueTracker ticket should
be filed so as to move the tested
builds over to the /localized directory for proper downstream
dissemination and to update the pages. Mirrors need to be notified by
the Distribution project lead.<br>
This should be filed as "Task" for Componente "qa", subcomponent "www".
Assign it to the default owner and make shure, you name the exact
location of the files that have been used for testing.</li>
  <li>Finally, once the mirror
network has indicated that the builds
have been successfully uploaded into the proper directory, the builds
may be announced by the appropriate persons, such as the Native-Lang
leads and Community Manager.</li>

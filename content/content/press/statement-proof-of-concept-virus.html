<h3>Statement on the Proof of Concept Macro Virus </h3>
<p>There has been press comment recently about a &quot;proof-of-concept macro 
  virus&quot; affecting OpenOffice.org and reported in a blog at an anti-virus 
  company. [1] </p>
<p>Macros are a useful part of any office suite, allowing users to automate 
  repetitive tasks. These tasks include potentially destructive actions 
  such as modifying and deleting files, which is why macros are of 
  interest to virus writers.</p>
<p>The &quot;proof-of-concept macro virus&quot; showed that it is possible to write a 
  simple &quot;virus-like&quot; program using OpenOffice.org's macro language. This 
  is a known risk with any capable macro language. To mitigate against 
  this risk, by default OpenOffice.org detects if a document contains 
  macros, displays a warning, and will only run the macro if the user 
  specifically agrees. This behaviour conforms to industry best practice.</p>
<p>The OpenOffice.org engineers take the security of the software very 
  seriously, and will react promptly to any new issues. This &quot;proof of 
  concept&quot; virus is not new information, and does not require a software 
  patch. Technically, it is not even a virus, as it is not 
&quot;self-replicating&quot; - with OpenOffice.org's default settings, it cannot 
  spread without user intervention.</p>
<p>However, the OpenOffice.org community repeats the consistent message 
  from security experts that users should never accept files from unknown 
  sources. For any security issue, please visit OpenOffice.org's Security 
  Team page [2] and send a note to security@openoffice.org.</p>

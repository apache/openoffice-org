</p>

<p>
Thailand:</p>

is discounting Windows and Office down to $36.
</p>

<p>
South Africa:</p>
<p class="indent">

of PC's in South Africa, has begun to ship OpenOffice.org 1.0.x with

</ul>

<p></p>

</div>

<p class="Header">
3) What makes OpenOffice.org 1.1 unique?

	  in development</li>

	<li>programming support for Java, C++, Basic, OLE and further  programming languages/technologies</li>
	<li>OpenOffice.org fosters the creation of new businesses and jobs (e.g. Sun
	  Microsystems' StarOffice or Novell's Ximian Desktop), growing number of
	  independent system integrators and  consultants</li>
  </ul>




<p class="Header">
4) What makes OpenOffice.org 1.1 different from OpenOffice.org 1.0?
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a href="#21">See 2.1!</a>
</p>




<p class="Header">
5) What are the marketing goals for this announcement?
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Widest possible dissemination of the new software</li>
	<li>growth in developer base</li>
</ul>



<p class="Header">
6) What are the 3 Key Messages?
</p>


<ul>
	<li>new features, stability and look & feel improvements (see <a href="#21">2.1</a> for details)</li>
	<li>OpenOffice.org 1.1 is free and open source</li>
	<li>OpenOffice.org 1.1 is cross platform and multi-lingual </li>
</ul>



<p class="Header">
7) Is this announcement part of a larger strategy?
</p>


<ul>
	<li>to grow the user- and developer-base for OpenOffice.org</li>
	<li>to increase the market share of non-Microsoft platforms</li>
	<li>  in order to reinvigorate competition in the office</li>
	<li>  productivity space</li>
</ul>



<p class="Header">
8) How does this news help the user/developer/customer?
</p>

<p class="indent">Less training with even greater productivity. Access to office suite
software with no licence fees and no time-consuming license management
requirements.</p>


<p class="Header">
9) Why should users care?
</p>
<div class="indent">

<p>
There may be no other office suite software available with
character-set, menus, help and spelling dictionaries in their first
language.
</p>

<p>
All users can now download an office suite for no charge that is
extremely stable on their operating system platform and gain unmatched
productivity with equal or less training than it takes to upgrade to a
new version of the leading proprietary office suite.
</p>

<p>
Users and their organizations will enter a new open and well supported
office suite arena where they will never again worry about support or
file format continuity being broken by their software vendor.
</p>

<p>
Cost and productivity savings are beyond estimation.
</p>
</div>

<p class="Header">
10) What are some of the specific differentiators?
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Users and systems administrators can use different operating systems
in-house and still have all documents created and stored in a single
future-proof XML file format where fine-granular content within
documents is finely searchable and extendable to the Web.
</p>

<p>
An OpenOffice.org document's native XML file format allows content to be accessed,
managed and extended OUTSIDE the office suite application, for example,
with viewing, editing and transmitting file content with small hand-held
devices and PDA's. Despite the open file format confidential documents
can be password protected which includes a 128-bit encryption of the
content.
</p>

<p>
OpenOffice.org has many language versions of the software in development, some
  of
which are typically not supported by traditional office suites, e.g.
Zulu, Sotho and Afrikaans in South Africa. As a consequence 
OpenOffice.org will be available to many more users around the world
in their first language.

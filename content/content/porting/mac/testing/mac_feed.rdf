      <title>April 2006</title>
      <description>There has been some confusion about the relationship between OpenOffice.org
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;and NeoOffice and we would like to clear things up.

    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;Our focus is and must be porting OpenOffice.org to the Mac. In the last
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;year, we have been very successful in getting 2.0 to the Mac OS (X11) and
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;our team now includes many. We are further taking the port to Mac Intel, and
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;beta builds are running of this. These are real and important
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;accomplishments, and they could not have been done without the support of
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;the community. Our ultimate goal is to fully port OpenOffice.org to Mac OS X
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;on Aqua. For that, we need all the help the Mac community can provide.

    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;Direct links to NeoOffice were removed because our focus is on
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;OpenOffice.org, not NeoOffice, which is a derivation based substantially
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;(more than 98 percent) on OpenOffice.org code. If the OpenOffice.org coding
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;effort is to be successful, we need for users to work directly with us.

    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;We have no argument with NeOffice and wish them the best in their efforts.
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;Their approach differs from ours but satisfies many users. We invite them to
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;work with us in building OpenOffice.org 2.0.3 and beyond and in fully
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;porting OpenOffice.org to the Mac. We are also open to the idea of
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;collaborating: exchanging ideas and code (when possible) in a useful,
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;friendly, and productive way.

    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;We hope this clears up some of the misunderstandings. Again, we invite
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;friendly collaboration and cooperation and would like for the Mac community
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;to help us port OpenOffice.org to Aqua.

    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;If you want to join the fun, go to Mac Porting site Our list is
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;mac@porting.openoffice.org.</description>

      <description>There was a donation of two iMac Intel 20&quot; to OpenOffice.org. One
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;for Tino Rachui and one for Stephan Schaefer. These very fast machines
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;will replace old G3&apos;s, which were good but slow machines.</description>

      <title>Late January, 2006</title>
      <description>OpenOffice.org announced the first build of
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;OpenOffice.org 2.0.1 for Mac OS X (X11) that can run natively on the
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;newly released Macintosh Intel desktops. No other fully equipped office
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;suite can claim as much, and ours gives users not just standards
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;compliance but real interoperability. Led by Eric Bachard, the
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;team includes Eric Hoch, NAKATA Maho, Tino Rachui, Sophie Gautier,
   &amp;#9;&amp;#9;Pavel Janik, David Nedrow, James Mckenzie, Filip Molcan, &quot;Mox&quot;,
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;and many, many others. The group, which created this version in very
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;little time indeed, is now eager to move even faster--with your help.
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;Download the build, test it, participate. We are way ahead of the
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;Redmond folks, let&apos;s keep it that way!

    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;The builds provided for Intel based Macs are alpha and thus risky.
    &amp;#9;&amp;#9;They only run on Mac-Intel boxes.</description>

<p><b>These are the available/deprecated command line arguments in
OpenOffice.</b><br>
(Lastest changes: November 5th 2002)<br>
<br>
<b><br>
appserver</b><br>
<br>
Obsolete, not used anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>-embedding</b><br>
<br>
Obsolete, not used anymore.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>-minimized</b><br>
<br>
This argument only controls the visibility of the intro bitmap during
startup. There is no code that minimizes the first window after startup.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>-invisible</b><br>
<br>
The office doesn't show the intro bitmap during startup and doesn't
open the first default document. After startup there is no visible UI
although using the Office API it is possible to open visible
documents/dialogs. The only way to shutdown the office is through the
Office API or using the task manager / kill command.<br>
<b><br>
<br>
-norestore</b><br>
<br>
Don't restart office and restore all opened documents automatically
after an exception. <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>-bean</b><br>
<br>
Obsolete, currently it only controls the creation of the default
document. In the past this argument influenced the registration, crash
mail and other features.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>-server</b><br>
<br>
This argument is like -invisible, additionally the ucb component is
configured using the configuration key
/org.openoffice.ucb.Configuration/ContentProviders/['Server']/SecondaryKeys/['Office']/ProviderData
instead of
/org.openoffice.ucb.Configuration/ContentProviders/['Local']/SecondaryKeys/['Office']/ProviderData
to support a remote file system. This configuration data is NOT included
in OpenOffice so normally you cannot use it. Please use -invisible
instead. <br>
There are some limitations for this command line argument. All "open",
"print", "print to" commands on the command line are ignored. No default
document is opened. After startup there is no visible UI although using
the Office API it is possible to open visible documents/dialogs. The
only way to shutdown the office is through the Office API or using the
task manager / kill command.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>-quickstart</b><br>
<br>

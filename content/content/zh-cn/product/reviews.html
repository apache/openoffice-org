<p><em>Version 3.0 of OpenOffice.org does add significant new features, and since in these financially turbulent times it costs nothing to install, it could reduce bottom line expenditure significantly if deployed extensively. We experienced few problems with the suite that couldn&rsquo;t be circumvented with workarounds. We think system administrators should give it a close look, especially if they&rsquo;re rolling out thousands of minimally used copies of Microsoft Office with only features like basic formatting, spell checking, and word count really being needed.</em></p>

<p><em>After using OpenOffice&rsquo;s MS Word analog, Writer, all day, I can confirm that this update is worth it for the improvement in response and load times, if nothing else. The installation is still enormous, with an installer about 130MB for Windows users and 160MB for Mac, but the installation process is smoother. From start to finish, it clocked in at around 5 minutes, significantly faster than installing OpenOffice 2. People who use OpenOffice as their primary productivity suite should take advantage of the OpenOffice Quickstarter, which noticeably accelerates program launch times and has been made even faster in version 3.</em></p>

<p><em>Overall, does OpenOffice.org 3.0 provide a step forward? Yes, with extra features and some performance improvements at startup, although in use it still feels sluggish and clunky in places. Does it justify the jump in major version number? We&rsquo;re not convinced, but the 2.x series has been around for a while and this release does present a fresh face, and more scope for extensions with the internal changes. On balance, the new OpenOffice.org release is a step forward, and if they can speed it up a bit for 3.1 we&rsquo;ll be more than happy.</em></p>

<li><strong>PC Pro Magazine</strong> delivers its verdict on Version 2:
<p><em>Our pick of the low-cost office suites has had a much-needed overhaul, and now battles Microsoft in terms of features, not just price.</em></p>
<p>OpenOffice.org 2 earns <img src="/product/pix/6stars.gif" alt="Six stars" /> in <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/80012/openoffice-2.html">Issue 135, Jan 06</a>. The magazine&rsquo;s reviewer concludes:</p>
<p><em>OpenOffice certainly doesn&rsquo;t lack features compared to the market leader, and most of its ease-of-use issues stem from people&rsquo;s familiarity with Microsoft Office rather than an inherent problem with the program itself. As such, you should certainly try OpenOffice&rsquo;s offering before donating another UKP100 or more to Microsoft&rsquo;s coffers. After all, it&rsquo;s free.</em></p>

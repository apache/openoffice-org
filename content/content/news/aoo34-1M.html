    <h2>Sampling of Press Coverage</h2>
    <p>Nick Peers at <a 
href="http://betanews.com/2012/05/09/apache-releases-big-openoffice-upgrade-get-it-now/">BetaNews</a> leads "Apache releases big OpenOffice upgrade -- get it now!" 
        and then summarizes the new features:</p> 

<blockquote>Version 3.4's major features can be found under the hood 
&mdash; vastly improved startup times, improved OLEObject handling, better chart 
rendering and support for scalable vector graphics are the most notable changes 
in this new release. Also implemented is ODF 1.2 encryption, while the suite is 
now licensed under the Apache License 2 engine.</blockquote>

    href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/05/openoffice-3-4-released/">OMG! 
    Ubuntu!</a> Joey Sneddon writes:  "Apache OpenOffice 3.4 doesn't do anything 
    drastic, but does iterate nicely upon that which was there before."</p>
    
    <p>More coverage from Paula Rooney, <a 
    href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/apache-openoffice-34-makes-official-debut-libreoffice-makes-its-case/10915">ZDNet</a>.

After listing the "new bells and whistles" in Apache OpenOffice 3.4 ("welcome 
news") Paula then stresses the importance of future project progress:</p> 
 
<blockquote>...[F]or the Apache Software Foundation &mdash; and for long term 
supporters of the open source Office suite &mdash; this next stage of 
development, free from vendor control &mdash; offers its best chance to date to 
attract more users and backers.</blockquote> 

    <p>Iain Thomspon at <a 
        href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/05/08/apache_openoffice_graphics_version/">The Register</a> highlighted the "major changes" made to the OpenOffice 
        graphics capabilities, mentioning specifically the work of programmer 
        Armin Le Grand.</p>

    <p>Over at <a 
    href="http://www.tweaktown.com/news/24053/download_of_the_day_openoffice_3_4_0/index.html">TweakTown</a>, Anthony Garreffa's article extolls AOO 3.4 as their 
"Download of the Day", saying that Apache OpenOffice 3.4 is:
</p>

<blockquote>...the result of over twenty years' 
software engineering. Designed from the start as a single piece of software, it 
has a consistency other products cannot match. A completely open development 
process means that anyone can report bugs, request new features, or enhance the 
software.</blockquote>

<p><em>Letting you concentrate on writing your ideas</em></p>
<p><strong>Writer</strong> has everything you would expect from a modern, fully equipped word processor.</p>
<p>It is simple enough for a quick memo, yet powerful enough to create complete books with contents, diagrams, indexes, etc. You&rsquo;re free to concentrate on your ideas while Writer makes them look great.</p>
<p><em>Wizards</em> take all the hassle out of producing standard documents such as letters, faxes, agendas, minutes, or carrying out more complex tasks such as mail merges. Of course, you are also free to create your own templates, or <a href="http://templates.openoffice.org" title="Download Apache OpenOffice Templates">download templates</a> from our Templates repository.</p>
<p><em>Styles and Formatting</em> puts the power of style sheets into the hands of every user.</p>
<p><em>AutoCorrect dictionary</em> can trap typing mistakes on the fly, checking your spelling as you type. Writer can handle the use of different languages in your document too.</p>
<p><em>AutoComplete</em> reduces typing effort, it will suggest common words and phrases to complete what you are typing.</p>
<p><em>Text frames</em> and <em>linking</em> give you the power to tackle desktop publishing tasks for newsletters, flyers, etc. laid out exactly the way you want them to be.</p>
<p><em>Table of Contents &amp; References</em> - Increase the usefulness of your long, complex documents by generating a table of contents or indexing terms, bibliographical references, illustrations, tables, and other objects.</p>
<p><em>Multi-page display</em> - Writer can also display multiple pages while you edit - ideal for complex documents. Works well with large and multiple monitors.</p>
<p><em>Notes</em> - The notes feature displays notes and comments on the side of the document. This makes notes a lot easier to read. In addition, notes from different users are displayed in different colors together with the editing date and time.</p>
<p><em>HTML, PDF, MediaWiki formats</em> - Make your documents freely available with Writer&rsquo;s HTML export to the web, or export in MediaWiki format for publishing to wikis. Publish in Portable Document Format (.pdf) to guarantee that what you write is what your reader sees. The PDF export feature in Apache OpenOffice provides a huge set of formatting and security options; so that PDF files can be customized for many different scenarios, including ISO standard PDF/A files.</p>
<p><em>.odt Standard</em> - Save your documents in OpenDocument format, the new international standard for office documents. This XML based format means you&rsquo;re not tied in to Writer. You can access your documents from any OpenDocument compliant software.</p>
<p><em>.docx &amp; .doc support</em> - Writer can of course read all your older Microsoft Word documents, or save your work in Microsoft Word format for sending to people who are still using Microsoft products. Writer can also open .docx files created with Microsoft Office 2007 or Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac OS X.</p>

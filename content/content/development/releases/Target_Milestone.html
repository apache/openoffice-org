<h1>Target Milestones in Openoffice.org</h1>
"Target Milestone" shows the OOo version, in which a RESOLUTION for the
problem in the issue should be included. The contents of the "Target
Milestone" can be changed by QA member of developers. For FIXED issue
the developer/QA member will set the content of the "Target Milestone"
to the version where the fix will be included. The issue will be
verified before integration to the "Target Milestone" codeline. Once
the
fix has been confirmed as integrated on this "Target Milestone" the
issue can be closed.<br>

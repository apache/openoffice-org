<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-GeneralRemarks"></A>General
Remarks</H2>
<P>The Apache OpenOffice 3.4 features can be split into two stages:
changes already made in the OpenOffice.org beta, and additional
changes made at Apache since incubation started. During both stages
many small bugs were fixed and we can't honestly summarize the huge
help provided by our development community.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-NewFeaturesfromtheOpenOffice.org3.4beta"></A>
New Features from the OpenOffice.org 3.4 beta</H2>
<P>These features were already part of the OpenOffice.org 3.4 beta.
The 3.4 beta was built from the OOO340 code line which was cloned
from DEV300m106. This code line is the base for the Apache OpenOffice
code.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-FasterStartup"></A>Faster
Startup</H3>
<P>Startup is faster since the program now has enough initial
knowledge about its components so that it doesn't have to start each
of them.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-ImprovedODF1.2encryptionsupport"></A>
Improved ODF 1.2 encryption support</H3>
<P>The ODF 1.2 specification allows optional use of W3C-specified
algorithms in the encryption (password-protection) of ODF 1.2
documents.</P>
<P>For Apache OpenOffice 3.4, the default &quot;Save with Password&quot;
continues to use SHA1 digests and Blowfish encryption, the one
combination that is supported for interchange of encrypted documents
across ODF 1.0/1.1 and ODF 1.2 supporting application.</P>
<P>In addition, documents encrypted using AES256 are now recognized
and decrypted when the correct password is provided.</P>
<P>It is also possible to select AES256 for encrypting &quot;Save
with Password&quot; documents by setting both of these configuration
options:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Set configuration option
	org.openoffice.Office.Common/Save/ODF/UseSHA1InODF12 to &quot;false&quot;.
		</P>
	<LI><P>Set confguration option
	org.openoffice.Office.Common/Save/ODF/UseBlowfishInODF12 to &quot;false&quot;.
		</P>
</UL>
<P>A macro to set the options on or off is available at
<A HREF="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/User:TJFrazier/Encryption">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/User:TJFrazier/Encryption</A>.</P>
<P>The configuration options have no effect when saving in ODF
1.1/ODF 1.0 format.</P>
<P>See
<A HREF="http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/csprd03/OpenDocument-v1.2-csprd03-part3.html">http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/csprd03/OpenDocument-v1.2-csprd03-part3.html</A>
for precise details of the ODF 1.2 provisions.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Spreadsheet%3ATIMEfunctionreturnsvalues00%3A00%3A00%3C%3Dx%3C%3D23%3A59%3A59.999"></A>
Spreadsheet: TIME function returns values 00:00:00 &lt;= x &lt;=
23:59:59.999</H3>
<P>The TIME spreadsheet function returns values between 00:00:00 and
23:59:59.999... inclusive and wraps values equal to or greater than
24:00:00.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Spreadsheet%3ARenamed%22DataPilot%22to%22PivotTable%22"></A>
Spreadsheet: Renamed &quot;DataPilot&quot; to &quot;Pivot Table&quot;</H3>
<P>In the Spreadsheet GUI, the term &quot;DataPilot&quot; has been
replaced with the term &quot;Pivot Table&quot;.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-PivotTablehasbeenextended"></A>
PivotTable has been extended</H3>
<P>PivotTable (formerly known as DataPilot) is no longer limited in
the number of fields supported.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Spreadsheet%3ANewCSVexportoption%2C%22Quotealltextcells%22"></A>
Spreadsheet: New CSV export option, &quot;Quote all text cells&quot;</H3>
<P>Previously, in Spreadsheet CSV export, all content from text cells
was quoted with the selected text delimiter. Now this is optional and
happens only if the new check box &quot;Quote all text cells&quot; is
selected. By default, the text delimiter is added only if the cell
content contains the field delimiter, text delimiter or multiple
lines. When a CSV file is loaded and saved again without editing the
filter settings, the import option &quot;Quoted field as text&quot;
is used for the &quot;Quote all text cells&quot; option. The default
for &quot;Quoted field as text&quot; is now &quot;off&quot; (but if
it's changed in the import dialog, that is still saved as new default
in the configuration).</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-ImprovedCSVexport"></A>
Improved CSV export</H3>
<P>Better interoperability with other applications supporting the
import of CSV (Comma Separated Values) files as the style for
exporting strings is configurable now.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Spreadsheet%3AUnlimitednumberoffieldsinPivotTablelayoutdialog"></A>
Spreadsheet: Unlimited number of fields in Pivot Table layout dialog</H3>
<P>In the Pivot Table layout dialog, it is now possible to add more
than 8 fields to the &quot;Row Fields&quot;, &quot;Column Fields&quot;,
and &quot;Data Fields&quot; areas, and more than 10 fields to the
&quot;Page Fields&quot; area.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-MailMerge%3AScanrowsforcorrecttypeinformationforTextdatabases"></A>
MailMerge: Scan rows for correct type information for Text databases</H3>
<P>The MaxRowScan setting allows the user to define how many rows
should be scanned to find the correct type of a column. In the past
only the first row was scanned.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Math%3Anewoptiontosaveonlyusedsymbolsforeachformula"></A>
Math: new option to save only used symbols for each formula</H3>
<P>In order to save on document file size (namely in Writer documents
with many formulas) there is now a new option to save only those
symbols that are used in a formula. By default this option will be
active. Geek info: However there is a small drawback:&nbsp;
Previously, if you worked with different office installations,
documents with formulas could be used to implicitly import <B>ALL</B>
user-defined symbols in Math from one office installation to the
next, even if none of them got used in a formula. Since now only the
actually used symbols get saved, only those can be implicitly
imported into a different office installation. To get the old
behavior, simply turn off this new option.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Formula%3AAutomaticbaselineforMathobjects"></A>
Formula: Automatic baseline for Math objects</H3>
<P>There is a new check-box named 'Math baseline alignment' available
in the 'Formatting Aids' tab of the Writer and WriterWeb option
pages. When this option gets checked then <B>ALL</B> Math OLE objects
already existing in the Writer document that are anchored 'as
character' (and only those with this anchor type) will be
automatically aligned to match the baseline of the formula with the
one of the surrounding text. Also new Math objects inserted later on
will be automatically aligned as well. As long as this option is
active, manual movement of Math objects that are anchored 'as
character' is not possible, and thus vertical alignment in the
'Object' context dialog is now disabled as well. For new documents
this option is set by default. When loading old documents it is not
set. In any case, once a document gets saved again, the current value
of this option will be saved along with the document. This automatic
baseline alignment was implemented by Michal Spisiak as part of this
year's Google Summer of Code; the mentor for this was Eric Bachard.
Thanks to both of them!</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-NewFeaturesforApacheOpenOffice3.4"></A>
New Features for Apache OpenOffice 3.4</H2>
<P>These features are the result of the work at Apache on OpenOffice
since the OpenOffice.org 3.4 beta:</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-LicenseChange"></A>License
Change</H3>
<P>The License has changed to our simpler, non-restrictive, <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache
License 2</A>. The Apache License will make adoption, distribution
and modification of the software easier for all users and developers.
Of course the software remains free, and the source code with its
updates will continue to be available through the Apache Software
Foundation servers.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Misc.Updates."></A>Misc.
Updates.</H3>
<P>In accordance to the new license all the software components have
been updated to use licenses that are in line with ASF guidelines. No
critical functionality was lost, and we did update many libraries
that will work better on most situations. Many internal libraries and
headers were updated with modern versions that provide the same or
superior functionality. On selected platforms the &quot;Liberation&quot;
fonts were replaced with the improved Google Chrome fonts.</P>
<P>We strongly recommend that all developers and distributors update
to this release to avoid risks resulting from inconsistencies (IP and
security issues) found in previous versions of the OpenOffice.org
suite.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Calc%3AFasterLPsolver."></A>
Calc: Faster LP solver.</H3>
<P>The previous Linear Programming solver has been replaced with the
faster and better designed CoinMP from the Computational
Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) project.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-ApacheTomcatupdated."></A>
Apache Tomcat updated.</H3>
<P>The Apache Tomcat servlet was updated from the older version
5.0.30 to version 5.5.35 which brings in years of performance and
security improvements without changing the API. We plan to continue
updating components without causing any regression on the current
code.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-SupportforLineCapProperty"></A>
Support for Line Cap Property</H3>
<P>Now you can add a cap to the end of a line. Such caps are not only
known in the ODF1 .2 standard but in HTML5 and SVG too. Also other
Office Suites provide caps in different styles to be added to thick
lines.</P>
<P>Three styles exist:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">without a cap, called 'Butt' in
	programming and 'Flat' in UI (as in MS Office) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">with a round cap, called 'Round' 
	</P>
	<LI><P>with a rectangle cap, called 'Square' The property value
	'Flat' corresponds to the old behavior and is now the default. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/27835830/LineCap_PureLines.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1326743596000" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=1></FONT></P>
<P>The caps are added to the lines, so that the total length of the
lines increases with two-times a half line width.</P>
<P>Select the value from a drop-down-list in the line property
dialog, just beside the settings for corner style. The new property
is only available in contexts, where the corner style is active too.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/27835830/LineCap_Dialog.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1326743596000" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=1></FONT></P>
<P>If a line is dashed, the single dashes get caps too. Hereby a dot
is treated as dash. You can style not only pure lines and curves, but
the border of graphic objects as well.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/27835830/LineCap_BorderlineDotted.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1326743596000" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=1></FONT>

<P>The next example shows the new property applied to a connector.
Left side without cap, in the middle with 'round' cap, and on the
right side with 'square' cap.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/27835830/LineCap_CapOnConnectors.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1326743595000" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=1></FONT></P>
<P>The caps are available for 3D-objects too, when you turn on lines
and make them thick. The example shows lines, which are styled to
look “dotted”.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/27835830/LineCap_SphereDotted.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1326743638000" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=1></FONT>
and a zoom… 
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/download/attachments/27835830/LineCap_SphereZoom.png?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1326743638000" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=75 HEIGHT=38 BORDER=1></FONT></P>
<P>Linecaps defined in svg-graphics are supported, so that those
graphics look the same as they do in modern browsers.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-SupportforsheartransformationsforGraphicObjects%28Blogentry%29https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.apache.org%2FOOo%2Fentry%2Ffeaturesforgraphicobjectsandoleobjects"></A>
Support for shear transformations for GraphicObjects <A HREF="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/features_for_graphicobjects_and_oleobjects">(Blog
entry)</A></H3>
<P>GraphicObjects which get created when inserting graphics in
Draw/Impress and Spreadsheet support now not only rotation but also
shear, slant and distort. The visualization during interactions was
improved, also the break for vector-based GraphicObjects to draw
objects was improved. Writer has its own GraphicObjects; the ones
from the other applications can be copied to it as workaround.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-SupportforattributesandtransformationsforOLEObjects%28Blogentry%29https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.apache.org%2FOOo%2Fentry%2Ffeaturesforgraphicobjectsandoleobjects"></A>
Support for attributes and transformations for OLEObjects <A HREF="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/features_for_graphicobjects_and_oleobjects">(Blog
entry)</A></H3>
<P>OLEObjects (OLE is for Object Linking and Embedding) in
Draw/Impress and Spreadsheet support now all draw attributes and
geometrical transformations. They can have line style, fill style,
shadow and text. They support all transformations, e.g. rotations and
shear. This is handy for e.g. having a mathematical formula shown
rotated by 90 degrees or adding a border to a chart. Break to draw
objects is also enhanced.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-EnhancedcropsupportforGraphicalObjects"></A>
Enhanced crop support for GraphicalObjects</H3>
<P>Crop for GraphicObjects now works correctly together with
horizontal and/or vertical mirroring in all applications.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-SupportforScalableVectorGraphics%28SVG%29%28Blogentry%29https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.apache.org%2FOOo%2Fentry%2Fnativesvgsupportforapache"></A>
Support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) <A HREF="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/native_svg_support_for_apache">(Blog
entry)</A></H3>
<P>SVG is now supported as content for GraphicObjects in all
applications. The new implemented generic SVG interpreter supports
SVG format 1.1. The geometric content is internally processed as
vector data in all usages, e.g. PDF export and printing, which
guarantees good visualization quality. SVG graphics can be broken to
draw objects and be processed further.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-SupportforMultiImageinODF"></A>
Support for MultiImage in ODF</H3>
<P>For SVG support it was necessary to allow multiple image
representations for one GraphicObject to be present in the ODF file
format, e.g. a pixel graphic and the original SVG is written in case
of a GraphicObject with SVG content. This allows it to stay
compatible with other and older ODF supporting applications. The
number of images for one GraphicObject is not limited: applications
using this may choose the image with the format which supports its
purpose best, e.g, prefer to use a pixel graphic for ODF viewers.
OpenOffice 3.4 uses a weighting function which prefers pixel images
with transparency over such without and vector formats over pixel
formats.</P>

Enhanced chart visualization</H3>
<P>The visualization quality of charts has been enhanced by using a
new mechanism for more direct visualization. This increases speed,
reduces memory usage and enhances chart visualization in all
visualizations, including PDF export and printing.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Writer%3AAsianLanguageWordCount"></A>
Writer: Asian Language Word Count</H3>
<P>The word count of Asian languages is now correct. Previous
releases were counting terms instead of words when counting words of
Asian language text. Notice that file word count will not be
automatically updated for existing text documents. You need to make a
change to the document in order to force an update of the file word
count.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-Newregularexpressions%28regexp%29engine"></A>
New regular expressions (regexp) engine</H3>
<P>The existing regular expression engine has been replaced by the
ICU engine. This solves several bugs in &quot;Find and Replace&quot;
with the old implementation and speeds up the search.</P>
<P>The new engine also offers better standards compliance especially
regarding Unicode, which also means that some non-standard syntax
extensions like <TT CLASS="western">\&lt;</TT> and <TT CLASS="western">\&gt;</TT>
for word boundary matching are now deprecated. For the convenience of
a smooth upgrade experience they get emulated by the <TT CLASS="western">\b</TT>
operator though.</P>
<P>See <A HREF="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp#TOC-Regular-Expression-Metacharacters">ICU
regex syntax</A> for expressions supported in the new regular
expression engine. It is recommended to stay on the common ground
though and <A HREF="http://www.regular-expressions.info/refflavors.html">regex
flavors</A> gives an overview where this common ground is. The
modified syntax applies to macros too: regular expressions in macros
that were relying on the deprecated syntax should be converted to use
widely supported regex expressions.</P>
<P>Users of Japanese scripts should be aware that several non-trivial
transliterations could behave slightly differently, especially when
transliteration rules like &quot;ProlongedSoundMark&quot;,
&quot;IterationMark&quot;, &quot;Ignore-Width&quot;, &quot;BaFa&quot;,
&quot;SeZe&quot;, &quot;HyuByu&quot;, &quot;IandEfollowedByYa&quot;
or &quot;KiKuFollowedBySa&quot; might be involved.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="AOO3.4ReleaseNotes-NewColorPickerdialog"></A>
New Color Picker dialog</H3>
<P>The old color picker which is used in the office code for over a
decade has been replaced by a new, more intuitive one which offers a
wide variety of color selection possibilities. This feature was
developed by Christian Lippka; kudos to him for offering it under
Apache License. A picture says more than words.</P>

   <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

   <h3>Browser Cache</h3>

   <p>When using this site, make sure that your browser cache is not set to zero (0). A zero cache setting can make the site difficult to use. For example, if you enter an issue and hit submit without filling out a required field, Issuezilla tells you to hit the "Back" button so you can fill in the missing field; however, with a zero cache, all the fields you entered are cleared and you will have to reenter everything.</p>

   <h3>Email Bouncing</h3>

   <p>Maillist managers may periodically receive the following email error message from the Postmaster:</p>

   <dl>
    <dd><em>Error: Mailbox full</em></dd>

    <dd><em>Deposit failed</em></dd>

    <dd><em>The maximum number of email messages for this mailbox is reached</em></dd>
   </dl>

   <p>This error will generally occur with messages addressed to mailboxes that are checked infrequently. If this becomes a problem, you may choose to unsubscribe the user from the mail list. In the event the user subscribed to the maillist is using an alias, you may have to work with the postmater of their mail server to identify the originating subscriber.</p>

   <h3>Printing</h3>

   <p>Netscape 4.x and earlier browsers are not capable of omitting frame and navigation elements when the print function is initiated.</p>

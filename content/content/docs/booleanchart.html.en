   <h2>Using the Boolean chart</h2>

   <p>The Issuezilla query page allows you to define your search parameters by all fields in the Issue database. To limit your search to a specific set of values in those fields, you can use the "Boolean chart" at the bottom of the page.</p>

   <p>Each Boolean chart can contain one or more <i>terms</i> - the fields/values to search by and how each should be treated - and Boolean operators - either <i>AND</i> or <i>OR</i>.</p>

   <p>To define a term, select an item from each pulldown box, specifying the field and the type of match, and enter a value in the data field. For example, if you select <b>Issue #</b> from the first pulldown, <b>equal to</b> from the second pulldown, and enter 001 in the data field, you will see only issue #001 in your search results.</p>

   <p>The Boolean operators, i.e. the <b>And</b> button and the <b>Or</b> button, allow you to search by multiple terms.</p>

   <p>Clicking the <b>And</b> button allows you to define a new term and have the result of the query include anything that matches <i>both</i> of the terms.</p>

   <p>Clicking the <b>Or</b> button allows you to define a new term and the result of the query will be anything that matches <i>either</i> of the terms.</p>

   <p>You can add as many terms as you like by clicking the <b>And</b> or <b>Or</b> button after each term. You can also use both <b>And</b> and <b>Or</b> in a single query. Terms separated by <b>Or</b> are treated as a single statement. Terms separated by <b>And</b> are treated as separate statements. For example, you could search for all <i>P1</i> and <i>P2</i> issues with a status <i>New</i> or <i>Pending</i>. Your Boolean chart would look like this:</p>

   <p>Status Equal to New <em>OR</em> Status Equal to Pending</p>

   <p><em>AND</em></p>

   <p>Priority Equal to P2 <em>OR</em> Priority Equal to P1</p>

   <p>You can use the <b>Add another Boolean chart</b> button to search for multiple instances of a field that can have several entries associated with a single issue. For example all of the <i>changed</i>... match types and fields like <b>IssuesThisDependsOn</b>, <b>Comments</b>, and <b>CC,</b> etc. can have several entries in a single issue. If you have multiple terms in your search that refer to one field, they will always return the same instance unless the terms appear on different charts.</p>

   <p>For example, if you search for "Priority <i>changed to</i> P5 <b>And</b> Priority <i>changed by</i> person@addr," your results would include only issues where the person@addr changed the Priority to P5. However, if you want to find all issues for which person@addr changed the priority, and for which the priority was changed to P5 by anyone, you would put the two terms in two different charts that would look like this:</p>

   <p>Priority Changed by person@addr</p>

   <p>Priority Changed to P5</p>

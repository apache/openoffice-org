<h3><a name="1">1. Add a selection option for 'Document Style' to
cover whole document.</a></h3>
<p>We need to add user selection for a 'Document Style' to apply to
a whole document. I see two options for doing this -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adding a new tab-panel 'Document Styles' to
File&gt;Properties.<br>
 or</p></li>
<li>
<p>Adding a new tab-panel 'Document Styles' to Format&gt;Page.
(Does Page format only apply to the current section or the whole
document ?)</p></li></ol>
<p>This tab-panel would contain a 'Document Style' selection list
which include the supported styles eg APA, ASA, Chicago, MLA,
German DIN, French ISO, etc. {need to collect full list.}. Also we
need provision for the users to create their own styles. (See the
list of BibTeX supported styles <a href="bibtex-defs.html">BibTeX
supported styles.)</a></p>
<h4><a name="1.1">1.1</a>. Document Style Options</h4>
<p>Other options in the tab panel could be such things as -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Style Data import / export; (Endnote <sup>(TM)</sup> provides
style definitions to the general public which could be imported if
their import format was decoded)</p></li>
<li>
<p>'Strictly Enforce Style' (Y/N), This would prevent the user
modifying the document style aspects defined by the Style Manual.
This could make the OO word processor easier to use as many of the
functions would be grayed-out. The user would not be so bewildered
with choice. The user could at any time turn off 'Strictly Enforce
Style', and have access to all settings.</p></li></ul>
<p>There would also need to be provision for options which are
provided by the selected style that the user can choose. Eg. The
Chicago Style allows selection of either in-text, footnote or
endnotes, or a dual footnote comments endnote citation scheme.
Perhaps a 'Style Option' tab would handle this.</p>
<p>The information associated with Document Style would include the
following methods for Bibliographic citation -</p>
<ul>
<li>in-text</li>
<li>footnotes</li>
<li>endnotes</li>
<li>endnotes and footnotes. (requires symbols detailed in item 2
the field formats for Bibliographic citation and Bibliographic
Tables (Reference Lists and Bibliographic Lists).</li>
<li>special editing for Bibliographic Tables eg repeated author
names indicated by a three-em dash eg. (they should be a continious
line not dashes)-</li></ul>
<blockquote><font>Charles Dickens, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
(London:Penguin Books, 2000)<br>
 <span style="font-family: courier">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<i>Nicholas Nickelby,</i> (London: Penguin Classics, 1956)<br>
 <span style="font-family: courier">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, (New York, Random
House,1965)</font></blockquote>
<br>
 
<h4>1.2. Other Style considerations</h4>
<p>Page formating constraints (the MLA Manual specifies page
margins (need to check details)<br>
There may be particular requirements for Section, Chapter and
Heading styles.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#Project">Top of Page</a></div>
<h4>1.3. Conversion code</h4>
<p>When a new 'Document Style' was selected there would need to be
some format conversion process that would be applied to an existing
document. This would change the citation style from the current to
the new, the trickiest ones to do would be 'author-date in-text' to
footnote or endnote or visa versa.</p>
<p>An Issue: In order to allow a user change citation methods it
will be necessary to consider how we treat the footnote entry. It
seems to me there are two options. Utilise the standard footnote
entry code, or to have a special citation footnote.</p>
<h3><a name="2">2. Revert to declared style</a></h3>
<p>Is there a 'revert to declared style' function in OpenOffice ?
In MS Word there is a function that resets text to the declared
format. It removes all user made minor adjustments with fonts,
margins etc. This facility is probably required to make the above
work and very useful in it own right.</p>
<h3><a name="3">3. And symbols to the automatic footnote numbering
scheme.</a></h3>
<p>The Chicago Manual of Style stipulates that when Endnotes and
Footnotes are both used the Endnotes are consecutively numbered
(1,2,3 ...) and for the Footnotes symbols are to be used. The
series they suggest are -</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img src=
"./detailed%20enhacement%20proposals._html_3d82b501.gif" name=
"Graphic1" alt="a list of symbols like # * ect." align="left"
     width="188" height="47" border="0"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>As more symbols are needed they are doubled and trebled
-</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=
"./detailed%20enhacement%20proposals._html_2a5ae028.gif" name=
"Graphic2" alt="a list of symbols like ## ** ### *** ect."
     align="left" width="570" height="50" border="0"><br clear=
     "left"></td></tr></tbody></table>
The proposal is to add this set of symbols to the automatic
numbering options for footnotes. 
<p>The processing of the footnotes will need to be adjusted for
symbols, as the symbol sequence is restarted at the initial symbol
( * ), for each new page they are use on.</p>
<h3><a name="4">4.</a> Adapt the Field editor for the bibliography
table for the bibliographic citation fields.</h3>
The current Insert&gt;Indexes and Tables&gt;'Bibliographic Entry'
mechanism [<a href="biblio1_html_4a7d5d98.png">screen image</a>]
which is use to select fields and format Tables [including the
bibliographic table] should be extended to defining citation
fields. Currently Bibliographic Entry has only two options
available - selection from bibliographic database or document
content. Then there is the selection box for the 'short name';
which is the reference string to be inserted with the text, eg.
[CharlesE1978]. This mechanism needs to be extended to the footnote
or endnote method. These methods require this information in a more
complex format in a footnote or endnote; for
example<sup>34</sup>,<br>
 
<blockquote><font>34. T.M. Charles-Edwards,"Honour and status in
Some Irish and Welsh Prose Tales.",<i>Eriu</i>, xxxvi,
1978.</font></blockquote>
<p>The Bibliographic Entry selection box should be changed from
'short name' to 'citation type' - Book, Article, Journal Article,
Collection etc. A new button 'Customise Citation Styles' would
bring up a new field selection and formating panel very similar
(maybe identical) to the table format editor. Note that the
Citation Style and style options will have been set in the new
File&gt;Properties tab-panel 'Document Styles' mentioned above at
section 1. Also the 'Customise Citation Styles' button would be
inoperative and greyed out if 'Strictly Enforce Style' is set to
'Yes', so as not mess up the style settings.</p>
<p>Note: when the citation formats are defined and provided for the
various Document Style Conventions the average user will not have
to use this. All the fields will be predefined.</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#Project">Top of Page</a></div>
<h3><a name="5">5</a>. Modify the &lsquo;Bibliographic
Entry&gt;Edit&rsquo; Panel to support appropriate field entry
options for the citation type selected.</h3>
<p>Currently the Insert&gt;Indexes and Tables&gt;Bibliographic
Entry&gt;Edit&gt;New Panel [<a href=
"biblio1_html_1bd246eb.gif">screen image</a>] offers a selection
box that allows the user to selection citation type from a pick
list eg Book, Article, Manual, Incollection etc. And is presented
with a selection of 29 fields in which to place their data. The
preferred action would be that the selection of a citation type
would indicate which fields are Required, Optional, or Ignored for
that citation type. See a screen-print of sixpack as an example of
such an <a href="sixpack.jpg">editor</a> .</p>

<h3><a name="6">6.</a> Defining citations and references different
treatment maybe needed for first and subsequent use of the
citation.</h3>
<p>There is a tedious and fault prone aspects of the footnote /
endnote citation method - the maintenance the Initial and
Subsequent citations in the correct order as one edits the text. In
the mad rush to complete the paper as the deadline approaches, a
piece of text is moved and the Initial Citation reference now comes
after the Subsequent reference, and the examiner gives you a red
mark.</p>
<p>I do not know enough about the internals of OpenOffice to
suggest how this would be implemented. Two options would be to
include a check after bibliographic entry or to check and adjust
when the update fields function is activated. This would require
the citation field to have an identifier which signified that a
citation's initial and subsequent appearances were related to the
same reference in order to check if the current Initial citation is
still the initial one after some text editing. That is not using
string matching but reference identifiers.</p>
<p>This also requires that with style that require it all of the
citation formats will have two versions; the full initial one and
the shorter subsequent one.</p>
<p>Example. An Initial Reference -</p>
<blockquote><font>'Oisin and Patrick' in <i>Irish Myths and
Legends</i>, Lady Gregory. (London: Running Press, 1989),
412-421.</font></blockquote>
<p>A Subsequent Reference -</p>
<blockquote><font>'Oisin and Patrick' in <i>Irish Myths and
Legends</i>, 450.</font></blockquote>
or just - 
<blockquote><font>'Oisin and Patrick', 25.</font></blockquote>
<h4>6.1. Some Implementation Issues</h4>
<p>In order to allow a user change citation methods it will be
necessary to consider how we treat the footnote / endnote entry. It
seems to me there are two options. Utilise the standard footnote /
endnote entry code, or to have a special citation footnote.</p>
<p>I will give some examples. A document has in-text author-date
citations. This is what is currently implemented. eg.</p>
<blockquote><font>The story of Finn (Gregory1989) is central to our
argument.</font>/</blockquote>
<p>We now change the citation setting to footnote method and it
deletes the In-text field, creates a footnote and places the
citation field into the footnote.</p>
<blockquote><font>The story of Finn<sup>1</sup> is central to our
argument.<br></font> -----<br>
 <font>1. Lady Gregory,<i>Irish Myths and Legends</i> ,. (London:
Running Press, 1989)</font></blockquote>
<p>This seems simple enough. But what happens if we are starting
with the footnote / endnote style, and change to the in-text style.
Will it be just as simple a matter to find all the bibliographic
entries, go to the footnote / endnote reference, delete the
footnote / endnote and insert a new in-text author-date citations?
What do we do if the user has added extra text into citation
footnote / endnote ? -</p>
<blockquote><font>1. Lady Gregory ,<i>Irish Myths and Legends</i>,.
(London: Running Press, 1989) Note that this was originally
published in 1903.</font></blockquote>
<p>Do we than leave the footnote / endnote with just the added
text? And deleted if there was no added text ?</p>
<blockquote><font>The story of Finn (Gregory1989) <sup>1</sup> is
central to our argument. eg.<br>
 -----</font><br>
 <font>1. Note that this was originally published in
1903.</font></blockquote>
As more symbols are needed they are doubled and trebled - The
proposal is to add this set of symbols to the automatic numbering
options for footnotes. 
<p>Would it help to have a special field for footnote / endnote or
citations, and if we did how do we deal with added comments? A user
writable text area with the citation field ?</p>

<h3><a name="7">7.</a> There needs to be a mechanism for
transferring the internal Document Bibliographic entries to and
from the database to allow import and export from OpenOffice.</h3>
<p>Currently if a users creates Bibliographic entries with the
Insert&gt;Indexes and tables&gt;Bibliographic Entry&gt;New
function, these entries can not be easily exported from the
document.</p>
<p>As the first priority there needs to be an export and import of
bibliographic data in the BibTeX format. As this is the most common
format and the one most other bibliographic tools will utilise.</p>
<h3><a name="8">8. Some of the Bibliographic Database fields need
to be increased in length.</a></h3>
<p>Some users have run into the field length limit of the varchar
datatype (or of the Input form). At least Title and Authors, and
possibly some others should be made longvarchar. Currently if the
user changes the field definitions in the database the
bibliographic functions - Bibliographic Entry, and Bibliographic
Table cease to work on the altered table. Some journal articles
have hundreds of authors !</p>
<h3><a name="9">9.</a> Should we persist with the DBASE
Bibliographic Database?</h3>
<p>Or, to replace it with storage in BibTeX format and utilise
other OpenSource (eg. sixpack or pybliographic) work (code or
design) for a BibTeX editor and browser. We should also check the
OpenOffice Database project for their view and plans.</p>
<h3><a name="10">10.</a> It would be nice to have search capability
to Internet Bibliographic Database</h3>
<p>P.S from an Institute of Biochemistry requested the ability to
connect and query on-line databases (like Medline), or at least
import records from saved queries. He wrote - "PubMed for example
would allow your browser to save the queries in several formats
that are easy to import."</p>
<h3><a name="11">11.</a> Can we Utilise other OpenSource
applications ?</h3>
<p>Decide if we want to provide support for or utilise OpenSource
bibliographic tools such as Latex/BibTeX, sixpack, bp, or
pybliographic to work with OpenOffice (they could provide
significant parts of the bibliographic functions).</p>
<p>It would not be difficult to provide interaction with sixpack
and or pybliographic (at least on Linux). If a Unix style pipe for
text input was developed for OpenOffice, this would allow the other
application to directly insert citations eg. [wilson2002] into the
text. Sixpack can produce a bibliographic reference table of the
cited works in html which could be imported into OpenOffice
Writer.</p>
<h3>12<a name="12"></a>. Issue Internal Representation of
Bibliographic Data</h3>
We may wish to utilise work already done on XML representation of
Bibliographic data see BiblioML - XML for UNIMARC Bibliographic

<h3><a name="13">13.</a> Develop style definition</h3>
Provide for collections of bibliographic field definitions that are
selected via a select document style option. Most of the styles are
already defined in the latex/BibTeX, but this is not a simple
format to extract information from them. 
<h4>13.1 BibTeX and conversion tools and General Information</h4>
<p>bp is a Perl library that is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let you quickly make tools to access bibliographies</li>
<li>Let you quickly make tools to access bibliographies</li>
<li>Let you access multiple bibliography formats transparently</li>
<li>Let you convert between formats</li>
<li>
<p>Let you convert between character sets</p></li></ul>
<p>Developer - 'My first goal when designing the [bp] package was
only the first -- I had written a number of tools that accessed my
BibTeX bibliographies, and I saw that I was reusing a lot of code.
So I decided to make a generic package to access BibTeX
bibliographies. About a year later I decided that it would be even
better if the package could read multiple formats, and convert
between them. The result is bp. Parts of the package are still
missing (namely documentation, automatic format recognition, and a
good set of utilities), but everything needed for a working system
exists'. Home Page <a href=

<h5><font><i>13.1.a Cl-BibTeX A BibTeX system in Common
Lisp</i></font></h5>
<p>Developer - 'This is a replacement for the BibTeX program in
Common Lisp. The aim is to enable the user to format bibliographic
entries using Common Lisp programs, rather than using the stack
language of BibTeX style files. A powerful tool is needed for
dealing with citations in scientific documents. BibTeX is good for
formatting bibliographies, but customizing the format is a pain
because it requires writing/changing a program in BAFLL (BibTeX
Anonymous Forth-Like Language -- Drew McDermott in
comp.lang.lisp)'; <a href=
"http://www.nongnu.org/cl-BibTeX/">http://www.nongnu.org/cl-BibTeX/</a></p>
<p>The rational for the program is that LISP is more comprehensible
and hence more easy to modify and develop new styles than the
original BibTeX language.</p>

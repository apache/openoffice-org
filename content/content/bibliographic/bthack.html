<h2>5 Bibliography-style hacking</h2>

<p align="right"><em>A printer friendly PDF version of this page is available
<ahref="index.pdf"><a href="bthack.pdf">bthack.pdf (84Kb)</a></em></p>

<p>This document starts (and ends) with Section&nbsp;<a
href="bthack.html#style">5</a>, because in reality it is the final section of
"BibTeXing''&nbsp;[<a href="bthack.html#btxdoc">4</a>], the general
documentation for . But that document was meant for all users, while this one
is just for style designers, so the two are physically separate. Still, you
should be completely familiar with &#x201c;BibTeXing'', and all references in
this document to sections and section numbers assume that the two documents
are one.</p>

<p>This section, along with the standard-style documentation file
<tt>btxbst.doc</tt>, should explain how to modify existing style files and to
produce new ones. If you're a serious style hacker you should be familiar
with van&nbsp;Leunen&nbsp;[<a href="bthack.html#van-leunen">7</a>] for points
of style, with Lamport&nbsp;[<a href="bthack.html#latex">3</a>] and
Knuth&nbsp;[<a href="bthack.html#texbook">2</a>] for formatting matters, and
perhaps with <i>Scribe</i>&nbsp;[<a href="bthack.html#scribe">6</a>] for
compatibility details. And while you're at it, if you don't read the great
little book by Strunk and White&nbsp;[<a
href="bthack.html#strunk-and-white">5</a>], you should at least look at its
entries in the database and the reference list to see how handles multiple
names.</p>

<p>To create a new style, it's best to start with an existing style that's
close to yours, and then modify that. This is true even if you're simply
updating an old style for version 0.99 (I've updated four nonstandard styles,
so I say this with some experience). If you want to insert into a new style
some function you'd written for an old (version 0.98i) style, keep in mind
that the order of the arguments to the assignment (<tt>:=</tt>) function has
been reversed. When you're finished with your style, you may want to try
running it on the entire <tt>XAMPL.BIB</tt> database to make sure it handles
all the standard entry types.</p>

<p>If you find any bugs in the standard styles, or if there are things you'd
like to do with bibliography-style files but can't, please complain to Oren
Patashnik.</p>

<h3>5.1 General description</h3>

<p>You write bibliography styles in a postfix stack language. It's not too
hard to figure out how by looking at the standard-style documentation, but
this description fills in a few details (it will fill in more details if
there's a demand for it).</p>

<p>Basically the style file is a program, written in an unnamed language,
that tells how to format the entries that will go in the reference list
(henceforth ``the entries'' will be ``the entry list'' or simply ``the
list'', context permitting). This programming language has ten commands,
described in the next subsection. These commands manipulate the language's
objects: constants, variables, functions, the stack, and the entry list.
(Warning: The terminology in this documentation, chosen for ease of
explanation, is slightly different from 's. For example, this documentation's
``variables'' and ``functions'' are both ``functions'' to . Keep this in mind
when interpreting 's error messages.)</p>

<p>There are two types of functions: <i>built-in</i> ones that provides
(these are described in Section&nbsp;<a
href="bthack.html#built-in-fns">5.3</a>), and ones you define using either
the <tt>MACRO</tt> or <tt>FUNCTION</tt> command.</p>

<p>Your most time-consuming task, as a style designer, will be creating or
modifying functions using the <tt>FUNCTION</tt> command (actually, becoming
familiar with the references listed above will be more time consuming, but
assume for the moment that that's done).</p>

<p>Let's look at a sample function fragment. Suppose you have a string
variable named <tt>label</tt> and an integer variable named
<tt>lab.width</tt>, and suppose you want to append the character `<tt>a</tt>'
to <tt>label</tt> and to increment <tt>lab.width</tt>:</p>
<pre>    .  .  .
    label "a" * 'label :=          % label := label * "a"
    lab.width #1 + 'lab.width :=   % lab.width := lab.width + 1
    .  .  .</pre>

<p>In the first line, <tt>label</tt> pushes that variable's value onto the
stack. Next, the <tt>"a"</tt> pushes the string constant `<tt>a</tt>' onto
the stack. Then the built-in function <tt>*</tt> pops the top two strings and
pushes their concatenation. The <tt>'label</tt> pushes that variable's name
onto the stack. And finally, the built-in function <tt>:=</tt> pops the
variable name and the concatenation and performs the assignment treats the
stuff following the <tt>%</tt> as a comment in the style file. The second
line is similar except that it uses <tt>#1</tt>, with no spaces intervening
between the `<tt>#</tt>' and the `<tt>1</tt>', to push this integer
constant.</p>

<p>The nonnull spacing here is arbitrary: multiple spaces, tabs, or newlines
are equivalent to a single one (except that you're probably better off not
having blank lines within commands, as explained shortly).</p>

<p>For string constants, absolutely any printing character is legal between
two consecutive double quotes, but here (and only here) treats upper- and
lower-case equivalents as different. Furthermore, spacing <i>is</i> relevant
within a string constant, and you mustn't split a string constant across
lines (that is, the beginning and ending double quotes must be on the same
line).</p>

<p>Variable and function names may not begin with a numeral and may not
contain any of the ten restricted characters on page&nbsp;143 of the
L<sup>A</sup>TEX book, but may otherwise contain any printing characters.
Also, considers upper- and lower-case equivalents to be the same.</p>

<p>Integers and strings are the only value types for constants and variables
(booleans are implemented simply as 0-or-1 integers). There are three kinds
of variables:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>global&nbsp;variables</strong></dt>
    <dd>These are either integer- or string-valued, declared using an
      <tt>INTEGERS</tt> or <tt>STRINGS</tt> command.</dd>
  <dt><strong>entry&nbsp;variables</strong></dt>
    <dd>These are either integer- or string-valued, declared using the
      <tt>ENTRY</tt> command. Each has a value for each entry on the list
      (example: a variable <tt>label</tt> might store the label string you'll
      use for the entry).</dd>
  <dt><strong>fields</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>These are string-valued, read-only variables that store the
      information from the database file; their values are set by the
      <tt>READ</tt> command. As with entry variables, each has a value for
      each entry.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>5.2 Commands</h3>

<p>There are ten style-file commands: Five (<tt>ENTRY</tt>,
<tt>FUNCTION</tt>, <tt>INTEGERS</tt>, <tt>MACRO</tt>, and <tt>STRINGS</tt>)
declare and define variables and functions; one (<tt>READ</tt>) reads in the
database information; and four (<tt>EXECUTE</tt>, <tt>ITERATE</tt>,
<tt>REVERSE</tt>, and <tt>SORT</tt>) manipulate the entries and produce
output. Although the command names appear here in upper case, ignores case
differences.</p>

<p>Some restrictions: There must be exactly one <tt>ENTRY</tt> and one
<tt>READ</tt> command; the <tt>ENTRY</tt> command, all <tt>MACRO</tt>
commands, and certain <tt>FUNCTION</tt> commands (see next subsection's
description of <tt>call.type$</tt>) must precede the <tt>READ</tt> command;
and the <tt>READ</tt> command must precede the four that manipulate the
entries and produce output.</p>

<p>Also it's best (but not essential) to leave at least one blank line
between commands and to leave no blank lines within a command; this helps
recover from any syntax errors you make.</p>

<p>You must enclose each argument of every command in braces. Look at the
standard-style documentation for syntactic issues not described in this
section. Here are the ten commands:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><tt><strong>ENTRY</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd><p>Declares the fields and entry variables. It has three arguments,
      each a (possibly empty) list of variable names. The three lists are of:
      fields, integer entry variables, and string entry variables. There is
      an additional field that</p>
    </dd>
    <dd><p>automatically declares, <tt>crossref</tt>, used for cross
      referencing. And there is an additional string entry variable
      automatically declared, <tt>sort.key$</tt>, used by the <tt>SORT</tt>
      command. Each of these variables has a value for each entry on the
      list.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>EXECUTE</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Executes a single function. It has one argument, the function
    name.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>FUNCTION</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Defines a new function. It has two arguments; the first is the
      function's name and the second is its definition. You must define a
      function before using it; recursive functions are thus illegal.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>INTEGERS</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Declares global integer variables. It has one argument, a list of
      variable names. There are two such automatically-declared variables,
      <tt>entry.max$</tt> and <tt>global.max$</tt>, used for limiting the
      lengths of string variables. You may have any number of these commands,
      but a variable's declaration must precede its use.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>ITERATE</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Executes a single function, once for each entry in the list, in the
      list's current order (initially the list is in citation order, but the
      <tt>SORT</tt> command may change this). It has one argument, the
      function name.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>MACRO</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Defines a string macro. It has two arguments; the first is the
      macro's name, which is treated like any other variable or function
      name, and the second is its definition, which must be
      double-quote-delimited. You must have one for each three-letter month
      abbreviation; in addition, you should have one for common journal
      names. The user's database may override any definition you define using
      this command. If you want to define a string the user can't touch, use
      the <tt>FUNCTION</tt> command, which has a compatible syntax.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>READ</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Dredges up from the database file the field values for each entry in
      the list. It has no arguments. If a database entry doesn't have a value
      for a field (and probably no database entry will have a value for every
      field), that field variable is marked as missing for the entry.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>REVERSE</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Exactly the same as the <tt>ITERATE</tt> command except that it
      executes the function on the entry list in reverse order.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>SORT</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Sorts the entry list using the values of the string entry variable
      <tt>sort.key$</tt>. It has no arguments.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>STRINGS</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd><p>Declares global string variables. It has one argument, a list of
      variable names. You may have any number of these commands, but a
      variable's declaration must precede its use.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>5.3 The built-in functions</h3>

<p>Before we get to the built-in functions, a few words about some other
built-in objects. There is one built-in string entry variable,
<tt>sort.key$</tt>, which the style program must set if the style is to do
sorting. There is one built-in field, <tt>crossref</tt>, used for the cross
referencing feature described in Section&nbsp;4. And there are two built-in
integer global variables, <tt>entry.max$</tt> and <tt>global.max$</tt>, which
are set by default to some internal constants; you should truncate strings to
these lengths before you assign to string variables, so as to not generate
any warning messages.</p>

<p>There are currently 37 built-in functions. Every built-in function with a
letter in its name ends with a `<tt>$</tt>'. In what follows, ``first'',
``second'', and so on refer to the order popped. A ``literal'' is an element
on the stack, and it will be either an integer value, a string value, a
variable or function name, or a special value denoting a missing field. If
any popped literal has an incorrect type,</p>

<p>complains and pushes the integer 0 or the null string, depending on
whether the function was supposed to push an integer or string.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><strong><tt>&gt;</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (integer) literals, compares them, and pushes the
      integer 1 if the second is greater than the first, 0 otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>&lt;</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Analogous.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>=</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (both integer or both string) literals, compares
      them, and pushes the integer 1 if they're equal, 0 otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>+</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (integer) literals and pushes their sum.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>-</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (integer) literals and pushes their difference (the
      first subtracted from the second).</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>*</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (string) literals, concatenates them (in reverse
      order, that is, the order in which pushed), and pushes the resulting
      string.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>:=</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two literals and assigns to the first (which must be a
      global or entry variable) the value of the second.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>add.period$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal, adds a `<tt>.</tt>' to it if the last
      non`<tt>}</tt>' character isn't a `<tt>.</tt>', `<tt>?</tt>', or
      `<tt>!</tt>', and pushes this resulting string.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>call.type$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Executes the function whose name is the entry type of an entry. For
      example if an entry is of type <tt>book</tt>, this function executes
      the <tt>book</tt> function. When given as an argument to the
      <tt>ITERATE</tt> command, <tt>call.type$</tt> actually produces the
      output for the entries. For an entry with an unknown type, it executes
      the function <tt>default.type</tt>. Thus you should define (before the
      <tt>READ</tt> command) one function for each standard entry type as
      well as a <tt>default.type</tt> function.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>change.case$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (string) literals; it changes the case of the second
      according to the specifications of the first, as follows. (Note: The
      word `letters' in the next sentence refers only to those at
      brace-level&nbsp;0, the top-most brace level; no other characters are
      changed, except perhaps for ``special characters'', described in
      Section&nbsp;4.) If the first literal is the string&nbsp;`<tt>t</tt>',
      it converts to lower case all letters except the very first character
      in the string, which it leaves alone, and except the first character
      following any colon and then nonnull white space, which it also leaves
      alone; if it's the string&nbsp;`<tt>l</tt>', it converts all letters to
      lower case; and if it's the string&nbsp;`<tt>u</tt>', it converts all
      letters to upper case. It then pushes this resulting string. If either
      type is incorrect, it complains and pushes the null string; however, if
      both types are correct but the specification string (i.e., the first
      string) isn't one of the legal ones, it merely pushes the second back
      onto the stack, after complaining. (Another note: It ignores case
      differences in the specification string; for example, the strings
      <tt>t</tt> and <tt>T</tt> are equivalent for the purposes of this
      built-in function.)</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>chr.to.int$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal, makes sure it's a single character,
      converts it to the corresponding ASCII integer, and pushes this
    integer.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>cite$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pushes the string that was the <code>\cite</code>-command argument
      for this entry.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>duplicate$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top literal from the stack and pushes two copies of it.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>empty$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top literal and pushes the integer 1 if it's a missing field
      or a string having no non-white-space characters, 0 otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>format.name$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top three literals (they are a string, an integer, and a
      string literal). The last string literal represents a name list (each
      name corresponding to a person), the integer literal specifies which
      name to pick from this list, and the first string literal specifies how
      to format this name, as explained in the next subsection. Finally, this
      function pushes the formatted name.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>if$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top three literals (they are two function literals and an
      integer literal, in that order); if the integer is greater than 0, it
      executes the second literal, else it executes the first.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>int.to.chr$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (integer) literal, interpreted as the ASCII integer
      value of a single character, converts it to the corresponding
      single-character string, and pushes this string.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>int.to.str$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (integer) literal, converts it to its (unique) string
      equivalent, and pushes this string.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>missing$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top literal and pushes the integer 1 if it's a missing
      field, 0&nbsp;otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>newline$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Writes onto the <tt>bbl</tt> file what's accumulated in the output
      buffer. It writes a blank line if and only if the output buffer is
      empty. Since <tt>write$</tt> does reasonable line breaking, you should
      use this function only when you want a blank line or an explicit line
      break.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>num.names$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal and pushes the number of names the
      string represents--one plus the number of occurrences of the substring
      ``and'' (ignoring case differences) surrounded by nonnull white-space
      at the top brace level.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>pop$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top of the stack but doesn't print it; this gets rid of an
      unwanted stack literal.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>preamble$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pushes onto the stack the concatenation of all the <tt>@PREAMBLE</tt>
      strings read from the database files.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>purify$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal, removes nonalphanumeric characters
      except for white-space characters and hyphens and ties (these all get
      converted to a space), removes certain alphabetic characters contained
      in the control sequences associated with a ``special character'', and
      pushes the resulting string.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>quote$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pushes the string consisting of the double-quote character.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>skip$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Is a no-op.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>stack$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops and prints the whole stack; it's meant to be used for style
      designers while debugging.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>substring$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top three literals (they are the two integers literals
      <i>len</i> and <i>start</i>, and a string literal, in that order). It
      pushes the substring of the (at most) <i>len</i> consecutive characters
      starting at the <i>start</i>th character (assuming 1-based indexing) if
      <i>start</i> is positive, and ending at the<i> start</i>th character
      from the end if <i>start</i> is negative (where the first character
      from the end is the last character).</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>swap$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Swaps the top two literals on the stack.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>text.length$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal, and pushes the number of text
      characters it contains, where an accented character (more precisely, a
      ``special character'', defined in Section&nbsp;4) counts as a single
      text character, even if it's missing its matching right brace, and
      where braces don't count as text characters.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>text.prefix$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two literals (the integer literal <i>len</i> and a
      string literal, in that order). It pushes the substring of the (at
      most) <i>len</i> consecutive text characters starting from the
      beginning of the string. This function is similar to
      <tt>substring$</tt>, but this one considers a ``special character'',
      even if it's missing its matching right brace, to be a single text
      character (rather than however many ASCII characters it actually
      comprises), and this function doesn't consider braces to be text
      characters; furthermore, this function appends any needed matching
      right braces.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>top$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops and prints the top of the stack on the terminal and log file.
      It's useful for debugging.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>type$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pushes the current entry's type (book, article, etc.), but pushes the
      null string if the type is either unknown or undefined.</dd>
  <dt><tt><strong>warning$</strong></tt></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal and prints it following a warning
      message. This also increments a count of the number of warning messages
      issued.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>while$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top two (function) literals, and keeps executing the second
      as long as the (integer) literal left on the stack by executing the
      first is greater than 0.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>width$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd>Pops the top (string) literal and pushes the integer that represents
      its width in some relative units (currently, hundredths of a point, as
      specified by the June 1987 version of the  font; the only white-space
      character with nonzero width is the space). This function takes the
      literal literally; that is, it assumes each character in the string is
      to be printed as is, regardless of whether the character has a special
      meaning to TEX, except that ``special characters'' (even without their
      right braces) are handled specially. This is meant to be used for
      comparing widths of label strings.</dd>
  <dt><strong><tt>write$</tt></strong></dt>
    <dd><p>Pops the top (string) literal and writes it on the output buffer
      (which will result in stuff being written onto the <tt>bbl</tt> file
      when the buffer fills up).</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the built-in functions <tt>while$</tt> and <tt>if$</tt> require
two function literals on the stack. You get them there either by immediately
preceding the name of a function by a single quote, or, if you don't feel
like defining a new function with the <tt>FUNCTION</tt> command, by simply
giving its definition (that is, giving what would be the second argument to
the <tt>FUNCTION</tt> command, including the surrounding braces). For example
the following function fragment appends the character `<tt>a</tt>' if the
string variable named <tt>label</tt> is nonnull:</p>
<pre>    .  .  .
    label "" =
      'skip$
      { label "a" * 'label := }
    if$
    .  .  .</pre>

<p>A function whose name you quote needn't be built in like <tt>skip$</tt>
above--it may, for example, be a field name or a function you've defined
earlier.</p>

<h3>5.4 Name formatting</h3>

<p>What's in a name? Section&nbsp;4 pretty much describes this. Each name
consists of four parts: First, von, Last, and Jr; each consists of a list of
name-tokens, and any list but Last's may be empty for a nonnull name. This
subsection describes the format string you must supply to the built-in
function <tt>format.name$</tt>.</p>

<p>Let's look at an example of a very long name. Suppose a database
entry&nbsp;[<a href="bthack.html#prime-number-theorem">1</a>] has the
field</p>
<pre>  author = "Charles Louis Xavier Joseph de la Vall{\'e}e Poussin"</pre>

<p>and suppose you want this formatted ``last name comma initials''. If you
use the format string</p>
<pre>    "{vv~}{ll}{, jj}{, f}?"</pre>

<p>will produce</p>
<pre>    de~la Vall{\'e}e~Poussin, C.~L. X.~J?</pre>

<p>as the formatted string.</p>

<p>Let's look at this example in detail. There are four brace-level&nbsp;1
<i>pieces</i> to this format string, one for each part of a name. If the
corresponding part of a name isn't present (the Jr part for this name),
everything in that piece is ignored. Anything at brace-level&nbsp;0 is output
verbatim (the presumed typo `<tt>?</tt>' for this name is at
brace-level&nbsp;0), but you probably won't use this feature much.</p>

<p>Within each piece a double letter tells to use whole tokens, and a single
letter, to abbreviate them (these letters must be at brace-level&nbsp;1);
everything else within the piece is used verbatim (well, almost
everything--read on). The tie at the end of the von part (in
<code>{vv~}</code>) is a discretionary tie-- will output a tie at that point
if it thinks there's a need for one; otherwise it will output a space. If you
really, really, want a tie there, regardless of what thinks, use two of them
(only one will be output); that is, use <code>{vv~~}</code>. A tie is
discretionary only if it's the last character of the piece; anywhere else
it's treated as an ordinary character.</p>

<p>puts default strings <i>between</i> tokens of a name part: For whole
tokens it uses either a space or a tie, depending on which one it thinks is
best, and for abbreviated tokens it uses a period followed by either a space
or a tie. However it doesn't use this default string after the last token in
a list; hence there's no period following the `J' for our example. You should
have used</p>
<pre>    "{vv~}{ll}{, jj}{, f.}" to get to produce the same formatted string but with the question mark replaced by a period. Note that the period should go inside the First-name piece, rather than where the question mark was, in case a name has no First part.</pre>

<p>If you want to override 's default between-token strings, you must
explicitly specify a string. For example suppose you want a label to contain
the first letter from each token in the von and Last parts, with no spaces;
you should use the format string</p>
<pre>    "{v{}}{l{}}"</pre>

<p>so that will produce `<tt>dlVP</tt>' as the formatted string. You must
give a string for each piece whose default you want overridden (the example
here uses the null string for both pieces), and this string must immediately
follow either the single or double letter for the piece. You may not have any
other letters at brace-level&nbsp;1 in the format string.</p>

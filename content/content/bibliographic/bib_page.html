<H2>Mission Statement</H2>
<DL>
	<DT>A number of different style conventions are in common use for
	the formatting of documents. These conventions use different formats
	for bibliographic citations and for reference tables. At present
	OpenOffice Writer provides support for only on of these conventions.
		</DT><DT>
	<BR>
	</DT><DT>
	This project has three objectives -</DT></DL>
<UL>
	<LI>
	to build support with OpenOffice for the formating requirements of
	all of the commonly used style conventions. 
	<LI>to develop a function which would enable the formate of a
	document to be changed form one style to another with minimal
	editing. 
	<LI><P>to develop a function which would allow easy import and
	export of bibliographic data between OpenOffice and bibliographic
	databases such as BibTeX.</P>
</UL>
<DL>
	<DT><BR>
	</DT><DT>
	If the project&rsquo;s objectives were achieved, it would be
	possible to convert a scientific, technical or academic paper to the
	style required by a different journal, simply by selecting the
	required style convention and then generating the new version. 
	</DT><DT>
	<BR>
	</DT><DT>
	So far as I know, no other WYSIWYG word processor can do this. Some
	(eg. Word for Windows with Endnote) may handle variations in the
	in-text citations of the author-date / author-number types, but not
	variations between in-text and footnote / endnote citations. [
	wysiwyg -- relating to or being a word processing system that prints
	the text exactly as it appears on the computer screen]</DT></DL>
<H2>
Background</H2>
<DL>
	<DT>Many institutions require their documents to conform to a
	specific Style Convention, which covers aspects of document format,
	including the styles of bibliographic tables and citations.
	[Citation: a short note recognizing a source of information or of a
	quoted passage.] There are a number of Style Conventions: these
	include MLA, ASA, PSA, Harvard, Chicago. These different styles
	differ in the way in which they present citations and references for
	different types of source documents, such as books, articles,
	journals, collections etc. If a document has been written with one
	Style Convention it is a laborious task to convert all these
	references to another style. The ideal would be a fully automated
	method of conversion. This project is working towards that. 
	</DT><DT>
	<BR>
	</DT><DT>
	LaTeX, with BibTeX, is the standard word processor in mathematics
	and the hard sciences. It can handle many types of bibliographic
	style conversions. OpenOffice will have to emulate LaTeX/BibTeX's
	flexibility in bibliographic styles (and in mathematic equations) if
	it is to gain acceptance in that field. 
	</DT><DT>
	<BR>
	</DT><DT>
	However, I believe that LaTeX / BibTeX can only handle in-text
	citations eg. [dwilson:2002] / [dwilson:1] and not of footnote /
	endnote citations. LaTeX is not WYSIWYG (even with it&rsquo;s GUI
	interface - Lyx). 
	</DT><DT>
	<BR>
	</DT><DT>
	OpenOffice's current functions are limited. At present there are two
	loosely coupled bibliographic facilities. One is the old StarOffice
	5.2 Bibliographic database (dbase format). It has a simple reference
	insertion process. When an database bibliographic entry is dragged
	onto a document, a dialog box opens which allows the fields required
	for the entry to be selected. This process can be configured for
	only one citation format in one citation style - eg book reference
	for MLA - and it does not support character formatting of fields,
	such as italic or underlining. The bibliographic database cannot
	import or export data in acceptable formats for other bibliographic
	applications. 
	</DT><DT>
	<BR>
	</DT><DT>
	The other facility in new in OpenOffice. It stores bibliographic
	data within the document. The data is entered through 'Insert
	&gt;Indexes and Tables&gt; Bibliographic Entry' function, and
	bibliographic tables can be generated from it. The new facility can
	also access the old bibliographic database. It allows Bibliographic
	citations to be selected either from the bibliographic database or
	from the &lsquo;document content' and inserted into the document.
	Selecting the 'From document content' option and pressing the New
	button adds bibliographic references as hidden fields. A
	Bibliographic Table can be inserted that utilised the citations from
	the database and / or the 'document content' . The format of the
	Bibliographic Table can be finely controlled (it has character
	formatting) and this is a very good piece of design and
	implementation. However, the citation and table field definitions
	can be set up to support only one Style Convention. To reset the
	table definitions for a different style is a laborious exercise.
	Another limitation is that only the in-text author-date [wilson2002]
	form of citation is properly supported: the footnote or endnote
	citation style is not supported. Another important limitation is
	that there is no capacity for in-document bibliographic data to be
	imported or exported. Nor can data be transferred between the
	internal document storage and the old database.</DT></DL>

Project Summary</H3>
<DL>
	<DT>As this project is just starting, the first steps are -</DT></DL>
<UL>
	<LI>
	To develop detailed requirements to achieve the objectives. 
	<LI>To check what existing OpenSource work could be of use - not
	reinventing the wheel. 
	<LI>To encourage developers to help with the project. 
	<LI>To gain an understanding of the implementation issues form the
	developers. 
	<LI>To undertake detailed specification and design work. 
	<LI><P>To work with the project managers and volunteers to get the
	development work done.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Areas of Work</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>We shall need to decide whether we want to provide support for
	or utilise OpenSource bibliographic tools such as LaTeX/BibTeX,
	sixpack, bp, or pybliographer to work with OpenOffice (they could
	provide significant parts of the bibliographic functions). It would
	not be difficult to provide interaction with these applications (at
	least on Linux). Support for a pipe and some text conversion code
	would be required in order to accept citation input from these
	applications. 
	<LI>Add a selection option for 'Document Style' to cover whole
	document. 
	<LI>Adapt the current Bibliography Table Field editor for the
	bibliographic citation fields. 
	<LI>Build support for the footnote and/or endnote citation methods. 
	<LI>Provide for collections of bibliographic field definitions that
	are selected via a &lsquo;Select Document Style&rsquo; option. Most
	of the styles are already defined in the BibTeX, but this is not a
	simple format from which to extract information. 
	<LI>Develop the processing to handle citations and references for
	styles that require different treatment for first and subsequent
	uses of the citation. 
	<LI>Develop the processing required to handle the conversion of one
	document style to an other. 
	<LI>Develop a mechanism for transferring the internal Document
	Bibliographic entries to and from the database. Also to allow import
	and export from OpenOffice. And, most importantly, to support import
	/ export of, or direct access to, BibTeX databases. 
	<LI>An import filter for LaTeX, would assist users of that word
	processor to move to OpenOffice. The text conversion would not be
	difficult, but converting the mathematical equations would be a bit
	more tricky. (see <A 
HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=10321">issue</A>
	) 
	<LI>Some of the Bibliographic Database fields (Author, Title, etc.)
	need to be increased in length. 
	<LI>Add symbols to the automatic footnote numbering scheme.(see
	<A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=9992">issue</A>)
	
	<LI>Develop a list of the Document Styles to be included, with
	details about each one. 
	<LI><P>We need more information about bibliographic requirements
	from Europe and Asia. (We have info on German JURABIB &amp; DIN
	1505, and French UNIMARK &amp; ISO2709)</P>
</UL>
<H3>Questions</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>Should we persist with the current DBASE Bibliographic Database?
	Or, replace it with storage in BibTeX format and utilise other
	OpenSource work (code or design) for a BibTeX editor and browser?
	(For example see a screen-print of <A HREF="sixpack.jpg">Sixpack</A>
	application) 
	<LI>When OpenOffice database project develops support for a SQL
	database, would there be any advantage of making use of it? 
	<LI><P>Could we decode the publicly available Endnote (TM) style
	definition files, and make use of them?</P>

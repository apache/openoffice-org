  <h3>About this Guide<a name="thisguide"></a></h3>
  <p><b>What this guide discusses</b>. The purpose of this guide is to
    enable users to tunnel to OpenOffice.org using SSH2 (Secure Shell 2). This
    guide provides instructions for the creating the certificate (also called
    the public key) used by SSH2 servers and for sending that certificate to
    the OpenOffice.org administrator. It will also then explain how to create
    a secure "tunnel" between your machine and OpenOffice.org using this certificate.
    (Throughout this discussion, the term "public key" and "certificate" will
    be used interchangeably.) This guide only seems long. Much of the material
    is repeated and tailored to suit the needs of particular clients.
  </p><p><b>What this guide does not discuss</b>. This guide does not explain in detail how
    to use CVS, only how to set up the tunnel so that you can use CVS. See the brief account of using CVS with a tunnel <a href="#cvs">below</a>.
  </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: In order to tunnel to OpenOffice.org, you must first
    submit a public key (certificate); it must then be accepted; it will only
    be accepted if you have the authorization of your project lead and have submitted
    either a Joint Copyright Assignment or Public Document License and your name
    is on the &quot;<a href="../copyright/copyrightapproved.html">Copyright Approved</a>&quot; list.
    For more information, see the <a href="../contributing.html">Contributing</a> page.</p>

  <h3>About SSH2</h3>
  <p>SSH2 is a flexible and more secure replacement for telnet and rlogin, and
    SSH1. It is widely used in development projects to provide access control
    and data-transport security. SSH2 can be used to create an unobtrusive, transparent "port
    tunnel" to the CVS (concurrent versions system) server. SSH2 uses encrypted
    certificates (a public/private key pair) to verify the user's identity and
    to transmit data. Data sent through the tunnel is encrypted, but the process
    is invisible to you or to the client software you are using to access the
    CVS repository. </p>
  <p>Because it is easy to use and very secure, OpenOffice.org uses SSH2 for
    developers accessing the CVS repository. </p>
  <a name="concepts"></a>
  <h3>Concepts</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Using the right software</li>
    <li>Creating the certificate</li>
    <li>Establishing the SSH2 tunnel</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Before you can establish an SSH2 connection, you have to find the right
    software, i.e., a client that places a terminal on your desktop, if you are
    using Windows or Mac OS 9 (Mac OS X has SSH2 capability built in). Fortunately,
    there are excellent clients that offer Windows and Mac OS users desktop terminals.
    The section below discusses them in detail. Of course, if you are using Linux
    (or some other Unix variant), then you can skip that section and go right
    to the section, <a href="#HowtoConnect">"Tunneling"</a> that describes the
    key elements in establishing an SSH2 tunnel in a Unix-like environment. And
    if you already are familiar with the these clients, then you can skip ahead
    to "<a href="#usingterminals">Using the Desktop Terminal</a>.&quot;</p>
  <p>Once you have obtained and configured a client terminal, you must
  </p><ol start="1">
    <li>Generate a public/private key pair (the certificate); and</li>
    <li>File an issue and attach the public key to the issue. Assign it to ssh2key@openoffice.org
      in the &quot;www&quot; component</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Generating the key is simple, and there are both commercially available
    and free clients that do the job for you. Sending the key then is only a
    matter of attaching it to an issue in which you explain which module you
    wish to access and assigning it to ssh2key@openoffice.org in the www.component. </p>
  <h3>The SSH2 Client<a name="choosing"></a></h3>
  <h4>Platforms<a name="platforms"></a></h4>
  <p><b>Command Line: Linux, Mac OS X, Unix, Solaris.<a name="commands"></a></b> Linux
    supports SSH. To connect using SSH, see the "Tunneling" section below. As
    well, Mac OS X, via the &quot;Terminal&quot; application, allows you to generate
    a key pair, and establish a tunnel. This is no surprise, as it is using tried-and-true
    software. To establish the tunnel, follow the instructions as for Linux,
    with the exception being that the command for generating the DSA key in BSD
    is different: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ssh-keygen -t dsa</font> (though
    I have found that<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> ssh-keygen -d also
    works</font>).</p>
  <p><b><a name="Mac"></a>MacOS 9.x.</b> Hardly surprising, isn't it, that tunneling
    using Mac OS 9 is trivially easy? The concepts are the same as for Windows,
    Linux, or Mac OS X, as are the numbers, etc. But, in a nutshell, here's what
    you do. It's a two-step process. First, you must configure MacSSH, then configure
    the CVS client. </p>
  <h4>Configuring MacSSH</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the latest version of <a href="hhttp://www.macssh.com">MacSSH,</a> which
      is characteristically easy to use, is free, Open Source, and offers superior
      performance.</li>
    <li>Configure it by clicking on the &quot;Favorites&quot; pull-down menu
      in the top-navbar. </li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;New&quot; button.</li>
    <li>Enter a name for this favorite. If it is going to be your default, don't
      bother. </li>
    <li>Host Name: openoffice.org</li>
    <li>Port: 22</li>
    <li>Terminal: default</li>
    <li>Go now to &quot;SSH2&quot; tab.</li>
    <li>Encryption: <b>3DES</b></li>
    <li>Authentication: <b>MD5</b></li>
    <li>Compression: <b>zlib</b></li>
    <li>Method: <b>Local TCP port forward</b></li>
    <li>Local port: <b>2401</b></li>
    <li> Remote host: <b>localhost</b></li>
    <li> Remote port: <b>2401</b></li>
    <li>You now must initialize (create) your SSH2 key pair. Click on the &quot;Initialize
      SSH&quot; button. Follow instructions.</li>
    <li>Export your key (that is, put it elsewhere) by clicking on the &quot;Export&quot; button. </li>
    <li>Once your key has been loaded by the helpful and friendly staff at OpenOffice.org,
      you will be notified; and then you will be able to establish a tunnel. </li>
    <li>And, as is the case with tunnels: once established, there is no shell.
      At most you will receive a message in a window saying that you are connected.
      That is all. Leave this open, though you may minimize the window.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Configuring Mac CVS Clients</h4>
  <p>There are several free and easy-to-use CVS clients for the Mac. Each has
    its shortcoming (among them being the inane similarity of names) but I prefer
    two: <a href="http://www.maccvs.org" target="_blank">MacCVSPro</a>, and <a href="http://www.heilancoo.net/MacCVSClient/" target="_blank">MacCVSClient</a>.
    Both allow port forwarding (so you can use the tunnel) and both are easily
    configured. The data is the same for both. As well, for both you <i>must</i> create
    a folder for he CVS files. This can be done within the client or outside.
    I suggest you do it first, and that you clearly identify your folder. </p>
  <p><b>Note: I am providing all the information you <i>may</i> need. Not all
      this information is required by the clients.</b>
  </p><ul>
    <li>Remote Host information: localhost</li>
    <li>CVS Root: /cvs</li>
    <li>CVs User Name: The same as your OpenOffice.org login user name</li>
    <li>CVs Password: The same as your OpenOffice.org login password</li>
    <li>CVs command: CVS</li>
    <li>Port: 2401</li>
    <li>Method: Pserver</li>
    <li>Default Module: The module to which you have access.</li>
    <li>Do not allow &quot;Auto Merge.&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above information should be all you need. If you receive error messages
    (a &quot;1&quot; in CVS), you may not have correctly set up your tunnel or
    have a bad password. As well, be sure to put the preceding slash &quot;/&quot; <i>before</i> the
    cvs (lowercase) root. If it's not there, you won't be able to checkout material.</p>
  <p><b>Windows</b><a name="windows"></a>. If you are using Windows (NT or 9x
    or 2K), then please use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>.
    Cygwin, from Cygnus Solutions, provides a nearly full Unix environment on
    your desktop. Cygwin has been updated to load quickly and easily. It also
    generates the keys in the proper format for OpenOffice.org. We recommend
    Cygwin and do not recommend any other client.</p>
  <h3>Using Cygwin: Free and Open Source Unix Terminal Emulator<a name="cygwin"></a></h3>
  <h4>Generating the Key with Cygwin: Unix Commands</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Open Cygwin. If properly configured, Cygwin should start in your home
      directory. To check that it does, type in "<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">pwd</font>" at
      the prompt. (The command requests bash to respond with the working directory.)
      If the answer does not correspond to your home directory, type in "<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cd</font>." This
      relocates the working directory to your home directory. </li>
    <li>Enter "<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ssh-keygen -d</font>." This
      commands the program to generate an SSH2 key (the -d extension specifies
      a DSA or SSH2 key). Depending on the speed of your processor, it could
      take anywhere from several seconds to several minutes. When finished, it
      will prompt you for a file in which to save the key. You should accept
      the default; or, you can specify a file and directory in which to save
      the key, but doing so can be a pain, unless you are familiar (or wish to
      be become familiar) with Unix file structures.</li>
    <li>You will then be asked to enter a passphrase. You must enter a passphrase. Your key will not work unless you enter one. 
      Remember this passphrase: you will be asked for it every time you log into
      the SSH2 server to which you have connected using this public key. </li>
    <li>If you have entered a passphrase correctly (and you will be asked twice
      to be sure you aren't typo-ing your way into a mistake), you will then
      be told that the "identification" has been saved in the file you stipulated,
      and that the "public key" has been saved in a file bearing that same name
      but with a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">.pub</font> suffix.
      The .<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">pub</font> signifies that
      it is the public key.</li>
    <li>For details on submitting the key, see the section below, &quot;Submitting
      Your Certificate (Public Key).</li>
    <li>Note: you are going to use CVS via the tunnel. Your CVSROOT needs therefore
      to point to your localhost to use the tunnel.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4><a name="HowtoConnect"></a>Tunneling with the Cygwin: Unix
    commands </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First, begin the program.</li>
    <li>At the prompt, enter "<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ssh -2
        -x -L 2401:localhost:2401 tunnel@openoffice.org</font>"</li>
    <li>The server should ask you for your passphrase. Enter it. If the passphrase
      is entered wrongly, the server will immediately ask for your password.
      This request indicates a failure. You should try again, and hope for better
      luck.</li>
    <li>If this is your first time, the server will send you a message along
      these lines:
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Host key not found from the
            list of known hosts. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Are you sure you want to
            continue connecting (yes/no)?</font> </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Enter "<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Yes</font>." You can't
      just enter "y"; you have to spell it out.
    </li><li>The server will then respond with: "Host "<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">openoffice.org</font>" added
      to the list of known hosts."
    </li><li>The screen does not show a prompt. It may, at most, say something. That's
      how it should be. The tunnel has been established. You are now ready to
      begin using CVS.
    </li><li>But: Your CVSROOT needs to point to your <span class="TypewriterPlain">localhost</span> to
      use the tunnel
    </li><li>You can, at this point, minimize the terminal, but do not close it or
      enter <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Ctrl-C (^C)</font>. Doing
      so will kill the terminal tunnel.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Submitting Your Certificate (Public Key)<a name="sendingkey"></a></h4>
  <p>Regardless of the way the public key has been created, it needs to be sent
    to OpenOffice.org and accepted by OpenOffice.org administrators.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> To submit the key, attach the .<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">pub</font> file
      as an attachment to an IssueZilla issue. (To use IssueZilla you must be
      registered; but, then, to actually use the key you have to be a registered
      user.) Assign it to "ssh2key@openoffice.org" in the &quot;www&quot; component.
      Explain in the issue what modules you wish access to. (The key takes up
      one very long line; it cannot be broken into more than one line, and anything
      that does that violates the integrity of the key. That's why you need to
      attach the file to the issue.)</li>
    <li> We will then send you an acknowledgment alerting you of your ability
      to use the certificate to tunnel to OpenOffice.org. Should you run into
      difficulties, do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:ssh2key@openoffice.org">ssh2key@openoffice.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Note: Your CVSROOT needs to point at your localhost to use the tunnel</li>
  </ol>
  <h4><a name="whattodo"></a>What to do after you have a tunnel</h4>
  <p>Okay, you've come this far. If you've done everything right, you will have
    a tunnel on your desktop to the server housing the CVS repository. This tunnel
    is <i>not</i> a shell, i.e., you will not see any of the more or less familiar
    Unix elements, just a perplexingly blank screen, and a message indicating
    when you last logged in.. And this is the way it should be. </p>
  <p>What you must do now: Log on to CVS. As mentioned before, this document
    does not touch upon CVS protocols, only how to establish an SSH tunnel. But,
    to emphasize the issue, the establishment of the tunnel is distinct from
    loggin into the CVS repository. The tunnel only <i>enables</i> you to log
    in. For documentation on how to use CVS, please see the Help on <a href="ddCVS.html">CVS</a>.</p>
  <p>See below,<a href="#cvs"> How to use CVS with a tunnel</a>.</p>
  <p class="Header">See also the <a href="http://website.openoffice.org/support/en/howtos/1.html">new
      document</a> generated by Miljenko Williams of Website that does a fine
      job of explaining not only tunneling and Cygwin, but also CVS.</p>
  <h4><a name="cvs"></a>How to use CVS with a tunnel</h4>
  <p>The tunnel is a conduit for cvs data. When you initiate a tunnel following
    the instructions above, you  are connecting to the CVS server. The tunnel,
    which is more a window into the server, becomes your designated CVS host.
    You need only supply the correct password for the CVS server; it is the same
    as your OpenOffice.org user password. Thus, the process is:</p>
</div>

<ol>
  <li> Establish a tunnel. If it works, you will be asked for your passphrase
  (not password, a sign of failure)</li>
  <li>Initiate the CVS connection. You use :pserver; the server is &quot;localhost&quot;
    (the tunnel), and you use your regular OpenOffice.org username.
    <ul>
      <li>E.g., cvs -d :pserver:[username]@localhost:/cvs login </li>
 
    </ul>
  </li>
<li>The regular set of CVS commands obtains. Just keep in mind you are going through the localhost tunnel, that you are not connecting to the CVS server outside of the tunnel.
</li></ol>
  <h4>Terminating the tunnel<a name="terminating"></a></h4>
  <p>The easiest way to terminate the tunnel is to Ctrl-C (^C) it out of existence.
      In both the Mac OS and Windows environment, you can also close the client
    window, thereby shutting the tunnel down.</p>

   <p>The <b>Project Home</b> page is the project's focal point with information that the project owner wishes to share with members and nonmembers alike. Because project home pages can be customized, these vary greatly, depending on the project owner's preferences. At a minimum, the owner should include content describing the nature and goals of the project. Interested users can also use the project's links in the navigation bar to learn more about the project, including subscribing to that project's mailing lists.</p>

   <p>If you are not already a member of the project, you will see the <b>Join this project</b> and <b>Watch this project</b> links. The <b>Join this project link</b> allows you to join the project. Once you have joined the project, you'll find additional links on th <b>Project Home</b> page that you can use to request a new project role. The <b>Watch this project</b> link allows you to add a link to the project's home page to your <b>Start page</b> without becoming a member. This gives you quick access to projects that you want to follow but are not ready to join.</p>

   <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

   <h3>Commitment</h3>

   <p>We are committed to respecting the privacy of our visitors and users. The policy outlined here is our pledge to protect your personal information. If you have any questions or other feedback about our privacy policy, please contact us at (appropriate email address). We will be happy to address your concerns</p>

   <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

   <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>

   <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

   <p>Collab.Net, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>

   <h3>Anonymity</h3>

   <p>You can explore most of this website without providing any information about yourself. We do use tools to track the domains from which people visit us in order to compile reports of aggregate visitor information. All individual users remain entirely anonymous.</p>

   <h3>Registration</h3>

   <p>In order to participate as a developer or project sponsor on Sourcecast, Collab.Net, Inc. may require certain personal contact information including your name, postal address, phone number, and email address. Other personal information such as a fax number is optional. In addition, in order to conduct financial transactions a valid Taxpayer Identification Number or United States Social Security Number may be required. Collab.Net, Inc. will use this information in order to facilitate the effective use of the tools provided on this site. This information will not be shared with third parties.</p>

   <p>We will always notify you before collecting any information and will let you know exactly how we intend to use it.</p>

   <h3>Cookies</h3>

   <p>Sourcecast uses cookies at a very minimal level, only where we consider the technology to be beneficial and necessary. When you visit the site, a cookie is written to save your Sourcecast session ID. That's it. Sourcecast does not use cookies for any other purpose, nefarious or otherwise. You must enable cookies in your browser in order to log in to the site.</p>

   <p>We respect your privacy, and we understand the concerns many people have regarding the use of cookies. We have limited the size and scope of the cookies to benefit from this technology without abusing it. Some of those benefits include:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>A higher level of security than is possible with htaccess;</li>

    <li>Greater site functionality and customization;</li>

    <li>Performance gains from load-balancing and streamlined processing.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Obviously we want the site to be highly functional and secure ... and we think users do, too. Cookies enable us to do that.</p>

   <h3>Accuracy</h3>

   <p>We do our best to maintain the accuracy of personal information you supply to us. You can modify personal information through the user maintenance tool.</p>

   <h3>Security</h3>

   <p>We will take appropriate steps to protect the information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

   <p>Collab.Net, Inc. decided to implement SSL security with a digital certificate for certain pages on this site dealing with sensitive information transfer. For example, we use SSL for the following pages:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>Login - to encrypt password information</li>

    <li>Registration/Account Maintenance - to protect contact information and password.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Because of the significant performance penalties associated with encryption, Sourcecast does not currently encrypt other pages that do not warrant the same degree of security. Therefore, you will get an alert message when you move from secure to insecure pages while navigating this site.</p>

   <h3>SSL on Sourcecast</h3>

   <p>Collab.Net, Inc. uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology on Sourcecast. SSL establishes a secure connection between the user and the server and uses a private key to encrypt data that is transferred across this connection. In addition, the project administration tool available through Sourcecast allows project managers to grant specific permissions for individual users and developers.</p>

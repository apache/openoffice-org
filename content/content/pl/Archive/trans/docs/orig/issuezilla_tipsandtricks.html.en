   <p>Here are a few guidelines to help you effectively make use of issue tracking in your collaborative development projects.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>When you see an issue come through email channels, this is an indication that you have either been assigned or cc'd on a particular issue. Don't ignore it!</li>

    <li>Make frequent use of the "My issues" option in the IssueZilla tool bar. This list displays all project issues assigned to you.</li>

    <li>If you are assigned an issue and you have the bandwith, <strong>it is your responsibility to investigate the issue</strong>. If it has been given a milestone, is also your responsibility to "fix" the issue in the proper order by the designated date, <i>or</i> to communicate the reasons for not meeting the milestone date using the issue "comments" field.</li>

    <li>If you are assigned an issue and you do <i>not</i> have enough time to do the work, it is your responsibility to communicate (through the description field) your inability to complete the assignment.</li>

    <li>Don't just go and fix issues that have not been given a milestone. It is extremely important for the project leader to carefully consider the impact the milestone's changes might have on the codebase. An issue without a milestone indicates that other factors have yet to be determined.</li>

    <li>Proceed through your issues in order sorted by milestone, then by priority. If it makes sense to modify the sequence that's fine, just don't blow the milestone!</li>

    <li>When an issue is completed (you've written the code, etc.), if applicable check it into CVS and mark the issue "fixed." Include a comment on how you did it. Fixed=Checked In!</li>

    <li>Try not to batch up a bunch of issue fixes and check them in all at once. This wreaks havoc on the project administrator's ability to track status and prohibits granular roll backs, etc.</li>

    <li>Feel absolutely positively free to add more issues to the list as you realize them. <strong>Just be sure to query the issue database first to avoid entering duplicate issues!</strong></li>

    <li>Post any and all comments/notes pertaining to a particular issue using the description field. This way anyone who is handling an issue can easily see its history and get to work on it. The issue tracker <strong>must</strong> reflect all of your changes for project release notes to be accurate.</li>

    <li>Refer to the issue tracker on an almost constant basis. In practice you'll find that this is a very efficient way of seeing what is expected of you rather than sifting through emails.</li>
   </ul>

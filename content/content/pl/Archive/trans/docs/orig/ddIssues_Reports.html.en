   <p>Issue tracker includes built-in reporting for a snap-shot status review of issue activity. To generate statistical reports on your project's issue-handling performance, click the <strong>Reports</strong> link on the Issue tracker page.</p>
   <p>You can tailor the report to fit your specific needs both in which issues are included and by how the output is sorted. You can define your report output based on the following criteria:</p>
   
   <ul>
     <li><strong>View</strong>: This field allows you to choose the superset of issues to include in the report. The available options are All issue, Closed issues, High priority (P1, P2) issues, My issues, and Open issues. If you check the <strong>show links to individual issues (not issue counts)</strong> checkbox below this field, the report output will contain active links to each issue included.</li>
     <li><strong>Type</strong>: This field allows you to limit the report to the specified issue types. You can multiple issue types by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking the selection. If no types are selected, the report output will include all issue types.</li>
     <li><strong>Containing</strong>: This field allows you to define a case-insensitive substring. Only those issues which contain this substring in either the summary, description or status whiteboard fields will be included in the report output.</li>
     <li><strong>Rows</strong>: This field allows you to choose the issue attribute to use at the row header. The report will group all issues in rows by the selected attribute.</li>
     <li><strong>Columns</strong>: This field allows you to select the issue attribute to use as the column header. The report will group issues in columns by the selected attribute.</li>
   </ul>

# Use this script to fetch all a project's webcontent for the projects
# listed in the specified file (typically, webcontent-list.txt).
#
# See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/OOo-Sitemap
# for a note on the checkout from the Kenai svn repository.
#
# USAGE:
#   $ ./kenai2website.sh PROJECT
#
#     PROJECT is the name of the project to convert.
#
#     Here are the steps performed.
#
#     1. svn export.
#     2. dos2unix fixup. Change DOS2UNIX to fit your OS.
#     3. compare with AOOo site. Either
#        a) if project exists in AOOo site then find out what differs
#        b) if project does not exist then moves the directory into the AOOo site content.
#           The contents are tested to see what url fixups may be needed.
#           Additional steps are manual. Do test site builds, image url cleanup, other fixups.
#           Once satisfied then do "svn add PROJECT"
#

if test "$#" != 1; then
  echo "USAGE: $0 PROJECT"

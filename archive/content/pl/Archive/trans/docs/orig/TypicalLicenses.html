<p>OpenOffice.org uses a dual license strategy for the source code. These licenses 
  are the GNU General Public License and the Sun Industry Standards Source License. 
  When the GPL license is used, the libraries and component functionality of the 
  OpenOffice.org source code will be licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public 
  License (LGPL), which is completely compatible with the GPL license. We encourage 
  users to use the GPL/LGPL licenses and participate fully in the OpenOffice.org 
  community. 
<p>Copies of the licenses are available here: 
<ul>
  <li><a href="../licenses/gpl_license.html">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL)<br>
  <li><a href="../licenses/lgpl_license.html">GNU Lesser General Public License 
    </a> (LGPL)<br>
  <li><a href="../licenses/sissl_license.html">Sun Industry Standards Source License</a> 
    (SISSL)<br>
</ul>
<p>Dual licensing of the OpenOffice.org source code provides open and free access 
  to the technology both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies 
  that cannot use the GPL. Dual license is common practice in open source projects 
  like Perl and Mozilla. Through the combined use of GPL/LGPL and SISSL, developers 
  will have a high degree of freedom yet compatibility and interoperability will 
  be preserved. 
<p>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the OpenOffice.org source code. 
  The only question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute 
  modifications to the community. The GPL and SISSL licenses allow different ranges 
  of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, 
  any and all incompatible changes must be published openly. 
<p> You must submit copyright back to us when you send us changes. Please see 
  the <a href="../copyright/assign_copyright.html">copyright assignment page</a> 
  for specifics. 
<p>Please visit the <a href="../FAQs/main_faq_new.html#licensing">FAQ</a> section for 
  more information on the OpenOffice.org licenses.

<dt><b>Description</b></dt>
<dd>specifies actions which can be transported with content events.

 </dd>
<dd><p>
 The situations under which contents will send ContentEvents of the various
 action types are described below. The description is broken into a list of
 useful definitions, a list of events that happen to contents, and a list of
 reactions taken by contents in response to those events.
 </p>

 <p>
 The definitions are as follows:
 </p>

 <table border =1>
 <tr><td>D1</td><td>A content C has an identifier id(C).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>D2</td><td>A content C is in one of two states, Alive or Deleted.
 </td></tr>
 <tr><td>D3</td><td>A folder content F has a set of children H(F) that is a
 set of content identifiers. For example, an "open"
 command will usualy return a subset of the contents
 denoted by H(F).</td></tr>
 </table>

 <p>
 The events that can happen to contents (and that are of interest in this
 context) are listed next. Note that 'event' here does not mean an
 ContentEvent, but rather some event that occurs either because some content
 processes a command, or because a content gets informed about a relevant
 change in the underlying system it represents.
 </p>

 <table border =1>
 <tr><td>E1</td><td>The identifier of a content C changes from id1(C) == A
 to id2(C) == B, denoted as E1(C: A->B). For example,
 this event may occur when content C processes a
 "setPropertyValues" command changing its "Title" propery,
 or when afolder that hierarchicaly contains C changes
 its identity.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>E2</td><td>The state of a content C changes from Alive to Deleted,
 denoted as E2(C). For example, this event may occur when
 content C processes a "delete" command, or when a content
 representing an IMAP message gets informed by the IMAP
 server that the message has been deleted.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>E3</td><td>The set of children of a folder content F is enlarged by
 some identifier A (that was not previously in that set,
 i.e., !(A in H1(F)) && (A in H2(F))), denoted as E3(F, A).
 For example, this event may occur when a new content
 created at folder F processes its "insert" command, or
 when a folder representing an IMAP mailbox gets informed
 by the IMAP server that a new message has arrived at that
 mailbox.</td></tr>
 </table>

 <p>
 Finally, the list of reactions taken by contents in response to the above
 events gives a description of what kinds of ContentEvents are sent in which
 situations:
 </p>

 <table border =1>
 <tr><td>R1</td><td>E1(C: A->B) results in C sending an EXCHANGED
 ContentEvent, which then results in the following: All
 folders F that used to have A as a child, but will not
 have B as a child, i.e., (A in H1(F)) && !(B in H2(F)),
 send a REMOVED ContentEvent.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>R2</td><td>E2(C) results in C sending a DELETED ContentEvent,
 which then results in the following: All folders F that
 used to have A as a child, but will not continue to have
 A as a child, i.e., (A in H1(F)) && !(A in H2(F)), send
 a REMOVED event.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>R3</td><td>E3(F, A) results in F sending an INSERTED event.</td></tr>
 </table>

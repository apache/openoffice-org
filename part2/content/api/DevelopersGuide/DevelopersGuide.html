<h1>The Developer's Guide has moved into the Wiki</h1>

  <p>The Developer's Guide has moved into the OpenOffice.org wiki. You will be redirected automatically in a few seconds. 
  If you encounter any problems please click <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/OpenOffice.org_Developers_Guide">Developer's Guide</a> manually.</p>

  <p>Currently no PDF version is available but we hope that we can provide a new generated version based on the wiki content
  in the near future. The advantage of the wiki is that the guide will be more uptodate and it can be easier maintained. 
  We are looking also forward to more contributions in the wiki version.</p>

  <p>Thank you</p>
